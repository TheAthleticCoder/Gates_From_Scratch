the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta ' s recent primary election produced `` no evidence ' ' that any irregularities took place .	134.71964
the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta ' ' for the manner in which the election was conducted .	51.509403
the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities ' ' in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr . .	80.98641
`` only a relative handful of such reports was received ' ' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city ' ' .	34.08566
the jury said it did find that many of georgia ' s registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ' ' .	111.11732
it recommended that fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ' ' .	86.27863
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ' ' .	146.19196
however , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ' ' .	67.670876
the city purchasing department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ' ' .	62.63689
it urged that the city `` take steps to remedy ' ' this problem .	64.8111
implementation of georgia ' s automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .	83.47508
it urged that the next legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ' ' .	105.93645
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department ' s handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .	134.65729
`` this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program ' ' , the jury said , but the state welfare department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county , which receives none of this money .	66.61583
the jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ' ' .	149.55685
nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds ' ' , the jurors said .	126.13909
`` failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden ' ' on fulton taxpayers .	69.00684
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary ' s court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .	98.5323
the jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations ' ' of two previous grand juries , the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee .	168.57951
`` these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court ' s wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms ' ' , the jury said .	112.905754
regarding atlanta ' s new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge jan . 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences ' ' .	125.34249
the jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ' ' .	62.389355
on other matters , the jury recommended that ( 1 )	20.814077
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail ' ' .	128.28107
fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable ' ' pension plan for city employes .	75.7488
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department , the fulton tax commissioner ' s office , the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms , grady hospital and the fulton health department .	52.548283
mayor william b . hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , pearl williams hartsfield , in fulton superior court friday .	81.479004
the couple was married aug . 2 , 1913 .	52.357006
they have a son , william berry jr . , and a daughter , mrs . j . m . cheshire of griffin .	31.861887
attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon .	221.36601
the petition listed the mayor ' s occupation as `` attorney ' ' and his age as 71 .	90.26867
it listed his wife ' s age as 74 and place of birth as opelika , ala . .	55.16637
the petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year .	87.530785
the hartsfield home is at 637 e . pelham rd . aj .	67.92168
henry l . bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor ' s attorney .	68.10978
hartsfield has been mayor of atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 .	114.1633
his political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 .	102.32566
the mayor ' s present term of office expires jan . 1 .	58.410564
he will be succeeded by ivan allen jr . , who became a candidate in the sept . 13 primary after mayor hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection .	60.529152
georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor ' s race , a top official said wednesday .	56.482063
robert snodgrass , state gop chairman , said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .	200.13634
state party chairman james w . dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept . 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen . john tower will be the featured speaker .	187.51987
in the blue ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .	90.9761
despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to republicans who attended .	122.12255
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents .	98.23151
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken 1	228.04175
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2	88.99106
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform .	120.20732
sam caldwell , state highway department public relations director , resigned tuesday to work for lt . gov . garland byrd ' s campaign .	31.151993
caldwell ' s resignation had been expected for some time .	31.556162
he will be succeeded by rob ledford of gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .	34.43207
when the gubernatorial campaign starts , caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for byrd .	124.75842
the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly .	216.20703
before adjournment monday afternoon , the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made .	65.81412
gov . vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment .	173.5157
vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item .	138.26888
meanwhile , it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds .	102.08554
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia ' s most heavily traveled highways .	97.778015
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work .	149.10704
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities .	107.94434
vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov . marvin griffin .	135.3482
the highway department source told the constitution , however , that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .	98.966545
schley county rep . b . d . pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the body ' s action of friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances .	191.54643
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie ' ' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .	93.16942
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 87-31 .	97.87933
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 29-5 .	31.107975
as of sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action .	189.76894
pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions .	403.23282
a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past .	166.94714
rep . mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended ' ' as state funds .	112.41491
barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed ' ' .	76.98498
but he added that none of georgia ' s congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .	175.18742
the resolution , which barber tossed into the house hopper friday , will be formally read monday .	148.37254
it says that `` in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds ' ' , the state board of education should be directed to `` give priority ' ' to teacher pay raises .	56.242416
-- after a long , hot controversy , miller county has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election i ever saw in this county ' ' .	62.986774
the new school superintendent is harry davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated felix bush , a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee .	79.44696
davis received 1 , 119 votes in saturday ' s election , and bush got 402 .	107.08502
ordinary carey williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order .	168.55676
`` this was the coolest , calmest election i ever saw ' ' , colquitt policeman tom williams said .	71.475876
`` being at the polls was just like being at church .	652.9052
i didn ' t smell a drop of liquor , and we didn ' t have a bit of trouble ' ' .	21.355947
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however .	227.60938
it was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence .	32.364517
the former county school superintendent , george p . callan , shot himself to death march 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board .	79.46898
during the election campaign , both candidates , davis and bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls .	74.02217
ordinary williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .	612.8387
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .	113.126434
sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise .	380.15387
`` everything went real smooth ' ' , the sheriff said .	61.69815
`` there wasn ' t a bit of trouble ' ' .	12.267851
-- committee approval of gov . price daniel ' s `` abandoned property ' ' act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers .	90.471634
daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures , in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation .	114.04871
under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .	79.47273
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it .	105.1674
daniel termed `` extremely conservative ' ' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug . 31 .	55.71043
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since texas was a republic ' ' .	135.4001
it permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .	160.01901
the bill , which daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .	115.38725
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , daniel declared .	98.1097
dewey lawrence , a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .	89.99692
`` if you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy ' ' , he said .	29.38629
`` you take out of circulation many millions of dollars ' ' .	7.079765
rep . charles e . hughes of sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies ' ' .	125.546165
his contention was denied by several bankers , including scott hudson of sherman , gaynor b . jones of houston , j . b . brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin .	93.37855
cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional ' ' since , he said , it would impair contracts .	86.65634
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last monday .	82.148125
-- senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen . george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties .	65.05545
the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .	101.78894
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house .	52.974052
it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300 , 000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here .	115.96652
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas , harris , bexar , tarrant and el paso would be $451 , 500 , which would be a savings of $157 , 460 yearly after the first year ' s capital outlay of $88 , 000 was absorbed , parkhouse told the senate .	80.71127
the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county , saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school .	68.65212
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps . v . e . ( red ) berry and joe ratcliff .	68.556145
while details are still to be worked out , ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berry ' s proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .	100.59443
`` we ' re getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting ' ' , said ratcliff .	191.88412
`` but i believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also .	111.7484
i ' m willing to stake my political career on it ' ' .	19.665478
rep . berry , an ex-gambler from san antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies .	52.264477
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later .	132.94025
the house passed finally , and sent to the senate , a bill extending the state health department ' s authority to give planning assistance to cities .	78.1837
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar .	113.87298
another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district .	22.119585
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted .	109.46301
without dissent , senators passed a bill by sen . a . r . schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district .	47.32402
money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site .	138.85077
one , by sen . louis crump of san saba , would aid more than 17 , 000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized .	103.00387
instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1 , 000 fine .	80.59374
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league .	151.84265
the other bill , by sen . a . m . aikin jr . of paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds .	115.885
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by sen . frank owen 3 , of el paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas .	95.615746
marshall formby of plainview , former chairman of the texas highway commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections .	116.914696
under formby ' s plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the house , attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court .	45.051846
-- state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay .	145.55133
an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot , when texas votes on a u . s . senator .	77.40047
rep . wesley roberts of seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill .	111.606224
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb . 22 .	113.36879
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot , roberts said .	48.225784
opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn ' t give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .	117.60388
all dallas members voted with roberts , except rep . bill jones , who was absent .	83.213974
-- paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas ' big cities thursday .	544.87933
rep . james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise , a wise county hamlet of 250 people .	237.67096
when the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen . george parkhouse of dallas .	59.749386
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen . parkhouse .	142.16615
the bill would increase from $5 , 000 , 000 to $15 , 000 , 000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .	43.377117
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas .	327.14606
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway cotten ' s attack .	153.25995
the bill ' s defenders were mostly small-town legislators like j . w . buchanan of dumas , eligio ( kika ) de la garza of mission , sam f . collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs .	138.88692
`` this is a poor boy ' s bill ' ' , said chapman .	65.31328
`` dallas and fort worth can vote bonds .	23.38655
this would help the little peanut districts ' ' .	2.074923
-- a houston teacher , now serving in the legislature , proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods ' ' .	167.94069
rep . henry c . grover , who teaches history in the houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods ' ' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate .	150.3309
a normal year ' s work in college is 30 semester hours .	492.19077
grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching .	202.95164
the remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects .	41.408806
`` a person with a master ' s degree in physics , chemistry , math or english , yet who has not taken education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools ' ' , said grover .	94.715805
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses .	188.35977
fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as co-signers of the proposal .	104.27953
-- the board of regents of paris junior college has named dr . clarence charles clark of hays , kan . as the school ' s new president .	68.36149
dr . clark will succeed dr . j . r . mclemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term .	62.06445

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon ' ' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program .	155.06068
the report , culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load .	132.6818
the report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and adc dependency ' ' .	50.903194
the monthly cost of adc to more than 100 , 000 recipients in the county is 4 . 4 million dollars , said c . virgil martin , president of carson pirie scott & co . , committee chairman .	55.139915
`` we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence ' ' , martin said .	160.24335
the volume of adc cases will decrease , martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .	187.00563
these , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc ' ' .	78.85374
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .	142.06097

several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , judge james b . parsons was told in criminal court yesterday .	77.99008
the disclosure by charles bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .	79.34357
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client , alan clements , 30 , a separate trial .	86.09764
bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom .	49.3501
`` the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client ' ' , bellows told the court .	41.68868
`` some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .	73.77685
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others ' ' .	97.0097
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ' ' ? ?	92.898186
`` yes , your honor ' ' , replied bellows .	125.13711
`` what this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case .	48.688427
there is a conflict among the defendants ' ' .	2.936204
-- president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio .	172.67267
the president spent much of the week-end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone .	103.9728
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port , mass . , a white house spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go ' ' toward completion .	171.40369
asked to elaborate , pierre salinger , white house press secretary , replied , `` i would say it ' s got to go thru several more drafts ' ' .	58.840816
salinger said the work president kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia ' s demands and proposals for the city .	87.55655
the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov . 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m . karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means ' ' .	144.92223
karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence ' ' of the 50 persons .	101.28241
he said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens ' ' .	32.64898
karns ' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases .	327.45398
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case ' ' .	34.88977
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j . wexler , special prosecutor .	87.52398
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .	120.78874
mayer goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .	34.38417
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning .	97.55168
karns said it was a `` wrongful act ' ' for wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room ' ' .	100.949486
he said this constituted a `` very serious misuse ' ' of the criminal court processes .	39.657253
`` actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court ' ' , said karns , who is a city judge in east st . louis sitting in cook county court .	83.57648
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .	59.44021
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary ' ' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .	70.05108
the cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .	20.641026
the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns .	31.104807
after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them .	183.89362
-- president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14 . 2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .	100.71677
the president , in a special message to congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .	132.44917
the aged care plan , similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on capitol hill .	78.10203
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .	130.09781
the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4 , 800 of pay per year .	94.09114
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5 , 000 a year and the payroll tax to 6 . 5 per cent -- 3 . 25 per cent each .	35.073147
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .	35.747715
the payroll tax would actually rise to 7 . 5 per cent starting jan . 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .	109.29449
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1 . 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .	109.5802
both figures would go higher in later years .	11.348408
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .	101.3227
these would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .	129.29416
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1	232.52261
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .	66.91378
full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .	183.5299
a patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula ' ' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit .	268.11127
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient .	144.27184
community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .	354.7618
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .	93.25591
he said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay ' ' .	113.3263
`` this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs ' ' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals .	101.694336
`` this is not a program of socialized medicine .	9.2907
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .	226.19493
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital ' ' .	43.634926
they would still be paid by the patient .	21.298277
apart from the aged care plan the president ' s most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .	84.728386
the president said the nation ' s 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .	128.07442
moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can ' t afford the schooling costs .	63.623245
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1 , 500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .	105.24781
the schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2 , 000 a year per student .	85.51924
in addition , the government would pay a $1 , 000 `` cost of education ' ' grant to the schools for each $1 , 500 in scholarship grants .	91.400345
officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5 . 1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .	77.26583
the president recommended federal `` matching grants ' ' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones .	62.535538
in the area of `` community health services ' ' , the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .	83.61084
he asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial ' ' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants ' ' to states to improve nursing homes .	37.952602
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .	129.7679
in the child health field , the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children ' s bureau .	84.979126
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .	234.23335
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .	82.895966
for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .	117.10585
the president said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine .	73.90846
the president said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them ' ' .	97.119255
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .	123.54525
legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the president ' s plan .	60.455715
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .	222.67665
senate republican leader dirksen ( ill . ) and house republican leader charles halleck ( ind . ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .	172.81517
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .	87.84555
house speaker sam rayburn ( d . , tex . ) called the kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing ' ' , but made no prediction on its fate in the house .	111.845535
-- acting hastily under white house pressure , the senate tonight confirmed robert c . weaver as the nation ' s federal housing chief .	109.065994
only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .	291.60086
a number of scattered `` ayes ' ' and `` noes ' ' was heard .	26.343023
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .	173.44812
in the last eight years , all presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .	86.41076
the rule was enforced by demand of sen . wayne morse ( d . , ore . ) in connection with president eisenhower ' s cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedy ' s in 1961 .	52.930103
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .	145.27058
this has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .	243.52805
in oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another ' s problems .	66.57572
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist ' ' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .	128.31815
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence .	171.57558
in the case of portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .	117.24592
the general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .	55.741917
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members ' votes , since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance .	77.58711
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive .	110.28094
even norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the nato line .	137.87714
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .	104.991425
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk ' s speeches as `` inconclusive ' ' .	26.401236
but he hastened to add that , if united states policies were not always clear , despite mr . rusk ' s analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .	103.73925
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited .	69.972694
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite mr . rusk ' s personal popularity , that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .	127.56064
the secretary of state himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .	94.5778
but where the core of nato is concerned , the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states ' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone ' ' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato ' s disposal in european waters .	91.26861
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .	62.345284
the secretary ' s greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east-west friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .	138.555
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .	77.3206
this increase in the `` threshold ' ' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance ' s most difficult problems in the months to come .	86.310814
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .	309.24597
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time .	87.7296
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos .	113.137596
the united states , state department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam .	77.21148
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this .	76.009674
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated .	101.90462
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .	53.158436
the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference .	60.044624
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .	57.41359
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .	163.6096
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .	234.4033
but with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises	125.56107
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression ? ?	127.53193
former vice-president richard m . nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union .	26.571913
he was critical of what he feels is president kennedy ' s tendency to be too conciliatory .	75.312935
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it .	235.89966
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders ' ' in cuba .	82.888054
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn ' t attack the kennedy administration on this score .	54.034325
his reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .	73.70413
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .	543.0874
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b . morton ( r ) of kentucky , chairman of the republican national committee , that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination .	44.0624
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard , boston university , brandeis , and massachusetts institute of technology educators .	137.98907
this group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups ' ' .	68.68484
it recommends that the united states `` seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations	79.63242
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds ' ' .	76.73967
mr . nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation .	242.1196
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated .	126.403114
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos , almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by mr . nixon and the professors .	90.22228
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration .	87.338875
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements .	1285.4677
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .	97.95133
but thus far there has been no response in kind .	367.8009
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .	60.01786
in laos , the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture .	201.88
again and again it asked the communists to `` freeze ' ' the military situation in laos .	32.52674
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate .	74.71288
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service ' ' and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization .	182.26706
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos .	42.04451
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos .	58.812847
there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , thailand and south viet nam .	143.37473
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos .	269.38675
the pro-western government , which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma `` neutralist ' ' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army .	76.98413
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the pro-western government to the hilt .	114.3294
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .	124.90354
one factor was the statement of senator j . w . fulbright ( d ) of arkansas , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee .	39.308434
he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal ' ' of prince souvanna .	51.174686
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states .	22.921877
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation ' ' .	37.60269
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the president ' s committee on juvenile delinquency and crime , to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .	67.86321
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend .	171.59692
the president has also called upon the attorney general , the secretary of health , education and welfare , and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .	42.87926
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l . hackett , a special assistant to the attorney general , as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime .	53.65054
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders .	101.53957
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age .	56.722168
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , raymond h . hawksley , the present city cd head , believes .	144.30576
mr . hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally ' ' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .	125.51301
east providence now has no civil defense program .	5.2283254
mr . hawksley , the state ' s general treasurer , has been a part-time cd director in the city for the last nine years .	38.211006
he is not interested in being named a full-time director .	40.13061
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nation ' s civil defense program , mr . hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .	76.7485
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about $3 , 500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .	138.87016
mr . hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time cd job .	71.605064
one of these men is former fire chief john a . laughlin , he said .	268.47305
along with a director , the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .	140.361
one advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .	89.37677
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said .	88.31587
mr . hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station .	141.17305
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area .	75.41809
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , mr . hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .	58.96156
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in seekonk would be another .	184.90019
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point .	270.86102
mr . hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .	259.4426
such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .	91.43435
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time cd director , mr . hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .	106.42789
one of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .	86.79927
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government .	39.83907
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .	375.93658
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly .	91.8296
the governor ' s move into the so-called `` blue law ' ' controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r . grant , deputy city clerk of central falls .	73.631386
mr . notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july 10 and sent to the state house by miss grant .	71.26771
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .	72.58149
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review , mr . notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty . gen . j . joseph nugent to get `` the benefit of his views ' ' .	55.143833
he will then appoint the study committee with mr . nugent ' s cooperation , the governor said .	39.260033
`` i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings ' ' , mr . notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws ' ' .	52.547268
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales ' ' .	84.74714
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .	53.28241
should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .	67.341156
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws .	125.36514
the statutes , similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath .	58.26152
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday .	165.01779
the only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday ' ' , the council ' s resolution said .	96.89985
the small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community ' ' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors ' ' .	88.16171
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue ' ' to the local government .	31.452955
the council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business ' ' on sunday .	61.99523
they `` operate on a volume basis ' ' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community ' ' .	77.82162
liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , george h . reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .	247.44032
mr . reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheraton-biltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare ' ' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .	81.47784
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .	205.6453
he said he was `` confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 1910 ' ' .	19.243258
that , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade .	75.574394
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party .	26.072084
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track .	39.789585
he steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track ' ' .	44.852093
he said that when he was a socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources .	93.79356
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .	165.21306
mr . reama , who retired as vice president of the american screw co . in 1955 said , `` both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it ' ' .	74.98034
he said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze ' ' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .	119.2403
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , mr . reama said `` a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own ' ' .	64.74419
mr . reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .	58.617928
a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1 , 700 johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .	89.407074
william a . martinelli , chairman of the citizens group of johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr . .	90.06049
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and mr . martinelli happens to hold that post .	68.901794
mr . martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .	114.1283
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work .	75.42913
a difference of opinion arose between mr . martinelli and john p . bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .	96.848434
mr . martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while mr . bourcier said that a special election might be called instead .	102.07532
mr . bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .	88.22807
he assured mr . martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .	97.31297
mr . martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .	110.978004
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .	109.423706
`` after inspiring this , i think we should certainly follow through on it ' ' , he declared .	63.51833
`` it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement ' ' .	75.38307
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission .	55.59446
`` our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement ' ' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town ' ' .	50.01209
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september .	61.242737
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town ' s insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .	108.616394
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .	46.539238
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses ' ' .	50.95102
several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system .	82.98063
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at monday ' s special north providence town council meeting .	106.769615
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a . abatuno to draft the ordinance .	179.56425
at the last session of the general assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .	89.472404
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .	152.0725
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition .	555.4931
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .	94.142296
-- james p . mitchell and sen . walter h . jones r-bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j . hughes , democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the gop is `` campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism ' ' .	69.49288
mitchell was for using it , jones against , and sen . wayne dumont jr . r-warren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park hotel .	87.00679
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club .	94.45557
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of women ' s clubs .	172.48784
hughes said monday , `` it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired .	80.224815
now he ' s gone , the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state ' ' .	27.95783
sunday he had added , `` we can love eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership ' ' .	139.21074
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .	114.91597
`` how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ' ' ? ?	91.19256
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy ' ' while working in his adminstration .	158.70265
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall ' s presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue .	66.85102
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .	267.82007
`` he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign ' ' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign ' ' .	66.00743
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes ' remark .	259.91687
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary .	380.4841
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .	19.20726
state aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority , and making new jersey attractive to new industry .	111.0626
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republican-controlled state senate `` must share the blame for this ' ' .	73.55702
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co . plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .	126.58986
`` but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time ' ' , mitchell said .	51.41087
jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for mitchell .	217.24168
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises .	132.6773
`` he calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can ' t have it both ways ' ' , jones said .	67.65594
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue ' ' .	97.99544
`` i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j . hughes .	94.3295
his reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president ' s leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations .	55.33918
`` i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .	224.80162
`` such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .	116.88677
it can only rebound to mr . hughes ' discredit ' ' .	15.553483
sen . charles w . sandman , r-cape may , said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .	231.03424
sandman , state campaign chairman for jones , was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel , newark , of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones .	205.39117
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican party ' s nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .	122.30951
sandman said `` the announcement that sen . clifford case aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr . mitchell is a dead giveaway .	158.34549
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jersey ' s problems .	132.83423
`` we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr . mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington .	105.41129
`` we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr . mitchell some of the glow of sen . case ' s candidacy of last year .	72.583565
that , too , will fail ' ' .	2.445361
sandman announced the appointment of mrs . harriet copeland greenfield of 330 woodland ave . , westfield , as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee .	85.232925
mrs . greenfield is president of the westfield women ' s republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman .	123.60553
county supervisor weldon r . sheets , who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them .	90.74936
the proposal , sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a `` lip service word ' ' .	95.44133
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .	90.30273
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january , 1964 .	54.86377
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines .	207.43883
the candidacy of mayor james j . sheeran of west orange , for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county , was supported today by edward w . roos , west orange public safety commissioner .	115.097435
sheeran , a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organization ' s candidate , freeholder william macdonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy , now a member of the state board of tax appeals .	66.00492
`` my experience as public safety commissioner ' ' , roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .	86.497696
-- william j . seidel , state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development , has retired after 36 years of service .	47.0464
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a . bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state .	69.486885
seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies .	70.63548
in october 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section .	144.96404
under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting .	288.41147
he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station .	183.79736
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens .	107.11949
he is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the red cross and state department of education .	81.526566
-- richard j . hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state ' ' .	68.165665
he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn `` when i come back here after the november election you ' ll think , ' you ' re my man -- you ' re the kind of governor we ' re glad we elected ' ' ' .	82.560814
he said , `` we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time ' ' .	45.037594
in his only attack on the republicans , hughes said , `` the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .	97.826004
but we ' ll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .	333.7615
we ' ll not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson .	94.72439
`` we ' ll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november ' ' .	65.52271
he said , `` you can see signs of the republicans ' feeble attack on the meyner administration .	132.34293
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead ' ' .	18.469852
he urged new jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy ' ' .	42.19517
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .	80.957535
`` we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean ' ' , the former superior court judge said .	26.771835
`` to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early 1940s ' ' .	56.570442
calling the democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people ' ' , hughes asked , `` a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november ' ' .	71.57052
hughes supported gov . meyner ' s `` green acres ' ' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development .	133.60956
he said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday .	59.83589
the plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state .	86.51824
the other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis .	33.46771
hughes said , `` this is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it ' ' , pointing out the state population has increased 125 , 000 each year since 1950 .	79.83736
he said `` morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve ' ' .	89.08174
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved .	106.97386
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans .	78.226105
`` after the primary ' ' , he promised , `` i ' ll be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration .	67.353714
i ' m not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee ' ' .	16.2342
-- fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .	201.5029
the outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the april 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by .	188.2741
there may be other 1961 state committee retirements come april 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters .	131.5407
a special presentation was made to mrs . geraldine thompson of red bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .	126.775604
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women ' s suffrage amendment .	62.40236
she served one four-year term on the national committee .	7.7139344
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r . screvane and abraham d . beame as running mates .	124.4052
at the same time reaction among anti-organization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayor ' s reported plan was generally favorable .	75.83894
some anti-organization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .	52.72905
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayor ' s efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .	136.46767
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr . wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .	37.78327
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr . wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept . 7 democratic primary .	97.91075
these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr . wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city .	44.964108
their view is that last-minute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor .	85.585335
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , mr . wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a . buckley , the bronx democratic leader , and with joseph t . sharkey , the brooklyn democratic leader .	65.36724
as usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g . de sapio , the manhattan leader .	57.76641
he is publicly on record as believing mr . de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party .	54.995518
last night the mayor visited mr . buckley at the bronx leader ' s home for a discussion of the situation .	47.359676
apparently he believes mr . buckley holds the key to the democratic organization ' s acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .	69.56383
in talks with mr . buckley last week in washington , the mayor apparently received the bronx leader ' s assent to dropping controller lawrence e . gerosa , who lives in the bronx , from this year ' s ticket .	61.231293
but mr . buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr . gerosa ' s successor .	63.737747
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr . screvane , who lives in queens , to replace abe stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for president of the city council and mr . beame , who lives in brooklyn , to replace mr . gerosa as the candidate for controller .	70.77
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx .	196.96175
after his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday ' s new york times .	34.77048
`` it didn ' t come from me .	10.339656
but as i have said before , if i announce my candidacy , i will have something definite to say about running mates ' ' .	66.32543
-- a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts .	186.97601
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics .	200.6532
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same ' ' .	78.33891
`` it ' s ' see joe , see jim ' ' ' , he says .	30.858107
a political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters ' ' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control .	239.84567
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them ' ' .	43.985954
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin o ' connor ' s novel , `` the last hurrah ' ' .	57.21927
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .	15.915841
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .	57.451
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations .	119.4082
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state .	96.4969
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in massachusetts public life .	108.883865
day after day some new episode is reported .	15.775861
the state public works department is accused of having spent $8 , 555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property .	197.52832
an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate .	35.035652
-- congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .	32.628723
in the senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .	92.74633
in the house , the southern-republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administration ' s housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill .	102.95433
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee .	10.93958
it is expected to be reported out tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .	35.05817
the panel ' s action depends on the return of representative james w . trimble , democrat of arkansas , who has been siding with speaker sam rayburn ' s forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor .	62.94822
mr . trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday .	171.35104
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans .	62.44198
the democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .	176.50107
the $6 , 100 , 000 , 000 measure , which was passed last monday by the senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families .	156.75061
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .	162.09383
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee , where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy .	180.22485
they are james j . delaney of queens and thomas p . o ' neill jr . of massachusetts .	52.170444
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 1958 .	89.41164
this would provide for long-term federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .	278.68887
mr . delaney and mr . o ' neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee .	127.394196
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .	39.0309
in the $40 , 000 , 000 budget that has been submitted for congressional approval , $26 , 000 , 000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .	79.2249
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , gordon boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a washington interview .	118.87668
six of these were proposed by religious groups .	4.8139553
they will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in southeast asia , africa , the middle east and latin america .	25.5257
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .	174.46391
there are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example	44.00594
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .	98.023285
the u . s . government is paying for it .	48.1715
the u . s . government pays for all its overseas workers ' ' .	60.050922
`` i don ' t work for the government ' ' , the american said .	64.296555
`` same thing ' ' , he said .	12.946872
and then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem	189.8474
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ?	177.29727
r . sargent shriver jr . , director of the corps , is certain that they can .	103.38892
no religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes .	130.76111
-- at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia , premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming `` look , he took everything i had ' ' ! !	96.218376

indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of asia , africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid .	41.968563
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations .	111.44376
the communist countries allocated more than $1 , 000 , 000 , 000 in economic aid alone last year , according to western estimates .	42.446613
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .	141.59859
in 1960 more than 6 , 000 communist technicians were present in those countries .	112.25443

-- a committee of experts has recommended that a country ' s population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations .	61.031845
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations .	53.225056
one effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india .	96.67768

the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week .	63.724533
the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines	31.073675

they had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation ' ' , she said .	48.468143
the three laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .	58.040993
the princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .	133.57764
the meetings in zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government .	177.44841

-- thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan . 20 .	64.0479
assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f . kennedy and retiring president dwight d . eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route .	113.64347
pennsylvania avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint .	90.73167
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .	13.431409
within view of the avenue are some of the united states government ' s tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .	56.970432
of course , 1600 pennsylvania , the white house , is the most famous address of the free world .	25.54207
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high .	279.4607
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old .	160.18047
in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .	201.3622
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote .	500.85242
in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .	68.42423
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in 1865 is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country ' s most valuable records are kept .	68.679924
also the department of justice building is located where j . edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation .	41.65884
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground .	113.10626
many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square , opposite the white house .	23.358902
in this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen . andrew jackson , hero of the battle of new orleans .	100.14884
moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least 40 marching units .	62.951584
about 16 , 000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .	66.81564
division one of the parade will be the service academies .	71.64547
division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas , the respective states of the president and of vice-president l . b . johnson .	50.173035
then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .	65.814995
division three will be headed by the marines followed by 12 states	316.19666
division four will be headed by the navy , followed by 11 states	147.97186
division five , by the air force followed by 11 states .	61.92087
division six will be headed by the coast guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , puerto rico , the virgin islands , guam , american samoa , the trust territories and the canal zone .	54.29828
-- what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi ? ?	180.7939
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state ' s immediate political future .	143.73424
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- gov . ross barnett .	91.30012
barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .	242.9458
consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year .	161.99368
some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .	222.38855
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor ' s office .	82.98305
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble .	123.66089
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon ' ' he had in the 1960 legislative session .	87.83458
if barnett doesn ' t call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session .	49.45814
the odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .	49.527924
legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22 . 50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating .	203.87056
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .	64.06553
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state ' s congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .	165.8143
with eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic delta district , and congressman frank e . smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature .	110.83432
mississippi ' s relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house .	46.86813
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck .	103.38454
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .	271.1337
barnett , as the titular head of the democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary .	95.09386
with a democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election .	193.6786
now , the picture is clouded , and even us sens . james o . eastland and john c . stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .	104.16504
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .	114.2628
-- the gov . jimmie h . davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor ' s theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .	126.718
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .	369.33975
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government .	132.17499
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .	52.515156
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .	95.5022
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .	117.397026
indeed , the administration ' s curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .	86.11012
the administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .	88.82775
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .	100.0695
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes .	69.64764
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy .	63.500523
if it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .	65.12858
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature .	9.391399
actually , davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .	108.62152
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration .	140.3956
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly .	265.2023
they would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual .	72.56152
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition .	259.279
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .	110.10979
then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .	142.604
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .	106.21774
but if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .	102.542435
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash .	45.091537
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .	140.5305
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma .	53.625755
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .	95.08579
in either case , it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .	169.09985
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .	320.84738
it is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .	40.119026
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature .	59.05942
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .	73.55598
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .	81.56207
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .	142.51753
the new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .	107.15004
city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track ' ' with the city .	106.07
estimates of the city ' s loss in the $344 , 000 job have ranged as high as $200 , 000 .	80.14364
hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co . contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate ' ' bids of competing contractors .	89.910355
the hughes concern then took `` shortcuts ' ' on the project but got paid anyway , hemphill said .	83.21402
the controller ' s charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday	165.03929
the city has sued for the full amount of the $172 , 400 performance bond covering the contract .	136.52226
the philadelphia transportation co . is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project .	305.84436
the signature of harold v . varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project .	86.20824
varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor .	45.321194
managing director donald c . wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter .	75.8631
the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959 .	96.76079
the hughes company and the consolidated industries , inc . , both of 3646 n . 2d st . , filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law .	114.81584
on monday , the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization .	122.29353
business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c . crumlish , jr . .	32.373592
the suit was filed later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms .	281.09772
travelers indemnity co . and the continental casualty co . .	26.557999
at berger ' s direction , the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u . s . district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there .	90.4229
`` i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated ' ' , berger said .	57.705784
the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track .	136.93666
the contract called for overhauling of 102 joints .	4.312232
the city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , hemphill charged .	117.95359
hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint .	133.29622
the bid from a . belanger and sons of cambridge , mass . , which listed the same officers as hughes , was $600 per joint .	157.64447
but , hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint .	75.91492
berger ' s decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference .	76.1566
wagner said the city paid only $37 , 500 to the hughes company .	26.450632
`` we won ' t know the full amount until we get a full report ' ' , wagner said .	75.01048
`` we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond ' ' , berger said .	15.973823
wagner replied , `` can ' t you just see the headline ' city hooked for $172 , 000 ' ' ' ? ?	106.004974
berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount ' ' .	41.198208
douglas m . pratt , president of the ptc , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el .	111.09994
`` we want to find out who knew about it ' ' , pratt said .	20.29676
`` certain people must have known about it ' ' .	8.205389
`` the ptc is investigating the whole matter ' ' , pratt said .	34.438595
samuel d . goodis , representing the philadelphia hotel association , objected on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year .	110.72407
goodis voiced his objection before city council ' s finance committee .	47.31481
for hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , goodis said .	118.57012
his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services .	92.44203
the new fees are expected to raise an additional $740 , 000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2 , 330 , 000 more a year after that .	50.271988
the ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room .	88.448204
the cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 .	36.517197
goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels .	83.54819
the city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457 , 000 a year .	86.72745
the increase also was opposed by leonard kaplan , spokesman for the home builders association of philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses .	141.98479
a proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from councilwoman virginia knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs .	88.14876
the ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog .	249.05196
mrs . knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city ' s services to animal care .	103.2054
in reply , deputy police commissioner howard r . leary said that the city spends more than $115 , 000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43 , 000 in fees .	86.96088
he reported that the city ' s contributions for animal care included $67 , 000 to the women ' s s . p . c . a .	51.520653
$15 , 000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15 , 000 to investigate dog bites .	64.83863
city finance director richard j . mcconnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year .	88.63021
the city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said .	78.65336
the new fee schedule also was supported by commissioner of licenses and inspections barnet lieberman and health commissioner eugene a . gillis .	133.15125
petitions asking for a jail term for norristown attorney julian w . barnard will be presented to the montgomery county court friday , it was disclosed tuesday by horace a . davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last nov . 1 by barnard ' s hit-run car .	112.50001
the petitions will be presented in open court to president judge william f . dannehower , davenport said .	130.61928
barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by judge warren k . hess , and placed on two years ' probation providing he does not drive during that time .	143.29819
he was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning .	121.001625
victim of the accident was robert lee stansbery , 39 .	61.94934
his widow started the circulation of petitions after barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation .	110.91394
the city planning commission on tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the redevelopment authority for the purchase of land in the $300 , 000 , 000 eastwick redevelopment area project .	54.00416
the commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project .	91.527824
one of the agreements calls for the new eastwick corp . to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12 , 192 , 865 .	106.18558
the tract is bounded by island ave . , dicks ave . , 61st st . , and eastwick ave . .	135.25607
it is designated as stage 1 residential on the redevelopment authority ' s master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores .	92.57234
the corporation was formed by the reynolds metal co . and the samuel a . and henry a . berger firm , a philadelphia builder , for work in the project .	122.65397
the second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of stage 1 residential to philadelphia builders eastwick corp . , a firm composed of 10 philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project .	77.889854
the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by dr . constantinos a . doxiadis , former minister of reconstruction in greece and a consulting planner for the new eastwick corp . .	80.75319
the plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic .	50.90511
it provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project .	76.13166
the esplanade eliminates grovers ave . , which on original plans ran through the center of the development .	102.422806
the esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project .	20.770267
kansas city , mo . , feb . 9 ( upi )	36.867092
-- the president of the kansas city local of the international association of fire fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work .	130.45377
battalion chief stanton m . gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles .	47.740604
the battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work .	111.3525
`` i ' d just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and i was lying on the driveway ' ' , he said .	50.54694
gladden ' s wife and two of his sons , john , 17 , and jim , 13 , were inside the house .	141.66565
the younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall .	47.790703
the explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house .	41.21262
the left front wheel landed 100 feet away .	5.5307646
police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either tnt or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel .	182.7843
it was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car ' s starter .	26.127771
gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night .	76.33967
the fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union .	67.8778
gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union ' s battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 .	92.64202
the fire fighters association here offered a $5 , 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing .	63.75149
a $500 reward was offered by the association ' s local in kansas city , kas . .	79.41393
the association said it would post 24 hour guards at gladden ' s home and at those of james mining and eugene shiflett .	79.61298
mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and shiflett is a member of its executive committee .	58.018745
ankara , turkey , oct . 24 ( ap )	2.12407
-- turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen . cemal gursel as president .	183.7284
an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct . 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d ' etat .	96.29617
by-passing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by gen . cedvet sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government .	84.47408
the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen . gursel as president .	143.69244
gen . gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months .	118.20962
the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned .	67.10921
party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own .	149.44643
vincent g . ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced monday by charles e . raymond , district attorney .	34.39951
ierulli will replace desmond d . connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by march 31 .	91.744385
ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in portland since november , 1959 .	111.58536
he is a graduate of portland university and the northwestern college of law .	109.36226
he is married and the father of three children .	8.740336
helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , e . m . martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night .	56.713566
martin , who has been in office in washington , d . c . , for 13 months spoke at the council ' s annual meeting at the multnomah hotel .	33.20924
he told some 350 persons that the united states ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths .	176.05936
`` we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours ' ' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty .	71.79701
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the soviet union .	38.688297
he cited east germany where after 15 years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up ' ' .	117.01553
martin called for patience on the part of americans .	78.34695
`` the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build ' ' , he said .	55.56798
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said .	138.08136
`` we have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient ' ' , the assistant secretary said .	41.166767
economically , martin said , the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves .	144.82448
private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves .	82.35666
the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a `` social cost ' ' .	60.18402

the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portland ' s civil defense more plans for the city ' s schools in event of attack .	89.61041
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow .	152.82988
the board members , after hearing the coordination plea from mrs . ralph h . molvar , 1409 sw maplecrest dr . , said they thought they had already been cooperating .	179.67714
chairman c . richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go .	102.41103
dr . melvin w . barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful ' ' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district .	121.53176
`` los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster ' ' , he said .	47.814007
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following .	82.59503
mrs . molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand ' ' , said , `` we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn ' t be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children ' ' .	60.023384
dr . barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work ' ' .	90.36591
mrs . molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowe ' s program .	175.82143
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting .	110.7019
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done .	105.29254

a stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the assemblies of god , in session at the memorial coliseum .	90.84097
the council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination ' s 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 .	152.6281
the changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible .	82.76957
the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible .	156.98975
at the adoption , the rev . t . f . zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives ' ' .	55.45887
however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list .	276.7459
the first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads	240.5237

`` in 35 years we have opened 7 , 000 churches ' ' , the rev . mr . brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10 , 000 persons .	44.834503

800 in southern new england , we have 60	454.3158
we need 100 in rhode island , we have none ' ' , he said .	17.179657
to step up the denomination ' s program , the rev . mr . brandt suggested the vision of 8 , 000 new assemblies of god churches in the next 10 years .	63.866257

u . s . dist . judge charles l . powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in portland ' s insurance fraud trial .	120.19064
denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict .	51.016975
in denying motions for dismissal , judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are ' ' .	143.35812
attorney dwight l . schwab , in behalf of defendant philip weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy , but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide .	71.82139
schwab also declared there is no proof of weinstein ' s entering a conspiracy to use the u . s . mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor a . lawrence burbank replied	47.630367
`` it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the u . s . mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out ' ' .	48.221737

-- the orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen major-league clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the kansas city athletics by a score of 5 to 3 .	176.41475
indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage .	201.75269
over the first five frames , jack fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 american league pennant , held the a ' s scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .	138.25311
then dick hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock .	295.09122
a two-run homer by norm siebern and a solo blast by bill tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .	151.94109
with one down in the eighth , marv throneberry drew a walk and stole second as hyde fanned tuttle .	104.75419
catcher frank house ' s throw in an effort to nab throneberry was wide and in the dirt .	76.758995
then heywood sullivan , kansas city catcher , singled up the middle and throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .	81.00974
rookie southpaw george stepanovich relieved hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the a ' s fifth tally on a walk to second baseman dick howser , a wild pitch , and frank cipriani ' s single under shortstop jerry adair ' s glove into center .	60.0963
the orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three kansas city pitchers .	123.75545
three were doubles , brooks robinson getting a pair and marv breeding one .	56.31012
bill kunkel , bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in miami stadium .	161.0846
the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth .	91.34963
hartman , purchased by the a ' s from the milwaukee braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph .	128.6447
keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally .	103.400116
in the ninth , robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left .	61.6356
whitey herzog , performing in right as the orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked keegan for a base on balls .	130.16972
pete ward was sent in for house and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to howser on the grass back of short .	199.22751
john powell , batting for adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and buddy barker , up for stepanovich , bounced out sharply to jerry lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest .	186.8418
the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding , along with robinson , the two birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on russ snyder ' s single to right and crossed on kunkel ' s wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate .	98.683754
the flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out .	404.8396
jackie brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .	152.70692
jim gentile bounced a hard shot off kunkel ' s glove and beat it out for a single , and when lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman throneberry ' s head brandt took third and gentile second on the error .	95.11776
then robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners .	257.87503
when robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , tuttle to andy carey .	113.215034
the detailed rundown on the kansas city scoring in the sixth went like this	208.30087
lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face hyde and romped around as siebern blasted hyde ' s next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center .	97.053795
carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first .	261.80908
it was ruled a difficult chance and a hit .	458.33997
then throneberry rapped into a fast double play .	8.279504
breeding to adair to gentile , setting up tuttle ' s 390-foot homer over the wall in left center .	93.35976
if the orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the american league champion new york yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test sunday afternoon .	64.64224
-- the flavor of baltimore ' s florida grapefruit league news ripened considerably late today when the orioles were advised that ron hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the army ' s military training program and is ready for belated spring training .	95.62509
hansen , who slugged the 1960 oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a	71.4754
freshman average , completes the birds ' spring squad at 49 players .	126.894745
the big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 american league `` rookie-of-the-year ' ' , flew here late this afternoon from baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15 , 000 and was a spectator at tonight ' s 5-to-3 loss to kansas city -- the winless birds ' sixth setback in a row .	113.00227
the 6-foot 3-inch hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring .	68.94271
he hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the flock breaks camp three weeks hence .	122.268166
when he was inducted into the army at fort knox , ky . , hansen ' s weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best ' ' he said .	73.957115
`` i feel good physically ' ' , hansen added , `` but i think i ' ll move better carrying a little less weight than i ' m carrying now ' ' .	104.50349
the rangy , albany ( cal . ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding ' ' as his 1961 goal .	95.58917
`` i think i can do a better job with the glove , now that i know the hitters around the league a little better ' ' , he said .	61.21944

pitcher steve barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the army ' s accelerated wintertime military course , also at fort knox , ky . .	116.742775
the 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did hansen .	707.03015
baltimore ' s bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as manager paul richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit .	101.11308
`` take a ride on this one ' ' , brooks robinson greeted hansen as the bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight .	143.3977
it was the first of two doubles by robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate .	70.10852
just before game time , robinson ' s pretty wife , connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer .	196.61934
unfortunately , brooks ' s teammates were not in such festive mood as the orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three kansas city rookie hurlers .	128.74478
hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with lee macphail	530.92334
j . a . w . iglehart , chairman of the oriole board of directors , and public relations director jack dunn .	68.23227

-- george kerr , the swift-striding jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the knights of columbus track meet tonight , beating purdue ' s dave mills in a hot duel in 1 . 10 . 1 .	87.78676
kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in new york with a clocking of 1 . 09 . 3 , wiped out mills ' s early pace and beat the young big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards .	161.56693
both were under the meet mark of 1 . 10 . 8 set in 1950 by mal whitfield .	115.28468
mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .	56.73012

-- a texas halfback who doesn ' t even know the team ' s plays , eldon moritz , ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games .	131.22658
time stands still every time moritz , a 26-year-old army signal corps veteran , goes into the field .	164.63464
although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every saturday , in fact -- out of football .	191.09349
moritz doesn ' t even have a nose guard or hip pads but he ' s one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl .	108.093
that ' s because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries .	188.93736
he ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of washington state .	290.5355
moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team .	153.24147
but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and you ' ll get the quick response , `` place-kicker ' ' .	45.320236
a 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from stamford , moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .	220.99687
last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn ' t get into a single game .	50.688038
`` this year , coach royal told me if i ' d work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me ' ' , said moritz .	57.357876
`` so i started practicing on it in spring training .	76.59476
moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough .	126.46243
moritz said monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week .	79.88153
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school , including one that beat anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game .	246.9719
`` i kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school ' ' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time .	56.18489
i never did miss one in a playoff game -- i kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years ' ' .	76.3428
moritz came to texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury .	62.579
he missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 .	86.1206
his statistical record that year , when texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards .	226.0662
he went into the army in march , 1957 , and returned two years later .	41.572372
but he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season .	422.40445
place kicking is largely a matter of timing , moritz declared .	126.41728
`` once you get the feel of it , there ' s not much to it .	44.76049
i ' ve tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can ' t seem to get the feel .	47.43825
practice helps you to get your timing down .	4.365357
`` it ' s kind of like golf -- if you don ' t swing a club very often , your timing gets off ' ' .	69.49288
moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session .	462.00702
`` if you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead ' ' , he explained .	41.72549
in their first three games , the longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent	85.4354
their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries .	56.02828
tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries	193.46602
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games .	116.19852
saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the washington state game , for four plays he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench .	73.47713
wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists he ' ll be ready for oklahoma .	108.66063
last week , when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conference ' s top four in rushing , he said `` that won ' t last long ' ' .	65.5389
monday , he had four longhorns in the top four .	204.04543
a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday , but attention quickly turned from saturday ' s victory to next week ' s problem rice university .	149.92828
the mustangs don ' t play this week .	17.294529
`` we ' re just real happy for the players ' ' , coach bill meek said of the 9-7 victory over the air force academy .	55.134155
`` i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on .	213.46826
it was the first time we ' ve been ahead this season ( when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) ' ' .	134.57518
assistant coach john cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , i think , on the part of the coaches and the players .	42.339798
we needed it and we got it ' ' .	2.173197
meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon .	128.5944
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .	23.425798
`` nelson played magnificent football ' ' , meek praised .	1036.3838
`` he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times .	113.69496
and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown .	113.50126
he broke that boy ( air force fullback nick arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football ' ' .	59.677547
gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages .	31.014769
one was on a fourth-down screen pass from the mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into gannon ' s territory .	152.04443
`` as soon as it started to form , gannon spotted it ' ' , meek said .	96.09114
`` he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback terry isaacson ) had time to turn around .	112.79883
he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss ' ' .	95.47474
the air force ' s , and the game ' s , final play , was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .	176.46245
`` he just lay back there and waited for it ' ' , meek said .	30.815039
`` he almost brought it back all the way ' ' .	4.468244
except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice , meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice .	110.5571
`` kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game ' ' , meek said .	29.866459
`` he ' ll be out of action all this week .	254.24722
he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .	104.974556
there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee ' ' .	20.574905
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland .	89.404
`` he ' s looking a lot better , and he ' s able to run ' ' , meek explained .	47.349155
`` we ' ll let him do a lot of running this week , but i don ' t know if he ' ll be able to play ' ' .	20.976204
the game players saw the air force film monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .	118.6204
`` we ' ll work hard tuesday , wednesday and thursday ' ' , meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage friday .	60.45992
we ' ll work out about an hour on saturday , then we ' ll work monday and tuesday of next week , then taper off ' ' .	76.89953
smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday , oct . 21 .	64.34612
-- held out of texas tech ' s sweat-suits drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the raiders ' 38-7 loss to texas a & m because of its important game with arkansas coming up saturday , baylor worked out in the rain monday -- mud or no mud .	230.32674
end gene raesz , who broke a hand in the owl ' s game with lsu , was back working out with rice monday , and john nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week ' s idleness with an ankle injury .	124.06534
the texas aggies got a day off monday -- a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night , but myers announced that halfback george hargett , shaken up in the tech game , would not play against trinity saturday .	95.59258
halfback bud priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined tcu ' s workout monday .	78.48211
the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the denver broncos -- but their visit will be a short one .	102.73438
the texans have two more road games -- at buffalo and houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach hank stram ' s men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .	98.015854
buffalo coach buster ramsey , who has become one of the game ' s greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-national football leaguers , m . c . reynolds and warren rabb .	78.15948
rabb , the former louisiana state field general , came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the houston oilers , defending league champions .	148.71423
`` buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ' ' .	161.24014
ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver , and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , jack spikes , though he did the team ' s place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .	113.13873
`` our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well ' ' , said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .	52.645954
`` in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job ' ' .	10.948418
the texans won the game through ball control , with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only 17 passes .	254.00656
`` we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack ' ' , explained stram .	175.61916
`` they can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble ' ' .	191.94298
the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans , but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .	66.374084
the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes , the flashy halfback .	162.18181
he was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards .	124.38995
the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denver ' s al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas .	174.88887
`` that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away ' ' , said stram , quipping , `` i think i ' ll put that play in the book ' ' .	65.374916
the early southwest conference football leaders -- texas , arkansas and texas a & m -- made a big dent in the statistics last week .	93.960754
texas ' 545-yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1 , 512 yards ( 1 , 065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new swc high .	121.92106
arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip tcu , and a & m , with a 38-point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .	191.43915
completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .	102.2486
texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to baylor ' s 126 ) , but idle baylor has the best defensive record ( 187 . 5 yards per game to texas ' 189 ) .	91.990486
a & m has the best defense against passes , 34 . 7 yards per game .	117.24469
not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology .	139.72021
rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis , 5-3 .	120.38618
the husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the denver area .	145.12726
it was nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight .	134.42133
they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack .	47.775368
nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning .	20.030844
he has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .	191.35373
the bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in sunday ' s opener , and never lagged .	114.997696
dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bear ' s attack .	113.780754
after al paschal gruonded out , jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe .	90.59013
alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left .	117.24581
jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don wert ' s smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout .	112.7415
the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzer ' s glove .	87.36937
nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth .	231.67375
chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines ' infield roller accounted for the tallies .	85.550285
the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusik ' s double and outfield flies by porter and wert .	91.37864
gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth .	79.32674
despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1 48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play .	89.14267
chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusik ' s grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .	75.20682
cliff cook accounted for three of the tribe ' s eight hits .	34.322403
it was the season ' s first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order .	48.321117
the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark .	132.48196
mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ .	9.542196
among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , patti waggin who is mrs . don rudolph when off the stage .	110.91563
lefty wyman carey , another denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at 8 o ' clock tuesday night .	47.520195
ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn .	277.72458
dallas , tex . , may 1 -- ( ap )	7.788994
-- kenny lane of muskegon , mich . , world ' s seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over rip randall of tyler , tex . , here monday night .	129.72069
st . paul-minneapolis , may 1 -- ( ap )	1.5431776
-- billy gardner ' s line double , which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field , drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a 6-5 victory over the chicago white sox monday .	106.28284
lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center .	104.7471
he came all the way around on gardner ' s hit before 5777 fans .	196.35147
it was gardner ' s second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year .	61.69315
turk lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while ray moore won his second game against a single loss .	269.6902
the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny green ' s double to left .	127.5784
the white sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly .	72.79417
jim landis ' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a 1-0 lead , but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard .	65.25849
al smith ' s 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and carreon ' s first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front .	85.435036
a double by green , allison ' s run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by lemon and gardner ' s solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth .	151.02876
ogden , utah , may 1 -- ( ap )	1.4483328
-- boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball .	55.168373
`` i ' ve had it ' ' , he told a newsman .	50.661503
`` i know when my reflexes are gone and i ' m not going to be any 25th man on the ball club ' ' .	51.26407
this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout .	89.53784
jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games .	48.286636
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno , nev . , where his wife , former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen , awaited .	87.465195
she said , when she learned jackie was heading home `` i ' m just speculating , but i have to think jack feels he ' s hurting boston ' s chances ' ' .	53.38697
the union pacific railroad streamliner , city of san francisco , stopped in ogden , utah , for a few minutes .	42.473835
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him .	109.780975
the conductor said to ritchie `` i don ' t think you want to talk to him .	24.769531
you ' ll probably get a ball bat on the head .	14.242063
he ' s mad at the world ' ' .	2.0485337
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .	224.42763
`` i told him who i was and he was quite cold .	105.79188
i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( liston ) got was through a keyhole .	150.595
he said he had never talked to liston ' ' .	2.7422814
liston is bill liston , baseball writer for the boston traveler , who quoted jensen as saying	49.818054
just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging .	185.69452
and so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old warren spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the giants and the giants ' willie mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree sunday .	101.94403
both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime .	69.40873
of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahn ' s hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts .	121.40208
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone .	306.42096
and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` wish i was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer .	151.93036
the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days .	130.71902
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game ' s history .	41.282837
yes , with bob grove , carl hubbell , herb pennock , art nehf , vernon gomez , et al .	32.64958
spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player ' s ball player , as they say in the trade .	76.7186
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct . 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18 , 792 .	108.001854
`` spahnie doesn ' t know how to merely go through the motions ' ' , remarked enos slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .	186.71231
the spectacular mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .	75.71258
incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .	327.2592
bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyn ' s ebbetts field .	226.25447
ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies , the braves ' joe adcock , lou gehrig of the yankees , pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito , then with cleveland , made their history on the road .	63.647186
willie ' s big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle .	39.74992
this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you ' re an american or national fan and anti or pro-yankee .	111.1171
the record books , however , would favor the giants ' ace .	41.930176
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .	78.908195
willie ' s lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond mickey ' s .	544.1051
the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukee ' s park .	119.78134
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .	407.2511
the denver-area tv audience was privileged to see mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home .	146.10316
this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game ' s top rulers .	68.12405
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the `` living room athletic club ' ' when games were cut off .	144.64394
actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .	209.50699
this year , i am told , the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here .	170.17097
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .	323.9744
it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .	63.79729
you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy .	145.81789
this dissatisfaction led to howsam ' s request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .	51.37384
-- the powerful new york yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed cincinnati , crushing the reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage monday in the loosely played finale .	71.36315
with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries , the american league champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game .	105.156166
johnny blanchard , mantle ' s replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a 5-run first inning .	48.112637
hector lopez , subbing for berra , smashed a 3-run homer off bill henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth .	134.8726
the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors .	88.3802
the crowd of 32 , 589 had only two chances to applaud .	101.46557
in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on .	127.992676
momentarily the reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .	156.30621
in the fifth , wally post slashed a 2-run homer off bud daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn ' t matter .	84.84725
the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager .	130.10954
only bucky harris , the `` boy-manager ' ' of washington in 1924 , and eddie dyer of the st . louis cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .	30.171665
-- nick skorich , the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles , was elevated today to head coach .	81.474686
skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20 , 000 and $25 , 000 a year .	52.740414
he succeeds buck shaw , who retired at the end of last season .	20.68663
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaw ' s staff -- jerry williams and charlie gauer .	81.40126
skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings , the newest national football league entry .	112.54234
van brocklin , the quarterback who led the eagles to the title , was signed by the vikings last wednesday .	101.31512
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .	71.43901
with skorich at the helm , the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .	131.20349
in the past the club depended largely on van brocklin ' s aerials .	66.78742
skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing .	243.65569
skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at cincinnati university and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers .	129.6981
an injury forced skorich to quit after the 1948 season .	154.78699
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in 1949 .	83.90907
he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy , n . y . .	84.47574
he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach .	55.40152
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers .	229.35626
the eagles signed him for shaw ' s staff in 1959 .	77.54887
at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth , the eagles were honored for winning the championship .	115.2038
shaw and skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .	153.75916
with the announcement of a `` special achievement award ' ' to william a . ( ( bill ) shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for sunday night ' s thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the new york chapter , baseball writers ' association of america , at the waldorf-astoria hotel .	86.29164

a crowd of 1 , 400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song .	62.368443
the 53-year-old shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york .	79.89749
named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james a . farley , bernard gimbel and clint blume , shea worked relentlessly .	186.46532
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city .	158.40024
the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees .	150.98233
despite countless barriers and disappointments , shea moved forward .	47.933697
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another national league club to move here .	161.0201
when that failed , he enlisted branch rickey ' s aid in the formation of a third major league , the continental , with new york as the key franchise .	61.828144
the continental league never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand .	129.3092
the new york franchise is headed by mrs . charles shipman payson .	57.176205
a big-league municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford c . frick .	130.29001
shea ' s efforts figure prominently in the new stadium .	148.81064
shea and his wife , nori , make their home at sands point , l . i . .	105.451866
bill jr . , 20 , kathy , 15 , and patricia , 9 , round out the shea family .	188.47395
he attended new york university before switching to georgetown university in washington .	29.049725
he played basketball there while working toward a law degree .	1030.1719
later , shea owned and operated the long island indians , a minor league professional football team .	31.074528
he was the lawyer for ted collins ' old boston yankees in the national football league .	35.317036
all was quiet in the office of the yankees and the local national leaguers yesterday .	167.46251
on friday , roger maris , the yankee outfielder and winner of the american league ' s most-valuable-player award , will meet with roy hamey , the general manager .	100.53564
maris is in line for a big raise .	19.305704
arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight .	178.11685
the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre .	379.07935
palmer , golf ' s leading money-winner in 1960 , and snead will be saluted as the winning team in the canada cup matches last june in dublin .	102.52723
deane beman , the national amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including bob gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards .	75.34947
the writers ' gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield , n . j . , and palm beach , fla . , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments .	30.402658
horton smith of detroit , a former president of the professional golfers association , will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness .	78.91674
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington , democrat of missouri .	17.788836
arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .	61.213223
he won the masters , the united states open and a record $80 , 738 in prize money .	103.947075
he was heralded as `` sportsman of the year ' ' by sports illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the `` professional athlete of the year ' ' , a distinction that earned for him the $10 , 000 diamond-studded hickok belt .	80.48398
but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .	92.898186
a couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole .	178.17105
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .	161.12946
if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .	177.46889
it was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold .	100.618935
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .	231.39519
the world ' s best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .	63.64491
then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .	178.23792
on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , arnold whipped into his second shot .	60.63462
the ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice .	202.79695
he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .	20.474596
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .	11.853751
`` it is possible that i over-corrected ' ' , he said ruefully .	12.170029
each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .	36.13094
`` it was a nice round figure , that 12 ' ' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed .	76.986336
from the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open .	232.28491
the idol of the hackers , of course , is ray ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the united states open .	52.104923
their secondary hero is another pro , willie chisholm , who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully .	138.21404
willie ' s partner was long jim barnes , who tried to keep count .	32.95149
`` how many is that , jim ' ' ? ?	19.372223
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project .	117.18466
`` thirteen ' ' , said long jim .	36.66133
`` nae , man ' ' , said willie , `` ye must be countin ' the echoes ' ' .	76.15057
nor were there any rules to save him .	4.961467
if there had been , he would have found a loophole , because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .	75.18341
this knowledge has come in handy , too .	22.849405
his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .	79.75049
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .	153.49017
arnold sent for joe dey , the executive secretary of the golf association .	21.462414
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .	128.15353
`` i knew it all along ' ' , confessed arnold with a grin , `` but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there ' ' .	129.17578
for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .	155.29376
he ' ll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he ' s right .	62.59846
that ' s how he first won the masters in 1958 .	125.58652
it happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder .	614.7077
arnold ' s iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force .	104.375694
`` i can remove the ball , can ' t i ' ' ? ?	16.369759
`` no ' ' , said the official .	115.79192
`` you must play it where it lies ' ' .	3.433899
`` you ' re wrong ' ' , said arnold , a man who knows the rules .	59.410965
`` i ' ll do as you say , but i ' ll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling ' ' .	43.510983
he scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one .	181.85243
so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .	59.661358
until a few weeks ago , however , arnold palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers .	120.05123
but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before .	84.38567
a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today .	77.84841
other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football ' s hall of fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments .	177.92586
the owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division .	167.66241
however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .	130.19127
pete rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out	9.94478
`` we ' ll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other ' ' .	71.4663
nine of the league ' s teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .	491.94766
if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies , they won ' t be misled by the pirates ' slower start this season .	117.502815
`` pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat ' ' , mauch said here the other day .	57.114433
`` the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year .	331.44885
they have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season , along with bobby shantz ' ' .	140.31047
tonight at 8 o ' clock the cardinals , who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball ' s world champions .	192.89537
the pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the redbirds are 7-9 .	100.57994
solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from bob gibson to ernie broglio , for several reasons 1 broglio ' s 4-0 won-lost record and 1 . 24 earned-run mark against pittsburgh a year ago	107.76244
2 the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible	388.9159
3 the redbirds ' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the phillies sunday .	56.33289
manager hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment .	253.86212
after thursday ' s open date , solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night .	73.53374
harvey haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonight ' s game at busch stadium .	103.0219
haddix has a 13-8 record against the redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 .	90.11393
pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadn ' t decided between mizell and vern law for wednesday ' s game .	280.67688
after a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup .	47.488686
that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the giants .	131.57922
`` i have to stay with nieman for a while ' ' , hemus said .	66.56832
`` bill white ( sore ankles ) should be ready .	28.007374
with a lefthander going for pittsburgh , i may use don taussig in center ' ' .	78.83269
`` lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good ' ' , hemus said .	35.752434
`` he should be getting back in the groove before long .	209.66109
our pitching is much better than it has shown ' ' .	46.514954
the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice , but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday .	130.5905
until the bucs ' bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .	130.69104
despite the recession , pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess , gino cimoli , bill virdon , bob clemente and dick groat , each	123.43302
bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet .	69.469055
perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend , who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs .	212.03998
friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn ' t likely to see action here this week .	95.15096
`` we ' re getting friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good ' ' , murtaugh said .	51.56778
the pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by may 1 last year , when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season .	186.19353
on last may 1 , the cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone .	107.43819
in 1958 , the birds were 3-10 on may 1 .	47.976055
since 1949 , the st . louis club has been below on may 1 just four times .	101.535164
the ' 49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on may 23 before finishing with 96 victories .	171.3187
the ' 52 cards were 6-7 on may 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club ' s top since 1949 .	81.59471
then last season the birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on may 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .	156.4572
since 1949 , the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the ' 55 dodger team .	180.53537
those dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by may 8 .	448.86917
the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new york ' s ' 51 giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .	89.68192
speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st . louis university players who , in the words of coach john benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than i did ' ' .	67.4966
the most valuable player award was split three ways , among glen mankowski , gordon hartweger and tom kieffer .	116.58374
in addition , a special award was given to bob ( bevo ) nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury .	80.424446
`` you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing ' ' , benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different .	164.44337
the boys had a tremendous respect for each other ' s ability .	86.756645
they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do .	66.89585
`` several times i found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .	140.33008
we ' d be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say , ' don ' t worry , coach -- we ' ll get ' em all right ' ' ' .	61.05953
the trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by bob broeg , sports editor of the post-dispatch .	104.570335
kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play .	110.91251
mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against bradley in st . louis u . ' s nationally televised victory .	54.198753
benington said , `` i ' ve never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day ' ' .	232.54922
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills .	142.62529
after the coach listed all the boy ' s faults , hartweger said , `` coach before i leave here , you ' ll get to like me ' ' .	34.71432
mrs . benington admired gordon ' s spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team .	96.83412
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` i want to thank coach ' s wife for talking him into letting me play ' ' .	69.57196
bob burnes , sports editor of the globe-democrat , presented bob nordmann with his award .	64.39314
bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time .	122.87414
within a week after the injury , suffered in st . louis ' s victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament , nordmann was sitting on the bill ' s bench doing what he could to help benington .	42.24832
on the clock given him was the inscription , `` for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball , 1960-61 ' ' .	139.29898
other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the national invitation tournament were art hambric , donnell reid , bill nordmann , dave harris , dave luechtefeld and george latinovich .	121.89857
`` this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future ' ' , benington pointed out .	33.294582
`` by winning against bradley , kentucky and notre dame on those teams ' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn ' t take a super team to do it ' ' .	98.83191
st . louis university found a way to win a baseball game .	65.7797
larry scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in billiken baseball history , as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college , 5-1 , at crystal city .	156.7468
the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie .	143.85013
the tie was against southeast missouri last friday .	9.156718
scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , len boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple .	169.05421
st . louis u . was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against washington university at ligget field .	384.54605
the game opened a busy week for washington .	3.2671032
the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at 3 30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy , ill . , saturday .	286.9475
if it ' s true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn ' t happy ball players produce more base hits ? ?	193.15565
the two top talents of the time , mickey mantle and willie mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations .	163.94238
and that ' s meant as a boost , not a knock .	136.63246
mays and mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they ' ve never hit the heights .	146.9366
mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the american league in home runs , 52 , and rbi ' s , 130 .	129.74072
like the yankees ' slugger , mays , the terror of the giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- willie .	178.93843
his best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and ' 55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases .	99.49645
now , apparently happier under new managers , mays and mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they ' re going to pass those previous peaks .	162.56761
yes , we know , they ' re professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn ' t care how they ' re handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .	110.384056
the truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment .	91.49
for that matter , stan musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort .	110.63266
mantle , it ' s apparent , resented casey stengel ' s attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility .	67.35452
stengel inherited dimaggio , rizzuto , but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors , from joplin to new york .	158.07443
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , ol ' case wanted no . 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder .	247.4388
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats .	95.82292
inheriting a more mature mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off broadway , ralph houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on mickey .	173.64465
the major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead .	210.94406
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far .	50.806244
the opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in los angeles ' wrigley field jr . , mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , babe ruth ' s 60 homers of 1927 .	112.99294
mays ' day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year .	350.59393
willie ' s wonderful walloping sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark .	196.20116
next to leo durocher , dark taught mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the polo grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the giants win a dramatic pennant .	87.31285

those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation army ' s social center at 1200 larimer st . .	132.3221
the pert , gray-haired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo , n . y . , is a `` civilian ' ' with the army .	32.359047
her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director .	576.70386
the job also covers a number of other items .	61.01375
`` mom ' ' marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society .	147.11398
her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during may , which is national salvation army week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , mrs . marr ' s office is always open and the welcome mat is out .	146.0457
mrs . marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up .	135.46791
she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures .	205.66656
`` usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men ' ' , mrs . marr explained .	94.05153
the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center .	74.85506
`` and i bum tickets to everything i can ' ' , she said .	12.962037
`` i ' ve become the greatest beggar in the world ' ' .	9.086373
in addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , mrs . marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system .	145.78362
mrs . marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother ' ' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society .	76.69705

the land lies ready for the coming onslaught .	7.4611855
my husband and i , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from tucson , ariz . , to new york city	56.663235
i can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting .	217.56306
i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations .	184.74377
maybe motel-keeping isn ' t the nation ' s biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway .	46.11982
there are motels for all purposes and all tastes .	156.9072
there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock , tex . , as i discovered .	40.284836
there the royal motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free tv , storm cellar ' ' .	77.05678
innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk ' ' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) .	83.83237
some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children .	125.18689
but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar .	158.7897
motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated ' ' signs on farm houses and village homes before world war 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business .	191.35674
at the boxwood motel in winchester , va . , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels .	63.677994
that made up for the `` best ' ' motel in norman , okla . , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8 . 50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture .	189.48346

the baltimore and ohio railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12 01 a . m . next saturday .	117.49604
the current monthly payroll comes to about $15 , 000 , 000 .	4.0966554
howard e . simpson , the railroad ' s president , said , `` a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action ' ' .	100.53338
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b . & o . operates .	29.14692
a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions .	132.16136
there are about 3 , 325 officers and employees in this class .	20.176239
sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense .	52.86185
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a b . & o . spokesman said .	114.182144
those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages .	67.235435
the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job .	91.305824
a thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at franklin and mount streets .	123.91493
the victim , norman b . wiley , 38 , of the 900 block north charles street , was treated for cuts at franklin square hospital after the robbery .	112.10235
the driver told police he followed as the negro man got out of the cab with his money .	46.76369
the victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit .	39.99363
he said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at pennsylvania avenue and gold street .	86.10093
in another attack , samuel verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block aiken street , told police two negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him .	80.61792
a baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room anne arundel county home .	69.867905
the victim darnell somerville , negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at anne arundel general hospital in annapolis .	99.55388
his sister and brother , marie louise , 3 , and john raymond , jr . 22 months , were admitted to the hospital .	53.444534
the girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body .	59.216496
the boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back .	43.19056
police said the children ' s mother , mrs . eleanor somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred .	54.251472
the house is on old annapolis road a mile south of severna park , at jones station , police said .	74.01441
-- the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what .	90.21286
the proposal was made by dr . david s . jenkins after he and mrs . d . ellwood williams , jr . , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week ' s meeting .	52.642292
the disagreement was over what dr . jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting .	123.761696
mrs . williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr . jenkins ' s conversation and how they were written up for the board ' s approval .	83.39296
`` i hate to have these things come up again and again ' ' , dr . jenkins commented as he made his suggestion .	41.115253
`` these are the board ' s minutes .	6.562122
i ' ll write what you tell me to ' ' .	10.684894
for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago .	125.92418
it was about that time , a board member said later , that dr . thomas g . pullen , jr . , state superintendent of schools , told dr . jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him .	68.18404
the board of county commissioners , the sanitary commission , the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings .	252.28249
dr . jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the state do not do so .	52.290054
state senator joseph a . bertorelli ( d . , first baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of west pratt street .	183.25356
he was taken to university hospital in a municipal ambulance .	22.877691
doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side .	29.972176
his condition was said to be , `` fair ' ' .	10.773221
police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 west pratt street .	58.46897
he called vincent l . piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance .	84.10511
the vice president of the city council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies ' ' in the city ' s snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible .	47.96861
councilman william d . schaefer ( d . , fifth ) said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month .	192.66766
conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm , mr . schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here .	120.596176
he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december .	234.51364
equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall ' ' , mr . schaefer said .	35.414364
the councilman , who is the administration floor leader , also criticized bernard l . werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations ' ' on tuesday night after the sunday storm .	110.54877
mr . werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week .	35.408386
what he did , mr . werner said , was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest .	101.96149
mr . schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced ' ' .	107.522896
admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive ' ' .	135.37848
recounting personal observations of clearance work , the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes .	143.82063
-- the 15-year-old adopted son of a washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their chesapeake bay-front home , has been sent to spring grove state hospital for detention .	146.21614
the victims were h . malone dresbach , 47 , and his wife , shirley , 46 .	58.332436
each had been shot in the back several times with a	36.979332
automatic rifle , according to capt . elmer hagner , chief of anne arundel detectives .	30.235136
judge benjamin michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the anne arundel county jail .	46.986156
the circuit court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in juvenile court .	45.252037
soon after 10 a . m . , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the franklin manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the dresbach ' s other son , lee , 14 , they found mrs . dresbach ' s body on the first-floor bedroom floor .	122.46603
her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said .	38.988087
the younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother ' s car .	68.45971
the description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout southern maryland on police radio .	285.74188
police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the dresbachs .	324.69028
trooper j . a . grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a route 2 service station , just outside annapolis .	318.5868
the driver admitted he was the dresbachs ' son and all three were taken to the edgewater station , police said .	93.57757
-- governor tawes today appointed lloyd l . simpkins , his administrative assistant , as maryland ' s secretary of state .	44.474327
mr . simpkins will move into the post being vacated by thomas b . finan , earlier named attorney general to succeed c . ferdinand sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the maryland court of appeals .	107.331215
governor tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next friday .	76.549484
mr . simpkins is a resident of somerset county , and he and the governor , also a somerset countian , have been friends since mr . simpkins was a child .	63.68823
now 38 , mr . simpkins was graduated from the university of maryland ' s college of agriculture in 1947 .	25.545448
five years later , he was awarded the university ' s degree in law .	84.633255
mr . simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the house of delegates from 1951 through 1958 .	34.08862
from the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the house of delegates .	41.938614
maryland contracts for future construction during october totaled $77 , 389 , 000 , up to 10 per cent compared to october , 1960 , f . w . dodge , dodge corporation , reported .	69.52513
nonresidential at $20 , 447 , 000 , down 28 per cent	87.22492
residential at $47 , 101 , 000 , up 100 per cent	23.376049
and heavy engineering at $9 , 841 , 000 , down 45 per cent .	33.802322

residential at $278 , 877 , 000 , up 12 per cent	22.494316
and heavy engineering at $102 , 285 , 000 , down 33 per cent .	36.339172
residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter .	96.79248
the share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time .	102.919525
in 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction .	69.11977
while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field .	153.28612
although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , leo j . pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .	137.15622
`` convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today .	128.90332
trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 ' ' , pantas predicted .	104.97316
sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit harbor view apartments in the cherry hill section .	1071.2429

various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct .	131.91628
others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies .	64.34922
the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction .	60.34365
heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems .	90.26088
construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by johns-manville corporation .	47.70755
-- vital secrets of britain ' s first atomic submarine , the dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire united states navy ' s still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a london-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today .	80.10211
the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in 1959 and was launched last year .	24.72967
it is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs .	115.77536
it has a hull patterned on that of the united states navy ' s nautilus , the world ' s first atomic submarine .	24.590258
its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack .	31.992027
the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow st . police court here at the end of a three day hearing .	140.73946
two british civil servants , miss ethel gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , harry houghton , 55 , and divorced .	66.61147
they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard .	376.92368
gordon a . lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport .	109.37781
when arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in christmas gift wrapping , it was testified .	76.29956
a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger , bookseller , and wife , joyce .	55.69303
( in washington , the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen , an american couple formerly of new york city )	77.87314
in their suburban cottage the crown charges , the krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books .	171.67549
each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript .	100.63012
her young british lawyer , james dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop .	142.44675
`` i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them ' ' , said the magistrate , k . j . p . baraclough .	35.73886
the trial will be held , probably the first week of march , in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs , the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison .	101.04705
fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s .	161.44879
fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior .	239.60916
the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29 , 000 in american and british currency , mostly $20 bills , and in british government bonds and stocks .	68.69345
`` this is russian money ' ' , said mervin griffith-jones for the attorney general ' s office .	55.53302
he asserted that the krogers were the bankers for moscow , lonsdale the red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country ' s secrets .	101.246925
the fact that secrets of the dreadnought , and thereby of the american undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier .	69.63797
but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navy ' s chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , capt . george symonds .	80.26093
he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon , jan . 7 .	93.394844
the information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .	110.10402
just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold .	126.738976
the british defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve .	137.48186
so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour .	122.12919
almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet .	106.927505
britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed .	160.68484
the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack .	359.35516
with the machinery went a complete design for the hull .	30.426107
the skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the nautilus and the other four which preceded it .	154.46896
`` much of the navy ' s future depends upon her ' ' , an american naval announcement said on the skipjack ' s first arrival in british waters in august , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at portland underwater research station .	89.540276
it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work .	123.1483
`` her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent polaris missile submarines ' ' , the statement went on .	66.84971
the atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric corp . .	54.774006
thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said .	74.19307
the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work .	26.824528
it was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the albacore , in 1954 .	91.46391
the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built .	27.127043
reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers .	101.06985
it could , reputedly , go 70 , 000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month .	46.695744
it was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes .	173.2698
the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in miss gee ' s purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future ' ' .	98.17269
the spy ring also was particularly interested in asdic , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified .	84.990234
six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in lonsdale ' s apartment and the krogers ' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid .	118.35011
oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested .	43.103653
the charge that the federal indictment of three chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity ' ' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before judge joseph sam perry in federal district court .	176.48273
the three -- miles j . cooperman , sheldon teller , and richard austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws .	118.32783
in his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , bernard h . sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent ' ' .	78.27749
`` when they became members of the city police narcotics unit ' ' , sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket .	68.572365
they , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers ' ' .	9.06667
although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals ' ' .	115.94109
this , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies ' ' and `` petty personal grievances ' ' .	26.52307
`` in the same five year period that the united states says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy ' ' , sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the lambert tree award and the mayor ' s medal ' ' .	86.40025
in opening , d . arthur connelly , assistant united states attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments .	150.74516
attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients ' guilt .	47.6593
cooperman and teller are accused of selling $4 , 700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , otis sears , 45 , of 6934 indiana av . .	89.01546
among other acts , teller and austin are accused of paying $800 to sears .	91.34254
the first witness , moses winston mardis , 5835 michigan av . , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made .	106.20199
but court adjourned after he testified he introduced james white and jeremiah hope pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced pullings to jessy maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted .	124.438965
buaford robinson , 23 , of 7026 stewart av . , a cta bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st street and south park way .	46.66201
robinson was treated at a physician ' s office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee .	87.728134
his losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck .	166.10353
robinson told policemen james jones and morgan lloyd of the wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of dunbar vocational high school , 30th street and south park way , and began `` skylarking ' ' .	112.000786
when 51st street was reached , robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the cta supervisor .	37.36409

-- a jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old richard pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of mrs . anna hengesbach .	61.934605
he returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last july , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , jack walker , or his guard .	91.80846
the verdict brought vindication to the dead woman ' s stepson , vincent hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in december , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict .	38.517662
mrs . hengesbach was killed on aug . 31 , 1958 .	20.480986
hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since .	120.4768

still , i don ' t wish to appear happy at somebody else ' s misfortune ' ' .	29.637423

hengesbach has been living in grand ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 .	101.4171
pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the westphalia area by state police .	184.1537
however , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial .	136.06863
assistant prosecutor fred lewis , who tried both the hengesbach and pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against pohl .	80.02412
circuit judge paul r . cash did not set a date for sentencing .	77.20621
pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation .	43.590443
walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure .	98.03806
a verdict against pohl came at 4 05 p . m . after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation .	55.642223
the jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of walker after the verdict was announced .	68.75234
the jury foreman , mrs . olive heideman , of rural elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence .	153.37486
she said the jurors agreed that pohl ' s confession was valid .	100.100945
the jury asked judge cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter .	51.06061
some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read .	136.63577
the trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week .	48.62782
a sterling township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends .	158.75769

mrs . pankowski , 61 , remained in holy cross hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while mrs . kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother ' s small upstairs flat at 2274 eight mile road east .	88.49541
assistant fire chief chester cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity .	217.42947
christine ' s twin sister , patricia , and darlene kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns .	80.018394
they are home now with the other kowalski children , vicky , 14	319.40363
`` all we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way mother wanted ' ' , kowalski said in telling his children of their mother ' s death yesterday afternoon .	91.47037
kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills .	184.50897
neighbor women , such as mrs . sidney baker , 2269 serra , sterling township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with kowalski ' s sister-in-law , mrs . anna kowalski , 22111 david , east detroit .	95.71359
another neighbor , mrs . frank c . smith , 2731 pall mall , sterling township , surprised kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs .	227.27145

student council officers announced today the kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for fuhrmann ' s 770 students this friday night .	124.54094
`` furhmann ' s faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for vicky and sympathy for her entire family , pohly said .	143.04784
there also were reports of a collection at the county line elementary school , 3505o dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the kowalski children including christine .	232.85791
kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last saturday .	67.44489
but today he wanted to make a public statement .	114.69891
`` i never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family .	98.18121
i wasn ' t sure there were such people anywhere in the world .	71.88851
i ' ll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them ' ' .	66.71988

the laos government said four major pathet lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from communist north viet nam .	42.306553
the minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60 , 000 communist north vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near thakhek , in southern-central laos .	139.40364
there was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources .	79.40553

a havana radio broadcast identified the americans as howard anderson and august jack mcnair .	67.56116
the executions took place at dawn only a few hours after havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at pinar del rio , where the executions took place .	73.15529
the broadcast said anderson , a seattle ex-marine and havana businessman , and mcnair , of miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to cuban rebels .	91.75466
anderson operated three havana automobile service stations and was commander of the havana american legion post before it disbanded since the start of fidel castro ' s regime .	136.5496
anderson ' s wife and four children live in miami .	43.004585

emory university ' s board of trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state ' s tax laws made such a step possible .	104.03697
`` emory university ' s charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race ' ' , board chairman henry l . bowden stated .	85.597824
but an official statement adopted by the 33-man emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes .	100.49542
the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated .	134.21912
`` emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions ' ' , the statement said .	97.29544
the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation .	37.677223
an emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws .	84.19142
the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people ' ' .	120.46738
at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state .	110.20167
some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation .	88.56287
the student newspaper , the emory wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation .	129.72087
`` from its beginning ' ' , the trustees ' statement said friday , `` emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning .	126.94201
teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under christian influence , are paramount in the emory university policy .	72.2613
`` as a private institution , supported by generous individuals , emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education .	175.77876
`` there is not now , nor has there ever been in emory university ' s charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed .	79.99219
insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , emory university could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed .	49.260483
`` on the other hand , emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia .	38.685123
`` when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education ' ' .	76.57756

the atlanta negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins ' ' if negotiations failed .	234.4412
the demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the committee on appeal for human rights .	99.58337
`` we intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year ' ' , the identically worded letters said .	68.552284
the letters set a nov . 15 deadline for the start of negotiations .	64.263176
they indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate .	552.576
downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted friday night for comment on the coahr request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the friday mail .	69.79425
however , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend .	123.01595
the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday .	86.133286
several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair .	76.311424
student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago .	51.38096
charles a . black , coahr chairman , said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on oct . 31 but had failed to show up .	143.94681
friday ' s letters asked for a nov . 15 meeting .	59.903805
failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference ' ' .	48.570255
black said coahr `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal ' '	108.204285
a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that `` extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits ' '	140.53023
besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and buckhead .	147.2198

but it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , smythe said .	116.961365
no request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however .	86.10483
the commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , roy webster , of hood river , and dr . ennis keizer , of north bend , approved a year ' s contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past .	95.92953
the contract with ray field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month .	108.4633
field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .	106.62507
acting administrator andrew f . juras said that because of field ' s unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period .	122.476074
but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past ' ' .	84.87898
he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave ' ' .	147.22281
juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government .	63.042362
he also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest ' ' in terms of the man ' s responsibility .	62.450996
the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added field ' s long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program .	231.44684
`` do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract ' ' ? ?	91.12158
asked mrs . grace o . peck , representative from multnomah county , of the commission chairman , joseph e . harvey jr . .	64.91434
`` my feeling at the moment ' ' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him .	32.51415
the continued operation of this program depends on having his service ' ' .	123.70458
mrs . peck , later joined by the commission ' s vice-chairman , mrs . lee patterson , took harvey to task for comments he had made to the north portland rotary club tuesday .	95.27159
a publicity release from oregon physicians service , of which harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to salem , instead of `` crippling ' ' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between f & a and the commission staff .	170.98784
`` i rather resent ' ' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in portland as though just the move accomplished this .	218.95139
i think you fell short of the real truth in the matter that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people .	100.68969
the staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles ' ' .	138.1289
harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare ' ' .	58.3182

the target was allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe .	46.321823
the success of the project depended upon fiedler ' s flight .	10.712434
squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket ' s automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude .	143.86063
at 12 , 000 feet , fiedler signaled `` release ' ' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the heinkel .	92.58209
to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m . p . h . .	117.17276
it was probably man ' s first successful flight in a missile .	43.40513
`` she flew beautifully ' ' , said fiedler .	331.89514
`` there was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow .	91.12054
i had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip ' ' .	23.441442
using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket ' s tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage .	166.82712
he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m . p . h . -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield .	157.07407
moments later the v-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed .	161.31189
fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles .	113.03153
the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb .	35.916603
pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships .	201.91707
a crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into allied hands .	42.32988
now a family man with three children , fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale .	139.16827
his spare time is spent in soaring gliders .	3.7307153
`` it ' s so quiet ' ' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging ' ' .	59.13816

members of the san francisco american friends service , a quaker organization , will march to san francisco for a rally in union square at 2 p . m . saturday .	49.865562
in a letter to the american friends service , dr . schweitzer wrote	52.38821
`` leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out .	174.25398
`` they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack .	143.85959
the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons	95.37468
`` governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger	180.32234
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency ' ' .	39.417843
a federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant ' ' and operator of a janitors ' service .	83.86156
before he testified for 20 minutes , stein , who lives at 3300 lake shore dr . , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums .	41.290417
among his gangland buddies , he said , were joseph ( joey ) glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , gus ( slim ) alex , ralph pierce , joe ( caesar ) divarco , and jimmy ( monk ) allegretti .	61.675613
another hoodlum , louis arger , drew $39 , 000 from stein ' s janitor firm , the national maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , stein disclosed in an interview .	98.40849
`` i put arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at navy pier ' ' , stein said .	130.1469
`` but arger never was able to produce it , so i cut him off my payroll ' ' .	76.86261
other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including glimco and alex .	99.947754
the federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing stein ' s fees as a labor consultant .	50.30521
under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to stein ' s national maintenance company at 543 madison st . .	70.97604
the company supplies janitors and workmen for mccormick place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses .	139.59596
among the witnesses were ed j . lee , director of mccormick place	235.83263
jerome leavitt , a partner in the union liquor company , 3247 s . kedzie av . , dominic senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of stein and a cousin of tony accardo , onetime gang chief	84.06478
and frank w . pesce , operator of a glimco dominated deodorant firm , the best sanitation and supply company , 1215 blue island av . .	153.435
lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in april with stein to supply and supervise janitors in mccormick place .	59.07948
stein ' s fee , lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors ' pay .	49.741833
stein estimated this amount at `` about $1 , 500 or $1 , 600 a month ' ' .	39.26136
leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12 , 500 his liquor firm paid to stein for `` labor consultant work ' ' with five unions which organized leavitt ' s workers .	108.60867
leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman ' s local , the teamsters union , a salesman ' s union , the janitors ' union , and a bottling workers ' union .	53.509
government attorneys , leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans ' ' totaling about $40 , 000 which the liquor company made to stein in the last year .	91.69006
all of the loans , in amounts up to $5 , 000 each , have been repaid by stein , according to leavitt .	64.60351
stein said he needed the money , leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll ' ' at national maintenance company .	52.047672
the deodorant firm run by pesce has offices in the headquarters of glimco ' s discredited taxi drivers ' union at 1213-15 blue island av . .	65.02558
the radiation station of the chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over chicago yesterday .	221.40538
the reading , which has been watched with interest since russia ' s detonation of a super bomb monday , was 4 on tuesday and 7 last saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health .	170.96005
the weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week .	193.92238
a board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation .	38.261402
curtis allen huff , 41 , of 1630 lake av . , wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the first federal savings and loan association , 1 s . dearborn st . , where he formerly was employed as an attorney .	115.05995
federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20 , 000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10 , 000 .	51.602955
huff ' s attorney , antone f . gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic ' s liens on property on which the association held mortgages .	148.66432
huff told gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living ' ' .	57.093845
huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from october of 1955 until september of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative .	134.08592
huff lives with his wife , sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25 , 000 home with a $17 , 000 mortgage .	93.632065
the complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by leo blaber , an attorney for the association .	84.12312
the shortage was discovered after huff failed to report for work on sept . 18 .	163.29512
on that date , according to gregorio , huff left his home and took a room in the new lawrence hotel at 1020 lawrence av . .	93.95498
there , gregorio said , huff wrote a complete statement of his offense .	108.9772
later , huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the sherman house , using a credit card .	97.51355
when huff attempted to cash another $100 check there monday , hotel officials called police .	464.009
-- greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay $28 , 700 , 000 to greek victims of nazi persecution , it was announced today .	60.814205
probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week .	120.328674
for many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous .	84.7271
it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock	49.207424
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell .	54.47834
investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many .	246.35825
in fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares .	30.089643
some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers .	30.724688
a measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began .	126.57639
the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12 . 50 a share .	102.70064
the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler , guerin & turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share .	89.44566
and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around $22 a share .	275.6383
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market .	39.474236
indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up .	223.39665
letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185 , 000 to the public at $12 . 50 , with another 5 , 000 reserved for morton foods employes at $11 . 50 a share ) .	70.275604
there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering .	196.30832
`` we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas .	45.52959
cable confirmation ' ' , it said translated .	104.00006
but e . g . t . could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares .	277.46817
after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone .	373.6606
but the result of it all was , e . g . t . partner dean guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation .	73.99112
`` i feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' ' ' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country .	136.12593
he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do .	227.34048
but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one ? ?	278.3056
the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances .	36.67941
first , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up .	104.00974
as a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) .	192.77711
second , the `` potato chip industry ' ' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- frito and h . w . lay -- on the market .	64.01404
both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast run-up .	148.44756
and third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth ' ' industry in the public mind of late .	92.34392
foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant ' ' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios .	146.13362
the potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger .	63.79011
the history of the u . s . potato chip industry is that many of today ' s successful companies got started during the deep depression days .	109.55173
those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest .	143.8926
but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms .	210.81877
so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito .	216.45047
all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is .	119.982956
now , if morton ' s newest product , a corn chip known as chip-o ' s , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to .	144.51129
dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars .	62.24515
more than 10 companies maintain facilities in dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at sherman .	165.01064
it is no coincidence that the texas cotton ginner ' s association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history .	84.67439
the exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the state fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars .	48.07112
it weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year .	248.04562
a modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250 , 000 , and it ' s a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the u . s . and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area .	58.001266
the murray co . of texas , inc . , originated in dallas in 1896 .	42.326496

the company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies .	25.921164
in 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment .	3.3748906
presently , hardwicke-etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the year .	18.529066

factory operations are in columbus , ga . .	38.393024

the john e . mitchell co . began work in dallas in 1928 .	137.85631
the firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment .	113.27736
the increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation .	179.49167
mitchell employs a total of about 400 people .	5.945734
the hinckley gin supply co . is a maker of `` overhead equipment ' ' .	46.900436

new car sales in dallas county during march showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year .	289.22678
registrations of new cars in dallas county cracked the 3 , 000 mark in march for the first time this year .	68.10488
totaling 3 , 399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over february ' s 2 , 963 .	42.167706
however , compared with march 1960 new car sales of 4 , 441 , this march was off 23 per cent .	131.08067
on a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9 , 273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year ' s 3-month total of 11 , 744 .	73.49441
this year-to-year decline for dallas county closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the u . s . for first three months of 1961 were about 1 , 212 , 000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier .	56.705807
with the march pickup , dealers are optimistic that the april-june quarter will equal or top last year .	244.22949
the march gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter .	59.98324
on the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars .	55.573124
only three standard models -- buick , chrysler , and mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in march sales in the county .	139.52313

the kennedy administration ' s new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the federal housing administration , came under fire in dallas last week .	119.7039
the administration ' s proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated caron s . stallard , first vice-president of the mortgage bankers association of america .	111.92188
-- `` the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn ' ' , beryl w . sprinkel , economist of harris trust & savings bank , chicago , predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn . , california group , conference .	141.79886
another speaker , william h . draper , jr . , former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper , gaither & anderson , urged the u . s . to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we won ' t be pushed around any more ' ' .	86.94338
he urged support for president kennedy ' s requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations .	122.96499
sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan ' ' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern .	141.59555
`` in view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial ' ' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 ' ' .	153.67715
sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence ' ' .	119.25877
rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth ' ' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery ' ' .	82.80695
he cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation ' ' .	78.13458
the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 ' ' .	71.08101
the unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike .	191.31622
draper declared , `` as i see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today .	99.54201
we must be ready for any needed sacrifice ' ' .	7.522276
he said that from his experience of two years with gen . clay in west berlin administration , that `` russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we ' re not acting as we should and must ' ' .	153.89648
he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can ' t buy yourself out and that ' s what we ' re trying to do ' ' .	56.83493
while he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro , `` for unless we do we ' re liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere .	90.47115
its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i don ' t believe we can permit that ' ' .	51.5504
-- stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of monday ' s losses in the associated press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks .	171.4582
analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level ' ' represented by around 675 in the dow jones industrial average .	338.2489
it was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages .	201.20844

a $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here tuesday by peter g . peterson , head of one of the world ' s greatest camera firms , in a key address before the american marketing assn . .	163.01527
however , peterson , president of bell & howell , warned 800 u . s . marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom ' ' .	84.09782
`` as we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed ' ' , peterson said .	118.92572
`` with this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically ' ' .	196.52805
the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs .	171.94823
peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas .	229.26059
he cited , as an example , how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology .	107.657005
he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market .	194.96815

this was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the national housing center .	82.40852
other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify ' ' .	145.15343
the poll was taken at the center ' s annual builders ' intentions conference .	427.84708
expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 .	131.28973
look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960 ' s 1 , 257 , 700 non-farm housing starts .	45.484665
the industry has said 1960 was a poor year .	144.7778
why the discrepancy between the builders ' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ?	76.37258
the reason , says the housing center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders ' ' .	116.35037
-- farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales `` we ' ve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for 10 more .	190.77065
we sold only four pickers all last year ' ' .	4.451129
gus ehlers , competitor of mr . houtz in this farm community , says his business since august 1 is running 50% above a year earlier .	168.77924
`` before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% ' ' , he says .	82.456276
though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas .	127.41765
paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output .	301.47635
although the administration ' s program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines .	105.87929
fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently .	158.36398
the higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery .	91.06185
seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year .	193.47322
`` in august our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were 14% higher than last year ' ' , says mark v . keeler , farm equipment vice president of international harvester co . .	69.16135
for the year to date , sales of the company ' s farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 .	114.53451
among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% .	123.57589
not all sections are showing an upswing , however	218.79462
the drought-seared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend .	132.4596
the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry .	56.418457
the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally .	92.38585
farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products .	80.62603
more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation ' s trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products .	92.58086
farmers are so eager for new machinery that they ' re haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report .	205.73415
`` farmers aren ' t as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale ' ' , says jack martin , who sells j . i . case tractors and implements in sioux city , iowa .	118.130165
`` this morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2 , 700 model .	152.78362
last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine ' ' .	34.901325
in august of 1960 , he sold seven .	33.682407
with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country ' s farm equipment manufacturers .	53.95771
for example , farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about 5% above a year earlier , mr . keeler reports .	75.02236
tractor production at massey-ferguson , ltd . , of toronto in july and august rose to 2 , 418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says john staiger , vice president .	82.04247
with the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements .	215.33292
merritt d . hill , ford motor co . vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers .	268.40878
except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 .	222.42567
the rise in sales last winter was checked when the government ' s new feed grain program was adopted	293.4587
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines .	152.45789
nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects .	166.71246
total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the july 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 .	219.83182
the government also is aiding farmers ' income prospects .	21.175533
agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers $1 . 4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1 . 1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 .	145.62936
price support loans may total another $1 billion this year .	42.350105
with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers ' gross income is estimated at $39 . 5 billion , $1 . 5 billion above 1960 ' s record high .	62.739685
net income may reach $12 . 7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 .	98.63972
the government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-september for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-july .	269.742
kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling .	22.038671
the supreme court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined .	109.255356
the company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products .	87.0862
such `` depletion allowances ' ' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets .	171.4546
the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products .	100.43631
a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the ruling ' s impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products .	228.3782
the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone .	83.81634
president kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception .	171.55421
`` my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries ' ' , the president said .	59.032646
charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the i . r . s . .	56.740154
the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution .	114.647675
requests for substantiation , the service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show .	302.21918
in such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received .	47.180225
a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested .	102.32068
a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax , under federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation .	116.79484
louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale .	31.071129
the corporation , in filing its final federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under u . s . tax law .	118.060905
the revenue service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income .	265.7679
it said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations .	176.66737
the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a year-old i . r . s . ruling on the subject .	132.99852
the service has not said what its next step will be .	83.89587
peace corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency .	56.372875
it provides that the $1 , 800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received .	208.67775
the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back ' ' to the company ' s advertising manager , the tax court ruled .	93.42388
the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager .	157.51117
the court upheld the taxpayer ' s contention that these `` kickbacks ' ' were not his income though they passed through his hands .	124.3195
the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting `` it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction ' ' .	92.375496
a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel .	156.30391
the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal manufacturers ' excise tax on household-type appliances .	225.43936
hiring the wife for one ' s company may win her tax-aided retirement income .	152.5143
a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company ' s pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage .	49.47782
she would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company ' s contributions would be tax-free .	49.71734
a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income .	153.21588
in that event , they note , the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law .	269.33792
possible upshots the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made .	101.78389
state briefs voters in four counties containing and bordering denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area .	234.77414
denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax .	52.35812
the washington state supreme court ruled that the state ' s occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent .	113.07854
the state ' s occupation tax is computed on gross sales .	35.166973
the court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities .	287.57065
-- consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months , the government reported .	133.20192
the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in april , down 1% from the march level of more than $18 . 2 billion .	103.17843
april sales also were 5% below those of april last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18 . 9 billion ( see chart on page one ) .	166.77225
the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-easter buying was pushed into march .	162.66881
commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march .	216.651
adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2 . 5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the january low of $17 . 8 billion .	85.77859

use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest .	11.722467
dip in melted butter and roll in flour .	18.91091
place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan .	24.2272
bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 f . until lightly brown .	235.26518
add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken breasts .	39.081444

contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability .	228.50926
that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month .	114.84596
though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the ' 20 ' s and ' 40 ' s , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary .	141.0483
these two , heritage and drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone .	217.08792
the heritage collection , to be shown by sanger-harris and anderson ' s studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time .	152.41507
called perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces .	192.11961
walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors .	88.12346
it is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality .	154.84198
the drexel collection , called composite , to be shown by titche ' s offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs .	104.7049
rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia .	94.55205
a high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest .	119.03119
an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard .	95.44174
the other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror .	56.246704
colorful , bright eastman chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite .	62.03255
the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles .	38.74535
design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexel ' s fall 1961 group , composite .	524.3155
the spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top .	169.09639
see-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor .	94.64136
to bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics .	45.43485
dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today ' s design , with substance and maturity , keynote the perennian collection from heritage .	140.06229
center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases .	56.668907
mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile .	114.66883
the vagabonds are `` on the road ' ' again .	34.02604
members are on their way to saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars .	250.55495

their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to europe .	59.31931
in the past , the men and women have chartered planes to las vegas and jamaica , buses to mineral wells and kerrville and private railway coaches to shreveport and galveston .	68.66418
two of these are in or near dallas and the others away from the vicinity .	87.28534
serving on the club ' s board are mmes r . p . anderson , president	100.1063
w . h . roquemore , treasurer , and the following chairmen mmes mckee , publicity	55.13108
lawrence b . jones , yearbook , and sam laughlin , scrapbook .	537.7889
a cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25 , 000 for a minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual pillsbury bake-off tuesday .	107.01866

she dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest .	190.02943
the second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist .	83.49614
the third time was on the floor of the beverly hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges .	65.05127

guests from across u . s . honor dr . swim	38.98351
when dr . w . a . swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the wilshire country club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country .	114.56002
a flight originating in florida picked up guests on the east coast and midwest and a plane left from seattle taking on passengers at west coast points .	139.7784
cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known dr . swim when he practiced in los angeles .	53.23508
he started practice in 1917 , and served on the state board of medical examiners .	139.11844
giving up the violin opened a whole new career for ilona schmidl-seeberg , a tiny hungarian who fritz kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage .	139.5678
a heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing .	166.84822
she put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in budapest .	173.10185
now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in los angeles .	78.850426
her days as an art student at the university of budapest came to a sudden end during the hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband stephen fled to vienna .	70.36446
there they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture .	82.52397
and there she had her first showing of tapestry work .	213.2045
there ' s a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today .	49.38266
what most people don ' t seem to realize , if they aren ' t tied up with the thing as i am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation .	100.98559
i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school .	200.95384
it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school .	97.5943
getting to and from school was no problem .	10.998356
now they go to a high school that is two miles away .	54.922825
one might think the problem would be similar .	6.2166557
they could walk , ride on a bus or be driven .	43.318455
it ' s much more complex than that .	159.94478
generally , they go to school with a girl named gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car .	45.724506
this is a way of getting to school , but , i understand , it entails a certain loss of social status .	49.86284
a young man doesn ' t like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn ' t even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl .	69.13757
`` why don ' t you walk to school then ' ' ? ?	56.830757
`` my father walked , through two miles of snow , in illinois ' ' .	31.123316
`` no ' ' , i said , `` i didn ' t happen to grow up in illinois ' ' .	18.518007
i explained , however , that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom .	87.212944
i had to ride a streetcar two miles .	8.643111
sometimes there weren ' t even any seats .	6.277814
i had to stand up , with the ladies .	88.8577
sometimes i got on the wrong car and didn ' t get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there .	56.199734
i ' ve tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then .	105.97656
when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car .	59.10833
she has to have at least one car herself .	126.33598
i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman .	83.616425
if they have to take any car , they ' d rather take the big one .	283.06448
they say that when they take a car , gloriana doesn ' t take her car , but rides with them .	46.208115
but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn ' t big enough .	93.36443
the logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself .	103.81323
the solution , naturally , is the bus .	17.616545
however , it ' s a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it ' s too hard on my legs .	63.522327
my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there .	232.81639
nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman , and he ' s already got an education .	123.255455
advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the new york social register which made news last week .	186.02838
published annually by william hord richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled society register of southern california , is scheduled to arrive with monday morning ' s postman .	236.96866
publisher richardson has updated the blue book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages ' ' .	176.52759
stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year .	19.998178
last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of meredith jane cooper , daughter of the grant b . coopers , to robert knox worrell , and of mary alice ghormley to willard pen tudor .	135.12733
others are carla ruth craig to dan mcfarland chandler jr .	18.87733
joanne curry , daughter of the ellsworth currys , to james hartley gregg , and valerie smith to james mcalister duque .	236.16707
also noted are the marriages of elizabeth browning , daughter of the george l . brownings , to austin c . smith jr .	47.530304
cynthia flower , daughter of the ludlow flowers jr . , to todd huntington , son of the david huntingtons .	50.330334
listed as newly wed in the pasadena section of the new book are mr . and mrs . samuel moody haskins 3 .	48.82049
she is the former judy chapman , daughter of john s . chapman of this city .	61.278637
another marriage of note is that of jane mcalester and william louis pfau .	71.50663
for instance , the edwin pauleys jr . , formerly of chantilly rd . , are now at home on north arden dr . in beverly hills .	65.375755
mr . and mrs . robert moulton now live on wilshire and the franklin moultons on s . windsor blvd . .	87.256004
the richard beesemyers , formerly of connecticut , have returned to southern california and are now residing on south arden blvd . .	84.67233
but the raoul esnards have exchanged their residence in southern california for mexico city .	38.717407
judge and mrs . julian hazard are now at laguna beach , while the frank wangemans have moved from beverly hills to new york , where he is general manager of the waldorf-astoria hotel .	46.150444
and lawrence chase , son of the ransom chases , is listed at his new address in oxford , eng . .	54.62088
others listed at new addresses are the richard t . olerichs , the joseph aderholds jr . , the henri de la chapelles , the john berteros and dr . and mrs . egerton crispin , the john armisteads , the allen chases , the howard lockies , the thomas lockies , and anthony longinotti .	61.05106
newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the ray carbones , formerly of panama	170.4027
the geddes macgregors , formerly of scotland , and mr . and mrs . werner h . althaus , formerly of switzerland .	40.807148
here ' s an idea for a child ' s room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases .	85.6886
most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes .	86.54932
displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent .	179.43312
to create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop .	88.934044
measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet ' s head .	56.66939
make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` l ' ' , the foot of the `` l ' ' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light .	68.50422
using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base .	50.73933
in this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal .	99.08974
if the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child ' s whims .	85.96006
although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child ' s playtime .	83.92984
those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round .	42.493565
today ' s trend toward furniture designs from america ' s past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era .	68.276825
a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions .	42.230164
in the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch .	194.83098
so junior ' s bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks ' ' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only .	135.47418
this isn ' t true of the many homemakers of the 1960 ' s , according to decorator consultant , leland alden .	86.46933
housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says mr . alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical ' ' .	159.03575
there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop `` down to earth ' ' designs -- or go out of business .	100.43564
hotel escape ' s bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` kings 4 , plus two ' ' .	205.10962
this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch .	232.98398
show spotlights the kings -- george worth , bill kay , frank ciciulla and gene wilson , flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens .	68.18888
the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid .	66.151146
in the comedy division , the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props .	145.73189
net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick .	173.69168
kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs .	44.581284

newcomers are ernie kemm on piano , wes robbins , bass and trumpet , and jack kelly on drums .	45.26134
it ' s a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by ernie , it ' s al ' s all the way .	63.101128

is there anything a frustrated individual can do about communism ' s growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ?	108.64825
more than 300 teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from 4 to 8 p . m . sunday at first presbyterian church .	70.090004
at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged .	129.78108
a young real estate salesman , kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force .	152.75113
he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing .	271.60367
kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it .	120.65761
when he attended the christian anti-communist crusade school here about six months ago , jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it .	114.73649
the best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church .	189.37381
and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a biblically strong christianity .	260.48264

until that first dedication service , he and lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home .	134.31477
they have five daughters -- coral lee , 5 , glenda rae , 4 , pamela , 3 , karen , 2 , and shari , five months .	85.818474
but after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and bible stories .	174.85568
to their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part .	60.272156
even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her .	204.00565

enrique jorda , conductor and musical director of the san francisco symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in europe before returning home to open the symphony ' s golden anniversary season , it was announced .	61.111
the guest assignments are scheduled for november 14 and 18 , with the orchestra sinfonica siciliana in palermo and the orchestra of radio cologne .	58.823616
the season in san francisco will open with a special gala concert on november 22 .	35.98181
during his five-month visit abroad , jorda recently conducted the orchestre philharmonique de bordeau in france , and the santa cecilia orchestra in rome .	61.53106
in announcing jorda ' s return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the sherman clay box office on wednesday .	136.93587
guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists yehudi menuhin , isaac stern , ruggiero ricci and david abel	59.143433
pianists leon fleisher , ruth slenczynka and stephen bishop and conductor earl bernard murray .	76.51171
the leningrad kirov ballet , which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house , is , i think , the finest `` classical ' ' ballet company i have ever seen , and the production of the petipa-tschaikowsky `` sleeping beauty ' ' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing .	96.16375
i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect	90.86935
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was	152.60909
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people	46.166588
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms .	75.467224
all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirov ' s utterly captivating presentation .	39.801388
the reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova ' ' , `` eva ' ' , or `` aya ' ' .	38.802223
in other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet .	298.2091
it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- miss omsk , miss pinsk , miss stalingr oops , skip it .	127.18898
these qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company ' s collective personality .	139.18387
it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet .	158.89447
oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the kirov .	73.940125
this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics .	286.71735
but , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned .	83.64131
irina kolpakova , the princess aurora of friday ' s performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before .	70.986946
she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable .	77.2945
alla sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the east , was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner , yuri soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky .	150.98038
vladilen semenov , a fine `` danseur noble ' '	3.7387984
and inna zubkovskaya , an excellent lilac fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent .	64.16957
the production , designed by simon virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way .	264.81436
it was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery .	148.30513
evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , guy lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity .	197.25397
mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the san francisco chamber music society .	106.014175

sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season	2204.5566
participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in the chronicle ) .	209.51428
mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 chestnut street , san francisco 9 .	77.07636
san francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children .	122.10613
fire fighters local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for san franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen .	80.8981
toys will not be collected at firehouses this year .	18.081964
they will be accepted at all branches of the bay view federal savings and loan association , at a collection center in the center of the stonestown mall , and at the junior museum , 16th street and roosevelt way .	87.91696
from the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution .	95.04399
any needy family living in san francisco can obtain toys by writing to christmas toys , 676 howard street , san francisco 5 , and listing the parent ' s name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 .	63.41411
requests must be mailed in by december 5 .	6.4117403
famed cellist pablo casals took his instrument to the east room of the white house yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal .	106.18269
he was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for puerto rico governor luis munoz marin .	72.41351
president kennedy ' s invitation to the spanish-born master said , `` we feel your performance as one of the world ' s greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests ' ' .	84.75061
for a good many seasons i ' ve been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies .	80.165085
after all , this year ' s movies are next year ' s television shows .	90.70156
so i went to see `` la dolce vita ' ' .	2.6088884
it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality .	29.824825
all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film .	162.39655
if that ' s all the romans did , it ' s a surprise to me that rome fell .	67.1294
after television , `` la dolce vita ' ' seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night .	80.94321
i cannot imagine a single scene that isn ' t done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week .	148.84058
`` la dolce vita ' ' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western .	223.59659
week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` the adventures of ozzie and harriet ' ' .	69.78646
there is more decadence on `` 77 sunset strip ' ' .	15.115168
there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series .	1879.1229
in another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns .	141.15541
with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you ' ll find on the robert herridge theater .	109.75617
most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party ' ' at a seaside villa .	103.99501
producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! !	89.90839
the dolce vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip )	186.16982
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face	140.14899
a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies .	5.72849
put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word i can think of dull .	93.35423
apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall .	83.20485
what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! !	383.41888
as a moral shocker it is a dud .	39.399956
but this doesn ' t detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film .	144.03564
the chronicle ' s paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly	834.65924
`` this is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories ' ' .	182.55722
and when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .	50.64467
tonight atlantic monthly editor edward weeks moderates a round table of four russian writers in a discussion of soviet literature .	150.74069

nbc plans a new series of three long programs exploring america ' s scientific plans titled `` threshold ' ' , to start in the fall .	54.41255
`` science in action ' ' , san francisco ' s venerable television program , will be seen in hong kong this fall in four languages mandarin , cantonese , chiuchow and english , according to a tip from dr . robert c . miller .	77.2728
it is very chic to drive foreign cars .	9.598078
with a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back .	67.124695
the wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive .	384.58163
but we couldn ' t really get along without it .	42.379925
`` where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha ' ' ? ?	38.18815
the present crop of small cars is enriching american humor .	266.10184
gas station people are very debonair about small cars .	99.11247
when i drove a car with tail fins , i had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases .	271.24374
my car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth .	50.68329
when i had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me .	111.01971
check the oil and water , sir ? ?	1.2299192
the man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank .	10.990568
`` what kind of car is it ' ' ? ?	2.5414255
`` it is a british austin , the smallest they make ' ' .	194.92334
`` what i always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ?	66.1514
crunch , that ' s all she wrote ' ' .	4.4211154
`` that will be $1 . 80 ' ' , said the gas station man .	71.04848
`` the windshield looks pretty clean ' ' .	3.731358
ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! !	1.0844837
when i wheeled about , finned fore and aft , i was the darling of the doormen .	57.846897
dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely .	269.37582
with a small bomb , i tuck it between cadillacs .	274.4671
( the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself .	632.4509
high blood pressure can get the best of any of us .	56.11161
at last the white house is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master american craftsman , duncan phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u . s . presidents of the 19th century sent abroad for their furnishings .	98.024216
the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansion ' s library .	66.1673
the suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 ' s .	41.392414
the gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey , whose famous estate , `` tranquility ' ' , was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover , n . j . .	50.480373
authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago .	282.96246
this acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs .	173.19026
the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedy ' s fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home .	68.62054
it is the aid ' s intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of americana ' ' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall .	152.47163
the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture .	72.99399
the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem , mass . , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in 1792 .	94.25316
the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace .	30.49204
it will be painted to match the paneling in the room .	42.065044
the aid committee ' s chairman in charge of the redecoration , mrs . henry francis lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project .	69.062775
mrs . lenygon ' s committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york , include mrs . allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j . jussel , both wellknown manhattan decorators .	134.46196
regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e . barnes of boston .	85.77298
president kennedy couldn ' t stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people ' s concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the 85-piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard , n . c . .	91.19265
but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music .	311.44147
at 4 p . m . the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert .	112.77596
it was the first in the series of `` concerts for young people by young people ' ' to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house .	53.328667
she was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience .	111.497284
she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port , mass . , and in his welcoming remarks , the president said he was representing her .	94.41927
as he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion , the band struck up the `` star spangled banner ' ' and followed it with `` hail to the chief ' ' .	50.6849
`` i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band , and we are grateful to them ' ' , president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl .	109.89704
after paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , president kennedy said , `` as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music ' ' .	70.742935
he added `` i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field ' ' .	55.148933
displaying his knowledge of music , the new england-born president remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont , by young americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the united states .	95.72144
`` this is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as i do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the white house ' ' .	67.24916
as he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests .	79.32757
he expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde patricia holbrook , 16 , of mount rainier , had attended the joseph p . kennedy school for the handicapped in boston .	99.57115
`` the nuns there do a wonderful work ' ' , the president commented .	17.217503
patricia now attends the c . melvin sharpe health school in the district .	126.14937
each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon .	90.675354
they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff .	70.84691
many of the music-loving members of the president ' s staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience .	38.80164
and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected .	577.4689
henry hall wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the president ' s staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives , turned guest conductor for a sousa march , the `` stars and stripes forever ' ' .	52.63934
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs . kennedy ' s social secretary , letitia baldrige , told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring .	70.83573
he said he contacted a friend , henry hall wilson , on the president ' s staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series .	55.79159
a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student north carolina group to play the first concert .	104.16558
one of the most interested `` students ' ' on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house , was letitia baldrige , social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy .	75.5726
`` i was an art major in college ' ' , miss baldrige explained .	52.35462
`` i ' ve been here so many times i couldn ' t count them ' ' .	25.23314
she turned out to be a fan , too , of margaret bouton , the gallery ' s associate curator of education .	91.02799
miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at 5 p . m . .	44.067757
the brevard group of 85 arrived at the gallery at 6 p . m . , remaining for about 45 minutes .	63.676384
the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later .	139.65274
they decided that they thought rembrandt ' s self-portrait made him look `` sad ' '	169.83908
they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphael ' s `` alba madonna ' ' and `` texture ' ' in a monet painting of rheims cathedral .	28.158457
everybody had heard of van gogh , the french impressionist .	167.89105
gallery director john walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them .	125.0746
he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , richard bales .	154.14941
i ' m sure you ' ve heard of him and his record , ' the confederacy ' ' ' .	95.564064
along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the gallery ' s blue-uniformed guards .	122.600006
in 45 minutes , the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late 19th century .	110.55931
a few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art ' ' .	10.047125
among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were boucher , courbet , fra angelico .	87.357666
the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallery ' s rotunda fountain `` because it ' s on the second floor ' ' .	46.551765
that imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st . nw . took on bustling life yesterday .	246.78436
more than 250 scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , albert pike , who headed the scottish rite from 1859 to 1891 .	42.310978
they came together in the huge , high-ceilinged council chamber to hear the late leader eulogized .	400.80438
c . wheeler barnes of denver , head of the scottish rite in colorado , praised pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order .	79.02557
the ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of pike in the house of the temple .	56.71716
about 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the ancient and accepted scottish rite for the southern jurisdiction of the united states .	64.83014
the opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a . m . today .	38.15331
there will be a pilgrimage to mount vernon at 2 30 p . m . .	18.15404
a wreath will be placed at the tomb of george washington , one of this nation ' s first masons -- a past master of washington-alexandria lodge 22 in alexandria .	78.44777
the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years .	304.41022
john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous .	59.89432
he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife .	127.35629
hurt by his lack of interest and attention , mary complained often that he didn ' t help around the house , and that he didn ' t really care about the family .	40.520702
he in turn told her she demanded too much .	6.4843535
they were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable .	16.505695
without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done .	66.89199
the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer .	180.23302
family service , sharing in ugf , has five agencies in the washington area .	152.02696
they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems .	167.67776
because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , mr . and mrs . black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia , the agency nearest them .	79.43825
for nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce .	87.20035
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other .	67.563156

one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev .	55.252377
`` i ' m hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground ' ' .	228.70143
the president knew that a confrontation with mr . khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable .	93.58894
but he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting .	148.10725
he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u . s . and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy .	38.451508
president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s . khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4 .	119.58199
the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relations .	47.62435
the heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the president ' s change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader .	26.952272
he was not going to vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned .	76.20132
but mr . kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr . khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe .	47.613758
that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting .	48.91502
despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war .	58.195133
the u . s . and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations ' ' .	142.24603
the first time was in 1955 when a full-dress big four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of geneva ' ' .	63.987946
the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east .	84.091446
in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u . s . .	20.848997
that meeting produced the `` spirit of camp david ' ' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement .	134.34935
on the third occasion -- another big four summit session at paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit ' ' .	82.45348
premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u . s . for the u-2 incident .	18.310135
the episode tended to confirm the u . s . belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the soviet leader ' s real aims in summitry .	74.58787
thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president , mr . kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem .	48.05352
shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words	77.3153
`` as long as mr . khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations ' ' .	157.31992
the president had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the u . s . and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance .	116.13243
he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary .	271.95813
he wanted time , too , to review the united states ' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating .	165.64163
above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev ' s doorstep .	56.694477
at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader .	64.37632
ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels .	128.91629
but mr . kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it .	118.59151
it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe mr . khrushchev ' s intentions and to make clear his own views .	56.40891
moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u . s . was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions .	73.35121
both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e . thompson brought back to russia late in february .	134.33142
the letter , dated feb . 22 , was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk , siberia , on march 9 .	94.76211
it dealt mainly with a broad range of east-west issues .	105.65949
but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr . khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted .	35.984573
developments over the next two months , however , caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing .	82.912125
there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly .	86.03616
the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva .	49.35775
the deadlock has been caused by the russians ' new demand for a three-man ( east , west and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery .	178.2153
in the u . s . , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing .	131.67136
mr . kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament .	115.14844
there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to communist china .	84.83968
the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent .	114.14338
moreover , moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the u . n . secretariat and the international control commission for laos .	66.657585
mr . kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible .	188.68391
developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting .	58.496273
initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting .	120.867676
at the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the west ' s ability and determination to resist communist pressure .	67.81727
in cuba , the u . s . had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep .	122.87302
in laos , the picture was almost equally bad .	48.971252
u . s . willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized ' ' on soviet terms .	111.73316
beyond that , allied disagreement about military intervention in laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces .	176.0387
as a result , the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos , and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure .	91.26012
in the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself .	75.436
ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leader ' s mood was cocky and aggressive .	32.92146
he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out .	88.42214
the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin , iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back .	83.58325
it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the u . s . embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future .	60.796135
mr . kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies .	194.54846
the response from london , paris and bonn was favorable .	41.855595
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week .	83.50188
apparently at the insistence of the u . s . , the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the `` informal ' ' nature of the meeting .	68.74831
`` the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries .	73.01231
the meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries ' ' .	61.24239
the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in mr . kennedy ' s own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident ' ' , and a 44-year-old president ( his birthday is may 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy .	130.1021
the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u . s . of both approval and disapproval .	57.36045
the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at vienna .	87.23091
the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations .	23.13679
but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary .	168.83397
mr . khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men .	109.01062
the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr . kennedy would give him pause .	79.11881
apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the u . s . appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit .	80.57438
premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway .	255.54034
this time the initiative came , in part at least , from washington .	69.02172
there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr . khrushchev , the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders .	83.51211
thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity .	249.27663
finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president ' s making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord .	47.37353
there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world .	70.53377
if tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the u . s . make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union .	53.620716
disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .	98.42186
after cuba and laos , it was argued , mr . khrushchev will interpret the president ' s consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds .	144.4854
moreover , the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of america ' s firm foreign policy commitments .	76.37673
the question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the president would take if mr . khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east .	81.93754
there are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory .	129.85368
the shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development .	88.49604
though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education .	83.21985
there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities .	99.26983
the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .	83.28511
by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence .	170.21228
there is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture .	115.11955
viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university .	182.37051
but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project	593.17303
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy .	58.253162
official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds .	164.39076
american catholics have responded generously to bishops ' and pastors ' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning .	82.44421
they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made .	225.46161
diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility .	235.59682
all of this may be understandable enough it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise .	90.690796
yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities .	160.67564
community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible .	253.47215
to understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of american catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community .	62.24313
it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment .	88.59708
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere .	110.58751
the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension .	129.98447
the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship .	59.930862
american catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise ' ' -- the `` private enterprise ' ' of religious communities .	26.898977
had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees .	87.34896
there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business ' ' .	73.17751
this `` family-community ' ' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement .	68.63657
it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas .	55.28991
i think for example of three women ' s colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university , which is also co-educational .	91.99211
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough .	447.65784
it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot .	491.25662
apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business ' ' spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny .	54.7668
for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today ' s need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence ' ' .	121.2457
at the earlier `` pre-academic excellence ' ' stage of catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis .	146.99352
but with today ' s demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders ' ' becomes more pressing .	80.72427
the problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers ' ' are needed but that a different brand is called for .	202.66327
commenting on the earlier stage , the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee ' ' ( as opposed to , e . g . , `` maintenance employee ' ' ) was a not inapt description .	58.11222
today however , the `` outsider ' ' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university .	121.32968
and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement .	167.63164
in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it `` even with the best of intentions he ( the president of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities .	85.011185
it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' ' ' .	138.36261
the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns ' ' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside ' ' faculty .	89.599045
it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university ' ' this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension .	90.225075
but in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one .	91.347664
`` outside ' ' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business .	91.98535
there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university .	54.234276
in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel .	94.71964
word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences .	114.412895
expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype .	197.34935
in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere .	170.4327
to appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service .	156.81445
much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure .	258.3464
this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated .	89.799126
when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services .	81.92465
a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family ' ' .	96.25766
just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions .	92.31147
yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place .	129.11284
broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university .	67.209854
religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman ' s reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification .	124.264336
there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels .	109.925606
the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution .	80.922485
but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation .	83.27618
the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group ' ' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself .	60.977104
this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure .	265.80734
yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order .	74.80064
the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority .	161.26859
in the case of academic personnel the `` feeling ' ' of participation can hardly be `` faked ' ' .	38.85806
competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students ' illusion that they are making their own decisions .	202.2469
those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work ' ' and ersatz decision making .	181.9442
in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all .	249.73694
in the notre dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication ' ' .	75.5289
in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation ' ' the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i . e . , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements .	77.6477
sen . john l . mcclellan of arkansas and rep . david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws .	164.77414
once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally .	145.80127
or , in the words of anatole france , `` the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges ' ' .	128.58807
the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr . mcclellan ' s hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites .	126.127304
the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .	172.71632
in addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill .	207.9439
it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike .	110.11562
business week ( aug . 9 , 1961 ) reports that the united aircraft company , against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .	123.57365
the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers .	173.85004
the company has billed the united states government for $7 , 500 , 000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor ' s business .	69.717445
rep . frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee .	67.84671
neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter	72.57692
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions .	16.48443
the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained .	97.08999
the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines	218.47394
it must play a game in which there never is a winner .	139.98543
the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law .	171.29689
hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy .	94.93402
let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which general electric , westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market .	95.3284
the industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied .	139.83638
the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment .	45.93106
accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price .	175.96309
naturally , enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .	104.65553
should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry .	71.20625
uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition ' ' .	38.369217
but if they show self-restraint , they don ' t get the orders .	23.43387
under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted .	103.48954
engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants .	93.05699
the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that general electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows .	81.09442
in other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday , wednesday and friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday , thursday and saturday .	78.35497
and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday ? ?	67.87308
the question might be asked `` don ' t the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ?	113.48626
why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws ' ' ? ?	130.58209
the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold , in the folklore of capitalism , back in 1937 .	206.52913
he wrote `` ( p . 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure .	60.815826
( p . 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship .	199.77089
( p . 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control .	96.2661
in this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws .	96.674126
( pp . 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government ' ' .	61.083176
this escape from control has led to management ' s evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while .	113.82433
a plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license .	141.59029
( the penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities .	190.15271
if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest .	136.00214
a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle .	32.228714
however , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational .	80.91871
quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union .	68.377365
those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform .	130.40009
before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english .	108.77386
the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle .	101.53337
the wagner act , the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .	54.37832
the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .	83.64183
if a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud .	94.8272
the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession .	78.54051
if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them .	108.32607
human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century america .	101.31796
as early as 1776 , adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations `` we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work	132.39
but many against combining to raise it ' ' .	3.9929297
eighteenth-century england , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies .	69.90056
in 1825 , the boston house carpenters ' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared `` it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies ' ' .	108.24872
there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly .	142.47379
the courts shared the opinion of the employers .	6.6572127
in people vs . fisher , justice savage of the new york supreme court declared	59.833836
`` without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it	86.04327
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means ' ' .	95.300766
compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin , according to the daily labor report of sept . 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment ' ' .	75.76159
senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .	83.06963
his bill , allegedly aimed at hoffa , would amend the sherman , clayton and norris-laguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international .	111.01261
paradoxically , the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act .	91.891235
indeed , it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws	158.37924
for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers .	119.633835
at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates .	72.29583
the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies .	33.949226
in the famous danbury hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices , e . g . , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer .	93.73959
the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .	312.461
in 1914 , the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity .	92.526535
labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws .	225.6931
the courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act .	160.01671
in 1922 , the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company .	51.128624
the company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union ' s activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce .	56.84756
( what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ?	206.48384
) the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce .	122.038025
at a closed-door session on capitol hill last week , secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on u . s . affairs abroad .	118.06456
afterward , tennessee ' s democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen .	216.48268
what herter presented , said gore , was `` not a very encouraging review ' ' .	69.025734
that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts .	83.08135
while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos , two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions .	136.60782
hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery , dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the u . s . with a blunt and drastic demand within 48 hours , the u . s . had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 u . s . citizens , plus 120 cuban employees ) .	84.73405
president eisenhower held an 8 30 a . m . meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately .	84.50011
`` there is a limit to what the united states in self-respect can endure ' ' , said the president .	31.39437
`` that limit has now been reached ' ' .	1.5306119
through secretary herter , ike offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision .	138.06537
kennedy , through secretary-designate of state dean rusk , declined .	52.44152
he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan . 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the u . s . and latin america ( see the hemisphere ) .	65.87204
after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants , the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam .	83.059326
`` in view of the present situation in laos ' ' , said the pentagon ' s announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific ' ' .	55.151066
cutting short a holiday at hong kong , the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines .	90.19995
on the u . s . ' s island base of okinawa , task force 116 , made up of army , navy , marine and air force units , got braced to move southward on signal .	214.47908
but by week ' s end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the u . s . was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-western -- government might be best for laos .	98.06962
there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts .	307.76642
political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right .	165.95447
`` it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again ' ' , said one military man .	138.5369
but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground ? ?	105.775635
at geneva in 1954 , to get the war in indo-china settled , the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state , north viet nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos .	104.87029
the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west .	140.09467
he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj .	78.778725
`` the important thing from now on ' ' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia ' ' .	56.0573
russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana , russian intrigue in the congo , and russian arms drops in laos ( using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time .	94.89469
soviet premier khrushchev sent new year ' s hopes for peace to president-elect kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply .	56.390514
considering the state of the whole world , the cold war ' s three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous	74.84445
but , in senator gore ' s words , it was `` not a very encouraging ' ' situation that would confront john f . kennedy on inauguration day .	79.88793
as the 87th congress began its sessions last week , liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor .	68.98914
the liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost .	533.2423
this time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable .	70.61841
they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck .	127.10071
and counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will .	186.90872
there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely mississippi ' s 14-term william meyers colmer ( pronounced calmer ) .	126.80928
caucusing , the liberals decided to go after colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the house is next to godliness .	178.48882
a dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative .	118.30277
he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents .	153.13065
he is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-negro ' ' speech .	67.66468
for 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee .	28.698235
there his vote , along with those of chairman howard smith , the courtly virginia judge , and the four republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the rayburn-johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) .	176.1073
there was sufficient pretext to demand colmer ' s ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi .	186.74774
reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons .	87.92321
in 1949 the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry truman , and in 1957 , after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage .	110.10806
( in the heat of the anti-colmer drive last week , judge smith threatened reprisal against powell .	69.7649
said he `` we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here ' ' .	86.35454
) but speaker sam rayburn , after huddling in palm beach with president-elect kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective .	70.23263
in a tense , closed-door session with judge smith , rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the rules committee ( two democrats , including one southerner , and one republican ) .	91.42855
smith flatly rejected the offer , and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels .	23.350481
the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man ' ' .	115.77376
news of rayburn ' s commitment soon leaked out .	173.44672
when missouri ' s clarence cannon got the word , he turned purple .	185.22343
he shouted , and rushed off to the speaker ' s room to object `` a dangerous precedent ' ' ! !	66.18544
cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the smith-colmer forces as chairman of the appropriations committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects .	282.60403
sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally , georgia ' s carl vinson , chairman of the armed services committee .	63.8831
as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that judge smith could lose .	96.93594
his highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus .	166.82657
the liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the democratic committee on committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the house -- before they could oust colmer .	50.75841
( one big question if colmer was to be purged , what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ?	206.52234
) in all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash .	153.0256
but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war .	98.71684
if the southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party .	136.76804
with that possibility in mind , arkansas ' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees , and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise .	103.183945
`` here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone ' ' , said a house democratic leader .	65.95565
`` one wants a little more power , and the other doesn ' t want to give up any ' ' .	23.579323
the senate launched the 87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the house ' s guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guide ' s speech .	102.69878
question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ?	380.9572
a wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from minnesota ' s democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts ' republican leverett saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills .	98.83407
new mexico ' s clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate ' s notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds .	174.99323
fair dealer humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators .	31.238539
georgia ' s dick russell objected politely , and the battle was joined .	42.030113
privately , the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage .	76.72855
privately , they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson ' s three-fifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon .	81.45379
in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress , and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding .	83.72263
armed with the nixon opinion , the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week .	79.690544
hopefully , the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all .	137.99034
since election day , vice president richard nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view .	193.00264
but with the convening of the new congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the senate until john kennedy ' s inauguration .	70.92723
one day last week , nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration ' ' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election .	64.28843
nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration ' ' .	38.9314
`` this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated ' ' , he said .	53.76262
the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves .	70.33705
gary player , the small , trim south african , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap .	105.4994
arnold palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief .	74.45081
`` just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you ' ' , player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament .	237.417
and that is just what happened on the last few holes .	125.86721
the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer .	450.1153
player was the first to feel its teeth .	1.9051682
after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( sunday ' s fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , player ' s game rapidly fell to pieces .	110.220055
after a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th .	92.63645
he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .	117.803635
as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , player was almost in tears .	95.02464
he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke .	135.53531
palmer had started the round four strokes behind player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes .	55.565468
now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf .	65.56265
when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won .	31.87668
but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression .	57.832554
in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower .	133.39299
afterwards , palmer told charlie coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast .	382.19702
he did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out , giving palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost .	95.104515
when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet .	215.31247
palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts ' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt .	101.09356
palmer ' s 281 for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe .	73.17402
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 .	92.18123
until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place .	154.77708
as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69 .	108.56969
his three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by bill collins , the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long .	143.02936
but palmer knew , as did everybody else at augusta , that his streak was about to be broken .	180.48396
half an hour after he finished his round , player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of palmer .	59.57494
long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player .	135.45273
unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case .	64.89193
when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmer ' s towering prestige .	69.3224
as if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments .	118.74604
but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago , player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere .	86.67991
on the final round at pensacola , the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come .	79.51969
on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it .	132.46939
but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour .	134.11931
player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer .	96.80273
he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer ' s 71 .	75.72049
thereafter , until the masters , player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami .	253.57817
when they reached augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date .	208.6479
on thursday , the first day of the masters , the contest between palmer and player developed instantly .	52.540375
it was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course .	152.403
the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences .	153.26192
palmer ' s 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with bob rosburg .	85.49445
but player was only one stroke back , with a 69 .	49.876015
even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between palmer and player .	82.611496
a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70	96.35184
or ken venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better	386.1721
or rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augusta ' s treacheries	170.8933
or even old byron nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf .	277.83344
( on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe .	136.78174
on friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus .	209.52536
rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time palmer and player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day .	69.40655
as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .	182.74353
player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th .	134.58775
on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament .	54.141975
he birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 .	44.39072
starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle , palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 .	79.94098
the roar of palmer ' s gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of player ' s gallery for a similar triumph .	80.99167
at one point late in the day , when palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole .	59.298836
without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply .	107.48071
anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course .	145.36697
it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence .	94.48895
the bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions .	88.70559
and last week at the masters palmer and player did .	141.7923
as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was player ' s superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead .	67.51649
as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day .	81.85335
in fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes .	92.904305
but player ' s real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards .	35.6951
he hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways .	53.589264
having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out .	145.99753
player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling .	31.824215
the latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green .	41.145386
`` i was hitting the ball well ' ' , player said later , `` and i felt strong .	53.259277
when you ' re playing like that you ' d better attack ' ' .	49.92573
player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget .	184.69066
it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge .	103.396225
from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 .	152.54631
palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles .	59.483734
they started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 .	311.02264
on this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days .	64.293
at the 4th tee palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .	71.44541
his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par .	212.27032
starting the second nine , palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it .	71.78105
when mickey charles mantle , the new york yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime .	134.23602
when roger eugene maris , mantle ' s muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe .	84.71021
but when tiny , 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there ' ' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous .	107.97864
this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .	150.3038
it is the year when ( 1 ) amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs	154.19992
( 2 ) willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammate ' s bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game	48.08849
( 3 ) the milwaukee braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them	98.91073
and ( 4 ) catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter .	81.04038
pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal .	71.83742
experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion .	91.305954
whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division .	148.16673
of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy .	197.2105
this , of course , is baseball ' s most remarkable mark the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , george herman ( babe ) ruth of the yankees .	95.722534
since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruth ' s record and each , in turn , has been thwarted .	95.83905
what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth ' s amazing september surge .	104.038704
in the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched .	168.08098
always , in the abortive attacks upon ruth ' s record , one man alone -- a jimmy foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a hank greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a hack wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid .	69.24255
but now , for the first time since lou gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 .	115.09469
their names are mantle and maris , their team is the yankees , and their threat is real .	114.56668
after 108 games in 1927 , ruth had 35 home runs .	34.32123
after 108 games in 1961 , mickey mantle has 43 , roger maris 41 .	118.8849
extend mantle ' s and maris ' s present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs .	176.3551
this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them .	79.110634
to better ruth ' s mark , neither needs a spectacular september flourish .	310.72412
all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september , and he will establish a new record .	50.14413
in ruth ' s day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games .	107.424965
baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruth ' s record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games .	133.39809
`` even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation ' ' , insists hank greenberg , now vice-president of the chicago white sox .	45.4918
`` it has to be easier with two of them .	32.62917
how can you walk maris to get to mantle ' ' ? ?	13.4948225
neither mantle nor maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself .	125.36682
although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player ' s standard quote `` the important thing is to win the pennant ' ' .	106.562195
but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle , the american league ' s most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 , and maris , the mvp in 1960 .	66.041374
each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` i hope roger hits 80 ' ' , mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and i hope i hit 81 ' ' ) .	177.07431
the sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( mantle ' s in dallas , maris ' s in kansas city ) , they are rooming together .	80.05244
mantle , maris , and bob cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in jamaica , long island , not far from new york international airport .	96.32332
the three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture .	101.43045
mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom	49.817364
maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room .	11.899734
they divide up the household chores cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible ) , and maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium .	134.30772
mantle , maris , and cerv probably share one major-league record already among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for cerv , four for mantle , and three for maris .	167.18954
as roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , mantle , 29 , who broke in with the yankees ten years ago , and maris , 26 , who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds .	58.981213
both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( mantle in commerce , okla . , maris in fargo , n . d . )	62.996204
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma ( `` sometimes in the minors ' ' , maris recalls , `` i wished i had gone to oklahoma ' ' ) .	61.746708
to an extent , the two even look alike .	76.89945
both have blue eyes and short blond hair .	17.582369
both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger .	81.72176
with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order .	264.40872
maris purchases $100 suits from simpson ' s in new york .	31.708164
mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and pays as much as $250 each .	282.92697
neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , henry miller ' s `` tropic of cancer ' ' .	86.12297
mantle so appreciated miller ' s delicate literary style that he broadened teammates ' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips .	298.09296
mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .	121.44811
`` what do you and mickey talk about at home ' ' ? ?	12.343292
`` to tell you the truth ' ' , maris said , `` mickey don ' t talk much ' ' .	47.10759
this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer .	22.44656
what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative .	108.18706
of the two , mantle is by nature the less outgoing , maris the more outspoken .	474.9282
but last week , when a reporter was standing near mantle ' s locker , mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote .	122.30152
he said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy .	38.282753
`` that ' s ( yogi ) berra ' s .	8.449648
i ' ll never forget one time i struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game .	159.1711
i came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says ' you stunk ' ' ' .	126.80299
maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen .	101.09973
`` when i ' ve made a dumb play ' ' , he says , `` i don ' t want to talk to anyone .	19.929676
by his own confession , maris is an angry young man .	48.428455
benched at tulsa in 1955 , he told manager dutch meyer `` i can ' t play for you .	121.20495
send me where i can play ' ' .	2.163479
( meyer sent him to reading , pa . .	12.730832
) benched at indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager kerby farrell `` i ' m not learning anything on the bench .	149.28525
( farrell did -- and maris led the team to victory in the little world series .	77.02496
) `` that ' s the way i am ' ' , he says .	10.690637
if you ' re a good ballplayer , you ' ve got to get mad .	35.34601
give me a team of nine angry men and i ' ll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we ' ll beat you nine out of ten times ' ' .	74.02295
one good indication of the two men ' s personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes .	77.56266
`` when i was a kid ' ' , maris told a sportswriter last week , `` i used to follow williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not ' ' .	136.7951
`` when you came up to the majors , did you seek out williams for advice ' ' ? ?	123.95577
`` you ' re afraid to talk to a guy you idolize ' ' .	39.36803
`` when mickey went to the yankees ' ' , says mark freeman , an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver , `` dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his .	197.75658
he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him ' ' .	53.584064
among all the yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies .	238.02515
neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else .	130.85092
if laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the yankees , maris would lay ties on a railroad track .	105.04731
if working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the yankees , mantle would work in a zinc mine .	81.89457
but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , mantle and maris concentrate on baseball .	112.78543
they try to play baseball the best they can .	158.13995
mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well .	204.67972
( `` one of the reasons they get along fine ' ' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize mantle is head-and-shoulders above maris ' ' .	95.80876
) hitting , mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , maris only left-handed .	64.12993
they both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings .	97.76319
both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues	74.40773
mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base .	161.59296
both have brilliant speed mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3 . 1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer	78.2063
maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the white sox .	70.21491
both are good , daring fielders mantle covers more ground	1770.7524
yet with all their skills , the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic the home run .	184.45805
with this ultimate weapon , the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season .	192.0966
( american league expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams .	224.70944
only two teams in each league ( the yankees and detroit , the dodgers and cincinnati ) are battling for first place .	166.2338
appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball ' s lowest moment .	159.68834
in 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball .	122.70094
into washington on president-elect john f . kennedy ' s convair , the caroline , winged actor-crooner frank sinatra and his close hollywood pal , cinemactor peter lawford , jack kennedy ' s brother-in-law .	133.0716
also included in the entourage a dog in a black sweater , frankie and peter had an urgent mission to stage a mammoth inauguration eve entertainment gala in the capital ' s national guard armory .	132.36003
frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival `` it ' s really tremendous when you think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia .	127.96576
i could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans ' ' ! !	39.73631
as the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory ' s $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10 , 000 each .	70.34504
the biggest single act would doubtless be staged by frankie himself his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by hollywood couturier don loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles .	135.69646
soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered `` two of everything ' ' just `` in case he spills anything ' ' , frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of loper clothing .	143.45946
a year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps , general david m . shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless new year ' ' greeting to his pentagon staff .	182.12415
said leatherneck shoup `` a year ago i took the grips of the plow in my hands .	72.82795
after pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , i lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on .	180.54991
little geeing and hawing have been necessary ' ' .	1.5437111
but shoup also gave the corps a tilling in spots .	100.8863
speaking of `` pride ' ' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940	287.4308
the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window .	100.92426
a few of these people are still around ' ' .	6.390138
old and new briefly crossed paths in the u . s . senate , then went their respective ways .	72.14723
at a reception for new members of congress , oregon democrat maurine neuberger , taking the senate seat held by her husband richard until his death last march , got a brotherly buss from democratic elder statesman adlai stevenson , u . s . ambassador-designate to the u . n . .	51.439274
meanwhile , after 24 years in the senate , rhode island ' s durable democrat theodore francis greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last november ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the senate .	130.34358
the most famous undergraduate of south philadelphia high school is a current bobby-sox idol , dreamboat cacophonist fabian ( real name fabian forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while .	150.54869
the principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia -- fabian is a 10-o ' clock scholar in english and mathematics .	154.68936
lacking his needed credits in those subjects , fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week .	249.57576
south philadelphia high ' s principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure ' ' of a movie that the toneless lad was making .	91.741806
to decathlon man rafer johnson ( time cover , aug . 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer ' s olympic games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the a . a . u . ' s james e . sullivan memorial trophy as the outstanding u . s . amateur athlete of 1960 .	84.49894
as the world ' s top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- sports illustrated tapped golf ' s confident arnold palmer ( time cover , may 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the masters and u . s . open crowns , went on to win a record $80 , 738 for the year .	99.181305
tooling through sydney on his way to race in the new zealand grand prix , britain ' s balding ace driver stirling moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination .	89.57645
`` i ' m a slob ' ' , he announced .	46.90566
i ' m useless for anything but racing cars .	32.85239
i ' m ruddy lazy , and i ' m getting on in years .	82.4367
it gets so frustrating , but then again i don ' t know what i could do if i gave up racing ' ' .	36.398514
one of nikita khrushchev ' s most enthusiastic eulogizers , the u . s . s . r . ' s daily izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed red-prone comedian charlie chaplin at his swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 .	47.9989
chaplin , 71 , who met k . when the soviet boss visited england in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit russia some time this summer because `` i have marveled at your grandiose experiment and i believe in your future ' ' .	99.87591
then charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the nikita he had glimpsed `` i was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face ' ' .	140.61348
g . david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe ' s best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh .	95.5729
there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art .	108.6093
last week , in the german city of dusseldorf , g . david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause .	182.9117
on display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale .	160.41107
like philadelphia ' s late dr . albert c . barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( time , jan . 2 ) , thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime .	64.20826
he made his fortune during world war 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom .	96.00293
even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings .	119.98845
he gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best .	30.087147
he was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the museum of modern art ' s alfred barr said of him `` i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didn ' t know about ' ' .	71.088905
he might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting .	104.8171
he could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough .	92.29814
he bought up cezannes , braques , matisses , legers , a splendid picasso series , more than 70 giacometti sculptures .	123.66891
he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world .	36.71187
all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone ' s throw , outside pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them .	129.38963
two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city .	17.115177
but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum .	40.133778
pittsburgh turned him down , just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years .	178.81235
he went then to a 40-year-old basel art dealer named ernst beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures .	55.66016
last year beyeler arranged to sell $1 , 500 , 000 worth of klees to the state of north rhine-westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built .	65.63138
last week most of the other prizes , once offered to pittsburgh , went on the block .	136.67885
at the opening of the dusseldorf show , thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time .	102.68129
in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them .	23.417467
some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town .	71.73148
thompson himself said `` i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures ' ' .	112.26438
the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color .	48.014618
but in all its 175 years , not a single negro student has entered its classrooms .	154.82773
last week federal district judge william a . bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified ' ' negro boy and girl .	85.40062
their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in georgia -- and in alabama , mississippi and south carolina as well .	101.63975
for 18 months , hamilton holmes , 19 , and charlayne hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university .	56.09187
they graduated together from atlanta ' s turner high school , where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third .	195.4081
the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins .	143.41794
holmes went to atlanta ' s morehouse ( negro ) college , where he is a b student and star halfback .	121.943214
charlayne studied journalism at detroit ' s wayne state university .	322.23633
last fall , after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court , judge bootle ordered them to apply again .	152.46239
charlayne was `` tentatively ' ' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state .	407.86267
but holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview ' ' .	46.146965
the evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation .	231.06474
holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse ' ' .	40.66019
no , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive ' ' .	32.863663
they also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested ' ' .	8.897783
their reason holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended .	378.07892
negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes .	213.87152
the real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school .	92.54228

`` surprised and pleased ' ' , students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week .	131.23854
when the university of chicago ' s chancellor lawrence a . kimpton submitted his resignation last march , a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway .	58.710526
out went letters to 60 , 000 old grads , asking for suggestions .	103.65222
such academic statesmen as james b . conant were consulted .	43.050434
two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors , including adlai stevenson , richard nixon , and harvard ' s dean mcgeorge bundy .	21.697992
the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as trustee chairman glen a . lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right ' ' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago .	144.55106
last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech ' s acting dean of the faculty dynamic geneticist george wells beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( time , cover , july 14 , 1958 ) .	82.85799
it fell to chancellor kimpton , now a standard oil ( indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins .	203.19307
he threw out some of hutchins ' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2 , 100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139 . 3 million .	115.95784
but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era .	160.66898
at caltech , geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school ' s famous biology division since 1946 .	107.882034
but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making .	232.74936
beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters	138.99072
he avidly reads the wall street journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model a ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 .	171.61493
a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end .	94.514404
but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away .	147.24704
the man was king leopold 2 , of the belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good .	68.236496
by force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900 , 000 square miles of wilderness in central africa .	62.785954
this is an area nearly as large as western europe	113.64298
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .	143.5346
its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings	30.047476
they were determined by the points at which leopold ' s explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .	73.89035
the population of the congo is 13 . 5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters ' ' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects .	195.69763
the religions of the people include christianity , mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism .	31.294872
the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate .	189.15126
the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .	183.7319
to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case	87.631134
it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done , or failed to do , in the congo since 1885 .	98.566795
at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property .	134.13121
but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience .	120.50001
the belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism .	64.42536
one definition of paternalism is `` the principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children ' ' .	69.55136
the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment .	121.66756
ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant .	110.39536
the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil .	44.725018
the colony was administered from brussels , with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote .	472.45197
the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock .	139.29282
in inside africa , john gunther describes one of these , the societe generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the house of morgan , anaconda copper , the mutual life insurance company of new york , the pennsylvania railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the united states government as a heavy partner ' ' .	93.23999
had they been truly ruthless , the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion .	385.99722
they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes	242.54485
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent	59.9557
they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food .	127.78424
but instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often .	111.01351
would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ?	144.31511
the belgians also placed great emphasis on education .	3.6467187
during the 1950s there were as many as 25 , 000 schools in the congo .	43.12712
the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte ' ' and `` le chien ' ' and write his name .	67.355415
some schools were technical -- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .	108.81546
but they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .	57.937717
it was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together ' ' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .	123.82138
indeed , the belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .	117.39826
when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13 . 5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .	214.64503
why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ?	68.2199
in one large oversimplification , it might be said that the belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping africa .	121.35028
they lacked time to prepare the congo , as the british and french had prepared their colonies .	97.96726
the congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant	103.990746
and in brussels , street crowds shouted , `` pas une goutte de sang ! !	157.09772
' ' ( not one drop of blood ! !	23.02923
the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue	340.56857
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess .	88.91784
it is hard to blame them for this .	41.7361
yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless .	242.66861
as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate .	167.55397
first , there were those congolese ( among them joseph kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , balkanizing it .	162.58002
second , there were those ( moise tshombe ) who favored near-balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states .	119.50601
third , there were those ( notably patrice lumumba ) who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government .	54.295082
and fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up .	98.3514
however , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting .	96.05472
a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration .	73.88218
they had divided the congo into six provinces -- leopoldville , kasai , kivu , katanga , equator and eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings .	100.23799
thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war .	157.39532
the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable western-style form of government there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces .	87.66687
well-wishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .	89.69839
if internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25 , 000-man congolese army , the force publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians .	88.693794
the president , joseph kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , patrice lumumba , a reasonable man .	156.71301
twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other .	86.25252
presently the well-armed members of the force publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting .	88.21061
terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country .	30.05767
the belgian government decided to act , and on july 10 dispatched paratroops to the congo .	32.431084
on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of katanga , moise tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country .	61.908092
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence .	8.11093
lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians , and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them .	30.564404
on july 14 the security council -- with france and great britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the u . n . into the congo .	94.839096
vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( congolese ) government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the government , to meet fully their tasks .	66.1461
secretary-general hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the u . n . troops sent into the congo were to come from african , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the u . s . , russia , great britain or france .	50.98378
he quickly called on ghana , tunisia , morocco , guinea and mali , which dispatched troops within hours .	116.96471
ultimately the u . n . army in the congo reached a top strength of 19 , 000 , including about 5 , 000 from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden , who were the only whites .	85.38849
it took the u . n . three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo .	40.95612
the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed u . n . efforts .	81.491554
the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the u . n . to get out of the congo along with the belgians , and appealed to russia for help .	57.48728
( however , there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist .	111.62644
before appealing to the u . n . or to russia , he first appealed to the u . s . for military help , and was rejected .	64.370605
) lumumba further complicated the u . n . ' s mission by initiating small `` wars ' ' with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which , under albert kalonji , wanted to secede as well .	54.00814
meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo , sending lumumba equipment for his `` wars ' ' , dispatching `` technicians ' ' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly .	68.34992
but by the end of the three-month period , in october 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the congo .	52.61071
president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him .	27.313145
control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of joseph mobutu , chief of staff of the congolese army .	131.23122
mobutu promptly flung out the russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at u . n . headquarters in new york .	119.24139
the belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops .	51.46098
but they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers ' ' or `` mercenaries ' ' , who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga , the seceded province which , according to tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country .	73.76897
from october 1960 to february 1961 , the u . n . forces in the congo took little action .	42.463295
there was no directive for it -- the security council ' s resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or balkanize it .	104.417015
during the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo .	35.261158
in february the murder of patrice lumumba , who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe , again stirred the u . n . to action .	92.56867
on feb . 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort ' ' .	50.46857
although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one .	148.0625
it also urged that the u . n . eject , and prevent the return of , all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers	118.83145
urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army .	19.899546
though president john f . kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloy ' s unexpected report from khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of u . s . foreign policy last week .	83.16646
high up on the president ' s priority list was the thorny question of bizerte .	146.85718
on this issue , the president received a detailed report from his u . n . ambassador adlai stevenson , who had just returned from paris , and mr . kennedy asked stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both paris and tunis -- out of the imbroglio .	59.072662
ideally , the president would like the french to agree on a `` status quo ante ' ' on bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base .	70.071655
to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , mr . kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend .	67.49595
the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no . 2 man in the tunisian government , defense minister bahi ladgham , who flew to washington last week to seek u . s . support .	88.59898
the conversation apparently convinced mr . kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable .	134.67603
through ladgham , mr . kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba	268.8843
and one u . s . official said `` the key question now is which side picks up the phone first ' ' .	89.85271
on the latin american front , the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the inter-american economic and social council ( which the president himself had originally hoped to attend ) .	121.91583
main purpose of the meeting to discuss president kennedy ' s alliance for progress .	23.985573
in conferences with nationalist china ' s dapper , diminutive vice president chen cheng , mr . kennedy assured chiang kai-shek ' s emissary that the u . s . is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations .	42.07338
chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia	148.00143
however the president , who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow , would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the u . s . if outer mongolia ' s admission comes to a vote .	82.87782
the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid .	176.20609
to africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , attorney general robert kennedy , on a good-will mission to the ivory coast .	82.657715
all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs	144.84402
in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared `` we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason ' ' .	95.970665
from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston , as the great four-jet boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at phoenix , el paso , and san antonio .	77.66118
when continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11 30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer .	43.746574
the plane put down on schedule at 1 35 a . m . in phoenix .	39.71297
thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for el paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard .	117.603424
at 3 57 a . m . , with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso , passenger robert berry , a san antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit .	77.95008
`` the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach ' ' , berry said .	34.5617
`` i figured he was sick ' ' .	1.7490671
john salvador , a farmer from palm desert , calif . , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit .	52.088917
`` the kid had a automatic , like they issue in the army ' ' , he said .	67.693695
`` the other fellow had a ' ' .	2.715336
salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess lois carnegey	59.387203
the man put his at the head of capt . byron d . rickards .	59.168823
to rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story his plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa .	81.78886
but last week ' s pirates , like the cuban-american who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra ( newsweek , aug . 7 ) , wanted to go to havana .	102.28971
`` tell your company there are four of us here with guns ' ' , the elder man told rickards .	126.53898
the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message .	276.0516
but , he told the `` skyjackers ' ' , the 707 didn ' t carry enough fuel to reach havana	84.31187
they would have to refuel at el paso .	28.317173
most passengers didn ' t know what had happened until they got on the ground .	46.646725
jerry mccauley of sacramento , calif . , one of some twenty air force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion .	165.01048
`` the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba ' ' , mccauley said , `` and like a nut i raised my hand .	91.51395
i thought he was the air force recruiter ' ' .	4.7178144
what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew .	151.9689
they chose four jack casey , who works for continental airlines in houston	120.244934
pfc . truman cleveland of st . augustine .	7.3966107
fla . , and leonard gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the u . s . immigration service border patrol .	50.17192
everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at 4 18 a . m . .	136.72063
they found a large welcoming group -- el paso policemen , border patrol , sheriff ' s deputies , and fbi men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns .	56.913063
other fbi men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana .	45.511196
the ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours .	93.4713
still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propeller-driven douglas aj .	190.87102
actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane	132.8481
they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of cuba ' s fidel castro who had taken over the 707 .	100.42443
mr . kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone .	130.05632
at one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot , the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba .	73.48918
as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment .	127.528946
from the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being cubans , were native americans , subsequently identified as leon bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge , ariz . , and his son , cody , 16 , a high-school junior .	75.07558
the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens .	15.191738
the father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business ' ' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons .	128.97163
at 7 30 a . m . , more than three hours after landing , the beardens gave an ultimatum	98.15748
the tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a . m . , and captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway .	54.697952
several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet .	96.56313
the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines	37.557007
ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it .	74.29187
at 12 50 p . m . a ramp was rolled up to the plane .	62.656727
a few minutes later , fbi agent francis crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed .	66.664604
while crosby distracted the beardens , stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door .	62.254498
so did hostages casey , cleveland , and mullen .	582.9237
that left only the four crew members , crosby , and border patrolman gilman , all unarmed , with the beardens .	69.44541
the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket .	57.25945
gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance .	60.081944
he caught officer simmons ' eye , nodded toward young bearden , and -- `` i swung my right as hard as i could .	89.106804
simmons and crosby jumped the boy and it was all over ' ' .	32.19943
frog-marched off the airplane at 1 48 p . m . , the beardens were held in bail of $100 , 000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines .	78.480125
( bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to castro , and live high in cuba .	211.20737
) back home in coolidge , ariz . , his 36-year-old wife , mary , said `` i thought they were going to phoenix to look for jobs ' ' .	83.47074
taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation .	43.586098
the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in u . s . history .	59.385365
with the money all but in hand , however , the administration indicated that , instead of the 225 , 000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160 , 000 .	56.765865
the `` hold-back ' ' , as pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently .	129.3012
in all , the senate signed a check for $46 . 7 billion , which not only included the extra $3 . 5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for .	95.22259
( the senate , on its own , decided to provide additional b-52 and other long-range bombers for the strategic air command .	106.39201
) the house , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the president ' s urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order .	199.44421
in other areas , congressional action last week included	2691.9053
the senate ( by voice vote ) and the house ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign , not too unhappily .	113.02345
the senate also voted $5 . 2 billion to finance the government ' s health , welfare , and labor activities .	42.90232
debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend .	73.94365
white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact .	125.994995
most members of the u . s . senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can .	119.21568
but , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter .	223.60382
as a result , ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it .	114.613396
over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-american course .	81.424934
individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from michigan , soft-shell crabs from maryland , oysters from washington , grapefruit from florida .	165.07242
but plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late sen . fred dubois of idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the senate ' s stomach was in the right place .	84.937
in a daring stroke , the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10 , 000-per-year french-born maitre d ' hotel .	185.69913
holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .	128.13606
long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward .	284.001
higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues .	16.93629
result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .	424.73746
things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds .	222.44011
traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .	240.17723
that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates .	27.818811
as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments .	155.3085
another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds .	97.01271
other tax-exempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21 , according to standard & poor ' s average .	241.88916
on balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then .	668.5376
however , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend .	162.48291
on these bonds , price rises since february 21 easily outnumber price declines .	371.77463
investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds .	208.67068
you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page .	168.76305
many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that .	81.9672
and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds .	243.18002
that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds .	228.8366
it ' s not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on u . s . treasury bonds .	76.58837
for investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high .	32.83519
it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16 , 000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32 , 000 of taxed income .	46.454906
a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in february or march -- shows what is happening .	127.54786
the report is based on a survey by blyth & company , investment bankers .	123.10379
nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period .	8.922951
and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession .	91.18069
many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .	163.49654
indication the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward .	24.74527
look , for example , at the ohio turnpike .	7.6719294
traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february , as compared with those same months in 1960 .	89.43048
then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs .	59.63693
as a result , the road ' s net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds .	30.96506
that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months .	30.846441
that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike .	40.779457
operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in march .	54.939667
costs were held down , despite a bitter winter .	55.28775
for the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period .	23.719917
the road ' s engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston .	81.62409
some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do .	82.53755
the 187-mile illinois state toll highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until december , 1958 .	136.6823
in the 12 months ended in february , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves .	51.02397
in the 12 months ended in february , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest .	14.487714
in the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 .	118.420685
success , for many turnpikes , has come hard .	582.0588
traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers ' rosy estimates .	229.76051
in these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways .	166.10432
many rate increases already have been put into effect .	117.62581
higher tolls are planned for july 1 , 1961 , on the richmond-petersburg , va . , turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study .	97.51211
progress is being made , too , in improving motorists ' access to many turnpikes .	120.36666
net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb . 28 , 1961 .	31.05525
further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city , kans . , and kansas city , mo . .	67.41229
meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road ' s reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .	140.78859
investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals .	85.30624
traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike .	98.20341
if nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 .	86.63454
west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same .	60.93504
the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement .	176.82227
it ' s going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full .	104.80536
already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins .	361.91986
many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point .	46.35381
a top american official , after a look at europe ' s factories , thinks the u . s . is in a `` very serious situation ' ' competitively .	85.907974
commerce secretary luther hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on may 10 toured plants of two of italy ' s biggest companies -- fiat , the auto producer , and olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines .	134.05046
our staff man cabled from turin as follows --	159.55971
`` follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant , and you learn this	115.77127
`` one , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the marshall plan -- enables fiat to turn out 2 , 100 cars a day .	191.45831
`` two , wage costs are a fraction of the u . s . costs .	8.057288
a skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week .	123.99337
fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years .	60.83865
`` said secretary hodges ' it ' s a tough combination for the u . s . to face .	61.141342
`` olivetti had a special interest for hodges .	6.1386824
olivetti took over underwood , the u . s . typewriter maker , in late 1959 .	53.36213
within a year , without reducing wages , underwood ' s production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed .	271.86478
the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled .	213.86122
`` the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout , modern machinery .	121.83325
the firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious .	53.886696
`` hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the u . s . .	19.042606
the inflow of foreign capital would help the u . s . balance of payments .	16.068295
`` hodges predicted ' i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the u . s . .	31.672419
there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' ' ' .	50.363945
foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports .	184.48708
the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines .	192.84515
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these	3036.4028
an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy .	109.703316
chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting .	14.399177
the u . s . will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years .	110.947525
point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet .	97.37657
if they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would .	226.2013
idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible .	34.138306
at the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries .	283.776
japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily ' ' curbing exports of textiles to the u . s . .	19.977993
hong kong , india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the `` lancashire pact ' ' .	67.504196
none of these countries is happy with these arrangements .	539.3287
the japanese want to increase exports to the u . s . while they have been curbing shipments , they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big u . s . market .	62.335564
hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain , while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly .	74.77803
the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons .	93.84832
the kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in asia and europe will see that `` dumping ' ' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas .	148.47934
gradual , controlled expansion of the world ' s textile trade is what president kennedy wants .	40.747105
this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products .	49.431435
it ' s an important clue to washington thinking .	11.894149
note , too , that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the u . s . textile industry .	37.416187
`` get competitive or get out ' ' .	1.9132446
in veiled terms , that ' s what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry .	47.150864
the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn ' t seem feasible .	103.69656
special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed .	561.52374
government research will look into new products and methods .	306.4673
import quotas aren ' t ruled out where the national interest is involved .	65.369865
but the kennedy administration doesn ' t favor import quotas .	7.411985
rather , they are impressed with the british government ' s success in forcing -- and helping -- the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products .	112.89305
what ' s happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries .	290.54962
among the highest-paid workers in the world are u . s . coal miners .	27.60697
yet u . s . coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers ' mouths water .	45.412365
steel company of wales , a british steelmaker , wants to bring in virginia coal , cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets .	72.78337
virginia coal , delivered by ship in wales , will be about $2 . 80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines .	72.19741
u . s . coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight .	133.84523
many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting , narrow and very deep .	109.5873
productivity of u . s . miners is twice that of the british .	157.86803
welsh coal miners , communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal .	84.712715
the british government will have to decide whether to let u . s . coal in .	102.11913
the british coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can ' t sell .	113.75651
every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` i ' m sorry , but we don ' t have that book .	69.55985
there wouldn ' t be much demand for it , i ' m afraid ' ' .	22.061693
behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest .	275.59354
what to buy out of the year ' s grist of nearly 15 , 000 book titles ? ?	167.14476
what to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ?	135.6066
a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian ' s salary , and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world ' s richest city .	72.21225
the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse .	365.07147
confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds .	93.26063
in some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis .	83.48893
new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow .	149.96547
because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the new york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works .	86.91644
at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area .	99.28285
at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve .	109.52247
both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state .	107.26665
it was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today .	88.63912
under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts .	338.26212
an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit .	177.62247
some library boards are wary of the plan .	11.681311
a large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great .	152.0495
a small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board .	210.4028
within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved .	54.35412
the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system .	107.55192
all services are given without cost to members .	8.80193
so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op .	59.599316
to set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100 , 000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it .	128.47543
the collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection .	55.66534
each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency .	126.28142
the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars .	77.87499
in nassau county , for example , the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 .	138.48293
this system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation .	93.86971
the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area .	90.998566
the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford .	121.330086
nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100 , 000 volumes by 1965 .	65.73179
the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers .	97.32268
basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries .	107.98291
on microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals .	60.185917
the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans .	109.52895
it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide .	196.13942
the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries .	138.11113
each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon .	373.6291
east meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion	577.4542
freeport houses social science , pure science , and language	120.642876
history , biography , and education are centered in hempstead	132.85254
levittown has applied science , business , and literature	1495.7589
while hewlett-woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages .	130.80763
the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service .	92.67944
this kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course .	40.355923
public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis .	120.7353
local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library .	147.19348
the system passes on these savings to its members .	19.723085
further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing .	90.47819
books are not the only resource of the system .	232.41132
schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities .	174.58066
the most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge .	167.1175
this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` nanook of the north ' ' , `` the emperor ' s nightingale ' ' , and `` the red balloon ' ' .	57.942303
workshops are conducted by the system ' s audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service .	94.16304
the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together	445.48752
consequently an experienced children ' s librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children ' s librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits .	108.764206
headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection .	146.57893
sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups .	190.61444
story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children ' s consultant .	62.195126
headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries .	126.07805
in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children ' s program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county	127.26274
it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries	119.29888
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used	520.22205
and it publishes sum and substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system ' s activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries .	83.266365
the system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership .	70.655624
in nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general .	79.42833
librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today .	204.24762
library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans , the teen-agers .	215.92947
to them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` i ' m sorry , we don ' t have that book ' ' .	43.27863
today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned .	197.22375
the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world .	124.71102
education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society .	83.15301
the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life .	32.471874
we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read	203.09242
if we do not know how to use what we do read .	118.314735
we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word .	157.45786
a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries .	132.37032
although progress has been made in america ' s system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america .	185.73172
the problem grows in intensity each year as man ' s knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand .	97.405785
the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition .	171.42159
there are , for example , approximately 25 , 000 , 000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50 , 000 , 000 with inadequate service .	41.39721
in college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1 , 509 institutions surveyed last year by the u . s . office of education .	44.5937
and over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all .	119.038055
in every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services .	97.72157
only public understanding and support can provide that service .	225.46721
this is one of the main reasons for national library week , april 16-22 , and for its theme `` for a richer , fuller life , read ' ' ! !	166.69354
the general assembly , which adjourns today , has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened .	213.00603
it was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools , an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education .	126.10709
there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight , in which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers .	68.63533
the final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need .	235.00888
long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government .	139.775
this session , for instance , may have insured a financial crisis two years from now .	258.7978
in all the turmoil , some good legislation was passed .	64.29616
some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action .	229.89397
certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue .	167.86143
no action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales .	119.080185
only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state .	126.19978
the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions .	38.67806
fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like anything but `` the empire state of the south ' ' .	89.47211
we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation .	93.13748
in the interim between now and next year , we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgia ' s very real economic , fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics .	180.155
the league of women voters , 40 now and admitting it proudly , is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive .	183.02606

these women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jefferson ' s dictum that one must cherish the people ' s spirit but `` keep alive their attention ' ' .	103.167854
`` if once they become inattentive to the public affairs ' ' , jefferson said , `` you and i , and congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves ' ' .	104.07374
newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs .	238.74207
the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public .	88.03513
the harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in .	537.0987
and the league takes a stand , with great regularity , on the side of right .	42.564827
cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission .	77.712814
coupling its own budget of $83 , 750 with a $30 , 000 state grant authorized by gov . vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in march with georgia tech . .	76.0765
then a full-time planning office will be established in rome to work with a five-member georgia tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program .	64.139984
it recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach .	388.5341
the rusk belief in balanced defense , replacing the dulles theory of massive retaliation , removes a grave danger that has existed .	94.91274
the danger lay not in believing that our own a-bombs would deter russia ' s use of hers	99.29043
the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough .	323.98615
by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war .	159.62273
this strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war .	16.270456
it also weakened our diplomatic stance , because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity .	115.605064
this left the soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity .	150.12709
by maintaining the nuclear deterrent , but gearing american military forces to fight conventional wars too , secretary of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position .	177.7821
dekalb ' s budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance .	251.0436
it includes a raise in the county minimum wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance .	171.61877
that such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by chairman charles o . emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials .	67.89832
g . mennen williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly .	167.15033
touring africa , the new u . s . assistant secretary of state observed `` africa should be for the africans ' ' and the british promptly denounced him .	49.940506

confidence in the state ' s economic future is reflected in the georgia power company ' s record construction budget for this year .	98.425476
the firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning .	211.29106
it is good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization .	106.44742
georgia ' s mental health program received a badly needed boost from the general assembly in the form of a $1 , 750 , 000 budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital .	72.89893
actually it amounts to $1 , 250 , 000 above what the institution already is receiving , considering the additional half-million dollars gov . vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus .	153.31082
either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is .	78.3227
but exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing .	244.56024
the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished .	96.69391
the work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced .	184.2766
more attendants , nurses and doctors should be hired .	100.101234
patients deserve more attention than they are getting .	45.07318
even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year , georgia will be spending only around $3 . 15 per day per patient .	103.43198
the national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low .	141.05638
kansas , regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill , spends $9 per day per patient .	89.128555
but in so many other areas we still are dragging .	57.93007
considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done , it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted .	232.67944
assassination , even of a tyrant , is repulsive to men of good conscience .	344.21588
rafael trujillo , the often blood-thirsty dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history .	74.31107
but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered .	191.67993
the responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez , a professor at columbia university in new york , has been laid at his door .	45.945538
he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela .	85.95255
it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez , has been uncovered and quashed .	89.92309
the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive .	99.699814
unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably .	219.61075
but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition .	310.2619
el benefactor ' s vanity grew with his personal wealth .	119.20517
the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure .	125.15776
he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise , and his influence extended even to congress .	140.79866
until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character .	96.15407
tardily the government here came to understand how this country ' s own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression .	69.86487
last year , after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean , the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him .	64.50999
thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines .	53.995663
trujillo ' s dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines .	65.06495
but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans .	108.095474
there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba , previously a bete noire to trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces .	147.39154
what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle .	15.461017
the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed .	113.15918
perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger .	74.38148
the dominican republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom .	135.85152
such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people , who deserve to breathe without fear .	76.45296
for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help .	121.22235
high-speed buses on the george washington memorial parkway , operating between downtown washington and cabin john , glen echo and brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city .	237.87979
in presenting plans for such express buses before the montgomery county council , the administrator of the ncta , c . darwin stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching .	120.17247
such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area .	139.03355
because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed .	120.12172
the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress .	45.921158
the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city .	164.88905
so far as the record is concerned , the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so .	298.8367
though walter ulbricht , by grace of soviet tanks , may be head man in east germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone .	99.79141
the wartime protocol of september 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` greater berlin ' ' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation .	102.23778
it was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by soviet , american , british , and french troops respectively .	200.54002
after the berlin blockade and airlift , the council of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin ' ' .	117.95821
for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas .	51.808533
then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany .	43.096153
that this and the closing of the east berlin-west berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain , france , and the united states sent to moscow after the latter ' s gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german officials to west berlin .	99.52559
the chancellor had as much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard eisler .	79.26144
the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities `` to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany ' ' .	64.70614
they insisted on the `` fundamental fact ' ' that `` the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status ' ' .	47.14293
this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact .	292.03473
there remains , of course , the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts .	152.06764
one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist `` vopos ' ' try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents .	127.08816
another remained when an american army car was recovered but with a broken glass .	117.53577
the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed .	116.16439
remembering the step-by-step fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about `` salami ' ' tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy ' s representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed .	87.65224
thousands of buffalo ( `` bison ' ' they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland .	210.65659
a horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth .	243.06145
that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west made in live-oak canyons near hollywood .	136.3723
for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill .	132.60564
the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county , northeast kansas , as a `` prairie national park ' ' .	54.96073
there the buffalo would roam , to be seen as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens .	137.87189
wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved .	23.18602
grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them .	199.2542
the park service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park .	245.10884
american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to approve .	82.31254
a philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on tv and radio .	96.25784
starting with small stations not members of the national association of broadcasters , the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations .	113.0711
probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power .	234.90044
the national association of broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials .	33.83614
past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy .	53.087624
even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition .	200.99016
why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action ? ?	140.15167
simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread .	153.72054
soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors .	346.45337
although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsie-cola and gulling him into downing bourbon .	175.30031
registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect their party ' s candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization .	128.11809
in the central contest , that for mayor , they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other .	130.30008
mayor robert f . wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office .	203.99269
while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools , law enforcement and fiscal policies .	131.48727
the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record .	26.613243
state controller arthur levitt , on the other hand , cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city ' s welfare .	77.712036
they , too , have links with the city ' s ills .	41.88747
both men are known to be honest and public-spirited .	1363.0338
mayor wagner ' s shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of mr . levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post .	205.35515
as mayor , mr . levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like .	130.93207
his election , on the other hand , would unquestionably strengthen the `` regulars ' ' .	65.75853
mr . wagner might or might not be a `` new ' ' mayor in this third term , now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls `` bosses ' ' .	92.845665
these are , of course , the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote .	391.4147
but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him .	122.29534
if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be made .	118.53271
the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party .	54.257412
both mr . k ' s have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos .	469.53326
president kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refused thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow .	201.76788
but at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting .	136.48953
and secretary rusk , en route to bangkok , doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai seato forces .	170.72446
for mr . kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation .	79.17478
the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs .	112.61621
he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says .	62.83058
in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr . khrushchev for the third time .	76.74399
at his press conference mr . kennedy said , `` all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn ' ' .	141.82983
at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position .	867.8723
since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington , this approach might be expected to head off mr . khrushchev for the moment .	115.252525
but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos , the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot , but would bog washington in a tactical mess .	108.33139
as wars go , laos is an extremely little one .	503.24612
casualties have been running about a dozen men a day .	116.53821
the hard core of the pro-communist rebel force numbers only some 2 , 000 tough viet minh guerrilla fighters .	68.406685
but for the united states and its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th ' -wisp terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners .	295.2594
but if anything can bring home to mr . khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this braddock-against-the-indians contest , it will probably be the fact that seato forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington .	97.82223
fortunately both the republicans and america ' s chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president .	204.23009
actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table .	161.0214
it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable .	207.48888
the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 , and last year washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma .	53.531788
but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers .	210.1369
the road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation ' s terrain .	223.17625
but for the safety of southeast asia , and for the sake of the laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made .	96.36232
the world awaits mr . khrushchev ' s choice of alternatives .	48.92133
the senate ' s overwhelming ( 64-13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower house .	270.24167
twice previously the senate has approved measures backing etv and the house has let them die .	238.17558
the house communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds .	144.22513
this year ' s senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with $1 , 000 , 000 to be used in support of private , state , or municipal etv efforts .	48.798107
the funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation .	226.96268
the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value .	171.62442
but , lacking money from commercial sponsors , the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service .	250.74942
other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment .	174.4012
sam rayburn was a good man , a good american , and , third , a good democrat .	198.03192
he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure	694.96423
mr . speaker , mr . sam , and mr . democrat , at one and the same time .	55.45242
the house was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , speaker of the house , and second most powerful man in washington .	151.28854
mr . rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label .	44.41185
he was no flaming liberal , yet the new deal , the fair deal and the new frontier needed him .	49.46323
he was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any .	249.14722
two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word .	373.18805
sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction .	145.85217
it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs .	267.7903
the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical .	27.653994
a growl , a nod , was usually enough .	47.808125
when it was not , one of the great dramas of washington would be presented .	234.02101
he would rise in the well of the house , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence .	107.70229
he spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes .	164.78545
he made good , plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it .	299.25723
these public efforts were rare because mr . rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor .	299.09958
he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them .	71.28297
with his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader .	129.46468
he was , of course , in the house for a very long time .	139.06094
there are only two men remaining in congress who , with rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917 .	67.36566
to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr . sam coincided with that of the house .	70.18578
to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition .	57.913662
the senate to him was not the `` upper body ' ' and he corrected those who said he served `` under ' ' the president .	89.72576
sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death .	153.80946
woodrow wilson , with whom he began his years in washington , warren g . harding , calvin coolidge , fdr , with whom he managed a social revolution .	74.90611
and those still with us , herbert c . hoover , harry s . truman , dwight d . eisenhower and john f . kennedy .	33.129658
he was a fighter for those of his own party .	62.993774
mr . truman has only to recall the `` hopeless ' ' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr . kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr . sam been there .	154.43495
as it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration .	49.69904
he was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist .	91.62538
he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play .	36.332325
under any name -- mr . speaker , mr . democrat , mr . sam -- he was a good man .	32.271507
thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends .	144.93985
in 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle .	39.324375
simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river .	76.66433
the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries .	72.0032
in other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga .	148.61783
does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ? ?	291.6501
to the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence .	305.8576
mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences .	122.73758
yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga .	83.4428
it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it .	102.50821
the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ?	124.0486
the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa .	182.22134
right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga .	196.32123
that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view .	9.747686
the un army is too weak , too demoralized for the task .	218.10577
further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned .	367.92847
last , it makes no sense to deliver katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos .	161.14998
the congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence .	42.652122
the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom .	38.78529
it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism .	103.150536
but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach .	104.79396
otherwise , un will march blindly on to certain defeat .	356.24048
a recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific co . and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information .	58.64639
the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours ' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year .	164.51968
our comment was that this was `` featherbedding ' ' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement .	109.09886
the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life .	110.21654
additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need .	128.3791
also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic .	277.09293
the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries .	163.13254
the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands .	140.8515
time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side .	102.64585
but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in st . louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there .	68.088646
it was , the brief writers decided , `` man ' s best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world ' ' .	75.12134
peace , it ' s wonderful , and `` world law ' ' , it ' s wonderful , too , and shouldn ' t we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? ?	105.11009
meanwhile , in moscow , khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can ' t see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism .	142.85281
a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st . louis to the moon , where there wouldn ' t even be any beer to drink .	87.0297
while he was at it , the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can ' t appreciate coexistence thru suicide .	178.21056
`` fools ' ' , he bayed , `` what do you think you are doing ' ' ? ?	25.712889
the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren ' t playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort .	85.228905
another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun .	84.46389
the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana , where , for some unknown reason , castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old ten o ' clock shadow .	82.09448
the plane was sent back to the united states , for a change , but castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution .	53.143703
less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castro ' s right hand man , che guevara , who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas , venezuela .	183.7106
the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen , who were on hand to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium .	142.84927
perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes , but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests , these things would not happen .	76.41965
the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev .	130.76779
pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it ' s getting dark down here and we ' re minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away .	189.12582
the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month .	63.601494
the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car .	180.83992
by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines .	82.734726
the board ' s action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws .	133.03397
word of dag hammarskjold ' s death in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe .	147.54855
as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously .	73.33435
it was on the eve of a momentous u . n . session to come to grips with cold war issues .	35.68994
mr . hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace .	126.415764
he had sought talks with moise tshombe , the secessionist president of congo ' s katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody .	222.6586
the story of the fatal crash is not fully known .	146.36821
the u . n . -chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired .	183.97536
whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined .	69.6056
the death of mr . hammarskjold removes the united nations ' most controversial leader .	128.03377
he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice .	66.119576
he courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc .	29.66449
the congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs .	41.337578
his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape .	41.68998
when the recent katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr . hammarskjold , despite the danger , flew to exert a calming influence .	100.10988
the u . n . session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing .	105.58873
it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments .	55.79909
if the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice .	77.3455
reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of greater miami ' s hardest tasks .	91.57236
even when public bodies arrived at a consensus , at least one dissenting vote has been usual .	155.18422
so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity .	42.501347
all nine members of the inter-american center authority voted for goodbody & company ' s proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center .	80.309555
the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract .	114.81618
if the indenture is accepted , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue .	230.24075
then goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15 . 5 million for developing the spacious graves tract to house the center .	36.299137
the next step awaits approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade county port authority .	100.15333
they allotted $500 , 000 three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arranged .	152.91656
less than half the sum has been spent , since the interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations .	171.83937
the balance is being budgeted for the coming year .	122.2125
it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed .	241.9676
the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8 . 5 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project .	60.807415
so have the people ' s elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels .	40.019146
interama , as it rises , will be a living monument to greater miami ' s ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises .	49.96823
progress , or lack of it , toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the united states commission on civil rights .	79.60516
much happened in this field during the past 12 months .	44.08239
each state advisory committee documented its own activity .	25.77775
some accounts are quite lengthy but florida ' s is the shortest of all , requiring only four paragraphs .	269.08414
`` the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas ' ' , reported this group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south floridians , william d . singer and john b . turner of miami .	139.77446
`` no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group .	108.67385
`` the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights ' ' .	85.22309
problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint .	72.21724
the progress reported by the advisory committee is real .	82.40631
while some think we move too fast and others too slowly , florida ' s record is a good one and stands out among the 50 .	147.7149
west germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on berlin and unification , with a coalition government .	95.584206
this is the key fact emerging from sunday ' s national election .	45.435272
chancellor adenauer ' s christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 .	96.20291
in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength .	117.62811
the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired .	96.839714
both willy brandt ' s social democrats , who gained 22 seats in the new parliament , and the free democrats , who picked up 23 , will insist on that before they enter the government .	101.49697
moon-faced ludwig erhart , the economic expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him .	485.44763
if he becomes chancellor , dr . erhart would make few changes .	131.09769
the wizard who fashioned west germany ' s astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise .	128.62488
he is dedicated to building the nation ' s strength and , as are all west germans , to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany .	116.26585
what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result .	100.67466
if the party of adenauer and erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of willy brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve .	54.760555
west berlin ' s mayor brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it .	108.54365
the free democrats ( 12 per cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union , and more dealings with the communist bloc .	46.883568
the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility .	284.58432
it could go either way , since the gains for both points of view were about the same .	99.354034
regardless of the decision two facts are clear .	5.7180033
west germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations .	225.634
and the career of konrad adenauer , who upheld germany ' s tradition of rock-like leaders which bismarck began , draws near the end .	298.829
americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing .	279.6481
but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn ' t want to make a spectacle of himself .	31.86646
for instance , so-called `` conservative ' ' organizations , some of them secret , are sprouting in the garden of joining where `` liberal ' ' organizations once took root .	141.15213
one specific example is a secret `` fraternity ' ' which will `` coordinate anti-communist efforts ' ' .	43.776756
the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled .	147.11012
according to the chicago tribune news service , state atty . gen . stanley mosk of california has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1 .	143.20802
does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ? ?	14.377637
does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ? ?	265.39346
does it put the label of un-american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically ? ?	309.05243
does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars , communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ? ?	64.00644
does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ? ?	68.13931
do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate ? ?	89.115425
in some instances a seventh question can be added 7 .	1065.1942
does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system ? ?	111.37194
if the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time .	60.627335
falling somewhere in a category between einstein ' s theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless -- is the tropical green `` city ' ' of islandia , a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents , limited access and an unlimited future .	177.93425
whatever land you can see here , from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward , belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land .	142.73653
and what you can ' t see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too .	59.8831
the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment .	99.372795
in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours .	187.07982
in this instance , happily , insistence is being made that our share is protected .	120.56317
and until this protection is at least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing .	276.0837
the reaction of certain city council members to california ' s newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing .	123.053375
we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide , and , therefore , had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public .	87.42104
in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the brown act , the legislature declares that `` the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people ' s business .	74.145676
it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly .	464.28967
`` the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them .	83.46775
the people , in delegating authority , do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know .	86.75802
the full implementation of these noble words , however , has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature .	50.03907
since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted , but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act .	126.52673
despite the lip service paid by local governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations .	103.83283
when all else fails , it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations .	465.50162
we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims .	39.02446
without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily .	365.20746
but the citizens would , of course , never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious .	182.7674
if the dominican republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the u . s . show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship .	49.7596
mr . balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .	191.80528
had u . s . warships not appeared off the dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war .	45.78216
ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba .	129.88354
within the organization of american states , there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously .	145.90718
but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo ' s waterfront shouting , `` vive yankees ' ' ! !	32.030632
more , the u . s . action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , dr . juan bosch , as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future ' ' .	109.1469
mr . balaguer ' s troubles are by no means over .	146.96974
he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike .	111.77398
in cooperating toward that objective , oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states .	47.789917
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 .	181.36205
now , as then , it is a matter of jobs .	158.83658
craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim , such as factory maintenance .	85.76766
the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members .	83.466
that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations .	56.062057
or that ' s what it looked like at the time .	13.3171625
but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs .	338.7575
walter reuther , leader of the industrial union faction of the afl-cio , says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor .	83.96367
whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as , say , jimmy hoffa of the teamsters , is a matter of conjecture .	52.93823
but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor .	639.432
engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor ' s family feuds .	171.94643
the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive .	93.6572
the army , navy and air force , among others , may question secretary freeman ' s claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the `` strongest deterrent ' ' to the spread of communism .	110.95684
but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the `` greatest single source of strength ' ' in the struggle to insure freedom around the world .	55.527966
mr . freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america ' s capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the soviet ' s successes in space .	150.42218
american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time .	142.30614
in fact , over the years , the american farmer ' s capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar .	181.19398
and thus far , mr . freeman has offered very little relief .	436.09116
the 1961 feed grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a billion dollar fiasco .	104.63188
in exchange for higher price supports , growers pledged reduction in planted acreage .	33.11407
but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer .	65.679184
the result $1 . 1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget .	36.31774
perhaps , as mr . freeman says , american agriculture may stop the communists , but it is also swindling the american taxpayer .	110.81159
a senate subcommittee headed by sen . jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions .	79.659355
the department needs a clearer `` sense of direction ' ' at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , sen . jackson says .	119.40547
the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department .	16.260672
president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance .	48.201576
but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first of all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes .	178.97238
nor does sen . jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy .	61.02728
this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates .	140.00652
but competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what sen . jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them ' ' .	114.01908
the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr . rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged , as sen . jackson puts it , `` in work that does not really need doing ' ' .	129.0166
mr . rusk should also draw comfort from sen . jackson ' s recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved .	66.40828
self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress .	44.82639
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist .	100.446556
but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends .	56.27171
james p . mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn ' t drop below three million a couple of years ago .	92.248505
he lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora .	30.649475
his successor , secretary goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months .	98.35069
no betting man , mr . goldberg says he ' s merely `` putting my neck out again ' ' by predicting the rate will go down this month .	191.21317
he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods .	108.09171
mr . mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated .	137.96138
mr . goldberg has less reason for missing .	12.108892
the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can ' t be blamed in november .	148.11899
the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary ' s neck may be spared .	41.453316
cambodia ' s chief of state , who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand , insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia .	122.393875
but so convinced of communism ' s inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel .	53.598026
`` i have to see the facts ' ' , is the way the prince puts it .	31.619806
and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western posture .	194.29501
prince sihanouk ' s powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions .	116.13764
commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington ' s economic forecasters .	100.707214
weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement .	54.76659
recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr . hodges ' appraisal , though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house .	54.1092
and now mr . hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point .	99.54647
he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .	58.77834
the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales .	33.913437
february ' s volume was 1 per cent above january ' s for the first pickup since last october , although it ' s still 1 . 5 per cent off from february 1960 .	98.1903
corroborating mr . hodges ' figures was the federal reserve board ' s report of the large sales increase in the nation ' s department stores for the week ending march 4 .	71.007835
in newark , for example , this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level .	107.83585
of course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 .	59.437572
another optimistic sign , this one from the labor department , was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments `` was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb . 25 ' ' .	87.00609
initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8 , 100 in the week ending march 4 .	61.056942
mr . hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn ' t think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes .	72.44812
well , we can ' t have everything .	24.032024
prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut .	57.971848
new jersey folk need not be told of the builder ' s march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain .	152.35876
now the stone harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state .	185.79895
against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline , the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant .	91.28441
but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves .	133.6411
the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30 , 000 acres of cape cod , from provincetown to chatham , is strengthened by president kennedy ' s interest in that area .	52.011578
but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country .	137.95824
by comparison , stone harbor bird sanctuary ' s allies seem less formidable , for aside from the audubon society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle egrets and the louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there .	142.12338
but there is hope , for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space .	248.56482
the desirability of preserving such places as the cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .	152.5605
public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing .	62.501377
much of the glamor president kennedy ' s peace corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent shriver , the head corpsman .	81.476555
anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to mr . shriver , get off the train right now .	103.4589
first of all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling .	10.377952
then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different .	171.56927
and the pay , of course , will be nil .	99.756645
despite all this , the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else .	192.04147
the study of the st . louis area ' s economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st . louis survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois countryside .	163.33562
st . louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region .	147.93475
slackened regional demand for st . louis goods and services reflects the region ' s relative lack of purchasing power .	91.51103
not all st . louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood .	75.16305
but for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core .	69.01231
the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois .	257.27393
gov . dalton ' s new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry .	103.95797
another would be to take the advice of dr . elmer ellis , president of the university of missouri , and provide for an impartial professional analysis of missouri ' s economy .	55.91455
he says the state , in order to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy .	93.040535
the research center of the university ' s school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr . ellis has been talking about .	140.03223
he and dean john w . schwada of the business school outlined the project at a recent conference .	99.708565
the university can make a valuable contribution to the state ' s economic development through such a study .	66.24837
in southern illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth .	43.098328
the carbondale industrial development corp . has obtained a $500 , 000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs .	171.03407
carbondale is in the herrin-murphysboro-west frankfort labor market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average .	32.935352
the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri ' s depressed areas , and in the long run that will benefit st . louis as well .	73.62766
politics-ridden st . clair county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development .	50.599606
more industrial acreage lies vacant in st . clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st . louis area .	70.14651
the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side .	91.97281
and then there is st . louis county , where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth .	111.78848
st . louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests .	202.60684
some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st . louis county doesn ' t want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lost .	79.52159
metropolitan st . louis ' s relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi .	61.74491
without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area ' s economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and st . louis will slip into second-class status .	49.269604
many of our very best friends are reformers .	3.9447668
still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far .	68.08705
take , for example , the reformers among new york city ' s democrats .	37.023876
having whipped mr . de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall , they have changed the name to chatham hall .	243.41147
even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick ? ?	98.40488
granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame , the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit .	90.26579
but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name .	58.8411
after all , it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-american , the days in which the sons of st . tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the british government , that is .	70.522606
further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ? ?	85.10114
they will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant .	198.46375
instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger ' s stripes are not black ? ?	90.335846
the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official , col . mariano faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration service .	156.1902
the faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds .	3.4962993
the kennedy administration had assured anti-castro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator batista .	50.780186
using a batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro .	151.1648
moreover , col . faget ' s information on cuba was too outdated to be useful in `` screening ' ' castro agents	143.81604
the colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power .	37.96034
and while he had headed batista ' s anti-communist section , the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be communists .	106.523224
responsibility for the faget appointment rests with gen . j . m . swing , an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service .	34.73016
gen . swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office .	62.53181
some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend , congressman walter of pennsylvania , at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get .	85.12464
congressman walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 .	43.469807
at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen . swing .	64.408775
the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat .	109.14034
as president , dwight d . eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics .	100.56556
as a former president , however , mr . eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new york republican rally , and generally missed his target .	203.9783
mr . eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a `` juvenile experiment ' ' and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon .	121.95199
nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad .	61.291615
his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding .	117.14522
the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of `` dollarette ' ' dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies .	218.89804
it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit .	25.642895
finally , mr . eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington .	69.36363
this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis , when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too .	127.575775
the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded .	134.27756
ex-presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words .	127.00693
some of former president truman ' s off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein .	244.06525
nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics , but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility .	102.82216
this is a matter of respect for the presidency .	231.40028
mr . eisenhower ' s new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship .	105.346924
the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable british service on the high seas .	51.216675
reports that the venerable liner , which has been in service since 1936 , was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us .	69.40691
but the cunard line , influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least .	178.24377
a new queen , with the prosaic title of q3 , had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary .	37.279366
the british government , concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry , had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling $50 , 400 , 000 toward the $84 , 000 , 000 cost of a new 75 , 000-ton passenger liner .	63.03596
since 1957 , more and more trans-atlantic passengers have been crossing by air .	197.88675
economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines .	72.72339
competition from other steamship lines has cut cunard ' s share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run .	144.91408
the cunard line has under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than 75 , 000 tons .	46.734444
this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months .	56.429276
also under consideration is an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to serve new york .	91.97606
the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation .	126.58454
gen . maxwell taylor ' s statement in saigon that he is `` very much encouraged ' ' about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to bolster the vietnamese army .	88.179695
gen . taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and , judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east , he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources .	64.93749
there was good reason for gen . taylor to make an inspection trip at this time .	68.0751
communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a new crisis .	58.539635
south viet nam ' s rice surplus for next year -- more than 300 , 000 tons -- may have been destroyed .	37.807358
the viet cong , the communist rebels , may have lost their stored grain and arms factories .	307.1928
the rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in november .	191.73907
nothing that is likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions .	197.21333
the indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 , when gen . ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing .	129.71729
it is a war to stay out of today , especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops .	109.81261
he may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming .	52.675423
south viet nam has received $1 , 450 , 000 , 000 in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b . johnson ' s visit last may .	68.95238
gen . taylor , the president ' s special military adviser , is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure .	166.44081
it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an asian morass .	81.28423
gov . john m . dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly , or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence .	128.78125
ambassador stevenson yesterday described the u . n . ' s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced ' ' .	58.474827
if the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as mr . stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill ' ' to a u . n . without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning .	59.1178
the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be , as the charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the organization ' ' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the organization ' ' .	70.027565
in other words , the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one .	162.46207
he should be , as dag hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .	66.00435
the charter does stipulate that `` due regard ' ' shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible ' ' .	61.89106
the united states and its allies have had no objection to this .	98.76764
what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold ' s death to turn the entire u . n . staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come .	83.45247
the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them .	58.8184
although the united states and the u . s . s . r . have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work .	56.77745
if any one of them has any power to veto the secretary general ' s decisions the nature of the organization will have changed .	68.26614
if they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the u . n . will not of necessity change .	88.08977
the secretary general must have , subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else ' s instructions .	73.31638
this is the root issue for which the united states should stand .	90.594406
we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography .	200.49481
what we must have , if the united nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation ' s direction and subservient to no single nation ' s ambition .	99.166695
the new city charter , which should get a yes vote as question no . 1 on nov . 7 , would not make a good mayor out of a bad one .	150.12767
there is no such magic in man-made laws .	6.5417595
but it would greatly strengthen any mayor ' s executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the board of estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy .	107.02305
lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor .	46.301632
thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative .	78.08226
the board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions .	68.64253
the board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget items , subject to the mayor ' s veto	169.27055
but the city council will now share fully this budget-altering power .	255.55922
overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council , and a two-thirds vote .	63.203964
the controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog ' ' functions	32.819263
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed .	31.300766
he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the finance department .	43.56582
on net balance , in spite of controller gerosa ' s opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office , the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now .	119.1234
borough presidents , while retaining membership in the board of estimate , lose their housekeeping functions .	72.957214
highways go to a new department of highways , sewers to the department of public works , such street cleaning as borough presidents now do ( in queens and richmond ) to the sanitation department .	91.6808
the expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department .	242.47429
the capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises	198.36157
but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds .	175.98456
a road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected .	195.49124
this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business	759.3896
enlargement of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow .	88.17945
the inter-american press association , which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn , is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years .	56.98043
the i . a . p . a . is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere	116.314705
and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution .	25.331835
as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime , more and more cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile .	61.40901
the i . a . p . a . found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before batista ' s dictatorship began in 1952 .	94.2901
freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances .	196.5929
this , in more diplomatic language , is what adlai stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government .	73.45209
he felt able to end on a note of hope .	22.800722
he sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms .	211.5776
no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american press association .	41.016808
the twenty-second soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced .	161.06355
according to the original program , premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the `` bold program for building communism in our time ' ' which the congress will adopt .	153.22101
but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by 1980 , the world is watching moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future .	158.15103
the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russia ' s progress painted by the communist party ' s program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier khrushchev ' s berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered .	91.84471
whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated .	126.56897
and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive .	137.13177
this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years .	83.31907
the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress , and the central committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job .	143.38547
dr . james b . conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer .	135.89415
his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change .	141.44702
now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including new york , has shattered this optimism .	79.59738
dr . conant has come away shocked and angry .	14.486684
his new book , entitled `` slums and suburbs ' ' , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster .	51.292847
there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr . conant ' s specific views .	84.22339
his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment .	145.06673
dr . conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality .	127.584114
his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend .	343.30353
but these are side issues to a powerful central theme .	52.907238
that theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk .	66.6008
it labels the slums , especially the negro slums , as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters .	72.89695
the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and dr . conant accuses employers and labor unions alike .	127.64789
the facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools , regardless of the color of their students .	134.54758
a call for action `` before it is too late ' ' has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures .	133.88417
dr . conant ' s conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation ' s gratitude .	80.95491
he has served in positions of greater glamour , both at home and abroad	80.49972
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools .	42.641438
a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail .	102.891754
he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers .	114.94463
in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress , each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district .	95.79189
this means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis .	170.91896
occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten .	125.54939
most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter .	177.10478
old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery .	31.480577
she had , she said , heard that the plant was closing .	65.90642
it couldn ' t close , she said .	7.8015685
she had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat .	930.3126
she had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear .	110.962814
she was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter .	136.0255
she had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food .	98.766945
this did not happen in counties of north georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land .	127.414185
nor in south georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields .	263.38782
this happened in decatur , dekalb county , not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian atlanta .	118.37822
and now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the dekalb county cannery .	25.35659
`` is it so the cannery is going to close ' ' ? ?	40.495823
o . n . moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , didn ' t know what to say .	112.54648
he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer .	42.347816
he did say he was out of cans , the no . 3 ' s , but `` i requisitioned 22 , 000 ' ' .	80.93985
he said he had no . 2 ' s enough to last two weeks more .	114.34849
threat of closing the cannery is a recent one .	263.68008
a three-man committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o . emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed .	52.13478
reason the cannery loses $3 , 000 yearly .	20.653717
but dekalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money .	33.622414
`` the cannery ' ' , said mrs . lewellyn lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the `` victory garden ' ' produce , `` is a service to the taxpayer .	115.60275
and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up .	89.80954
`` the county , though , seems more interested in those people who don ' t even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food ' ' .	130.19463
a driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a . m . finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , `` what in the world will we do ' ' ? ?	78.88867
`` what in the world ' ' , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , `` will any of us do ' ' ? ?	122.72897
moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn ' t believe it will close .	74.53888
but he is in the middle , an employe of dekalb , but on the side of the people .	37.410664
`` don ' t ask me if i think the cannery helps ' ' , he said .	12.62034
`` sir , i know the cannery helps ' ' .	3.9013042
most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard .	413.65765
when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say , `` just forget it ' ' .	49.93886
a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge .	143.8716
i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades .	111.8402
one night , at the close of the evening service , he came forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god .	118.032646
after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land .	128.1379
`` we tried to settle this dispute ' ' , he said , `` but could never come to an agreement .	31.00098
i settled it tonight ' ' , he continued .	206.40704
`` i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor ' ' .	42.959393
forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god .	65.27343
you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart .	65.0334
henry van dyke said , `` forgive and forget if you can	77.02915
we must , first of all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure god ' s forgiveness .	44.465336
`` for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive -- your trespasses ' ' .	104.07825
it will do no good to seek god ' s forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong .	101.484344
then , jesus indicated that god ' s forgiveness is unlimited .	134.05038
in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , `` forgive us our debts ' ' .	68.91011
when a person meets god ' s requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven .	65.04593
god ' s mercy and patience will last forever .	21.581171
forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by god ' s love .	65.97084
it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past .	43.833237
we want the past forgiven , but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future .	54.150833
finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us .	213.56764
once peter asked , `` how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? ?	59.889183
jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven ' ' .	36.39724
jesus not only taught forgiveness , he gave us an example of it on the cross .	54.335682
with all the energy of his broken body he prayed , `` father , forgive them , for they know not what they do ' ' .	70.315254
she ' s been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she ' s still a teen-ager who looks like a baby , she is getting married .	78.63967
her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said .	153.85135
for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldn ' t have made myself heard if i ' d had the equivalent of the message to garcia .	56.669693
but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute .	112.15748
`` how do you know you love somebody enough to get married ' ' ? ?	27.40534
it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked how can you be sure ? ?	86.95309
`` aren ' t you sure ' ' ? ?	4.450464
i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important .	176.91142
but if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage .	348.076
besides , in all honesty , i don ' t know how you can be sure .	12.086087
i don ' t know any secret recipe for certainty .	17.372662
in the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured .	138.13925
i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth .	121.81129
`` does he ever bore you ' ' ? ?	4.0441933
why , he ' s so darling and ' '	28.654682
`` i mean ' ' , i went on ruthlessly , `` when he ' s not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting ? ?	117.49677
does he care about things that matter to you ? ?	14.697637
can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ? ?	237.51382
because , honey , i thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you ' re hopelessly stranded , together .	66.746445
and if you bore each other then , heaven help you .	307.43622
she came back the other day to reassure me .	6.2108665
she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting .	45.507225
she asked if i had other advice and , heady with success , i rushed it in , i hope not too late .	458.51047
jokes , cartoons and cynics to the contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends .	303.74887
i do not know dr . wilson sneed well .	1660.2183
but i was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st . luke ' s church in atlanta .	45.32324
it was the cry of not just one heart	7982.6396
it spoke for many in the clergy , i suspect .	49.784203
imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church .	205.7892
`` such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments ' ' , he told his members .	75.5468
a minister should not stay `` beyond the time that his leadership should benefit ' ' his church , he wrote , `` for he becomes ordinary .	141.64262
and so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when `` i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you ' ' .	112.20851
his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister , a modest methodist , who said `` i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and i would have it no other way and it is unworthy to think of self .	99.96105
but oh , how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself ' ' .	63.701626
a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving .	125.43905
he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach .	112.86388
the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity .	172.15997
theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards .	3.1623003
yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul .	174.55052
we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and god ' s .	85.65049
we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week , american cash .	219.1509
if we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins .	166.93208
if he won ' t break , we add to the stress he bears .	239.60173
and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to .	120.11147
we expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be .	99.05011
we expect bestowal of god ' s love through him .	76.54794
the church truly is not a rest home for saints , but a hospital for sinners .	66.86724
yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers , too .	90.3991
mr . podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake .	122.997826
the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure .	151.55107
the evening was not always spent in the same way .	25.607143
this year , on a night cool with the front of september moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod .	203.26117
the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages .	96.05564
in the midst of it all , mr . podger came out on the pod porch , alone .	51.30187
he had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize .	42.954643
the prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging .	171.75581
mrs . podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .	160.22417
mr . podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it .	100.61362
he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him .	53.81598
suddenly one young voice rose above the others .	19.716051
`` but ' ' , it said , `` do you always know when you ' re happy ' ' ? ?	30.738585
the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in mr . podger ' s mind .	82.00602
here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , mr . podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace .	162.1791
it had begun with the blue jay feather .	33.675945
walking along the lake before breakfast , mr . podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight .	68.62558
the winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood .	462.04248
the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .	81.88907
all day long mr . podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield .	87.95852
would a blue feather in a man ' s hat make him happy all day ? ?	326.78668
but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake .	69.248924
then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it .	47.884666
and there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road .	193.57574
it was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr . podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car .	150.4191
would he take pains to avoid it ? ?	1.0217978
taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , mr . podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness .	119.73742
the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .	154.92535
but mr . podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .	49.73333
here in the cool darkness mr . podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight .	133.87415
for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .	169.88063
the three would never meet again , but for some reason or other mr . podger was sure he would always remember the incident .	190.2483
at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr . podger ' s hammock purchase .	54.10574
`` i like them things , too ' ' , he had said .	13.216385
if you ' re lyin ' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap ' em right over you .	134.24306
i do it , lots o ' times -- i like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it ' s all quiet .	71.68522
the wind moves it a little bit -- you know .	50.717846
mr . podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice .	74.0608
as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , mr . podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet .	105.78875
alacrity , the podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up .	197.45195
she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and mr . podger took her inside the fringe .	54.157883
soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod .	85.06707
mr . podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out .	78.47433
`` it ' s getting so chilly we ' ve lighted a fire , and we ' re going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one .	68.3161
why are you out here all by yourself ? ?	5.026762
mr . podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire .	136.2106
`` of course i am ' ' , he said .	8.045882
i just came out here to know it ' ' .	2.8847086
as the south begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region ' s slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools .	124.979805
desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities -- dallas and atlanta .	74.52835
in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment .	97.38255
these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully .	39.303562
the programs do not take sides on the issue itself .	709.28687
they point out simply that `` it is the law of the land ' ' .	10.842903
the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation .	77.11265
even better , they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs .	68.25033
in each case there was an initial act of violence .	15.800769
in houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes , none of which were serious .	103.442375
in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents .	76.49672
the nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south .	156.03009
it is a `` stair-step ' ' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade .	75.63792
each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated .	370.29184
the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now ' ' .	63.803825
the program has worked well in both nashville and houston .	7.847812
it met a serious rebuff in new orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents .	98.41253
another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program .	49.972412
generally , throughout the south , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met .	137.82666
perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas .	134.60983
during the summer , negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments .	52.88778
it was part of a citywide move toward full integration .	92.96178
so successful has been this program , worked out by white and negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months .	47.046535
hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars .	77.29775
already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis .	61.352085
several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .	49.82208
this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of dallas .	80.84288
it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south .	124.86335
southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights .	62.572018
they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots .	206.06335
all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it .	287.30225
business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence .	81.648575
they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .	143.65921
in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way .	52.753082
and as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up .	83.86939
this co-operation has emboldened other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation .	98.95479
they realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise .	104.33315
since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago , i ' ve been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship .	56.53876
played mostly on the freeways around los angeles , it goes like this	119.83172
a driver cruising easily at 70 m . p . h . in lane a of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead .	152.05008
traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into lane b , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m . p . h . .	101.844574
the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him .	142.30742
he can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a	138.30482
( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes	226.32031
or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair .	112.6847
the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access .	305.29782
whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , i don ' t know .	19.085955
but it is done , consistently and i ' m both surprised and impressed .	121.949554
this could never happen in my native chicago .	14.357522
there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood .	59.11992
in chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back .	145.17233
failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly .	95.273735
this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to southern california drivers .	90.88023
at the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at marshall field and company , i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype .	147.30533
after three months of research , i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i ' ve ever encountered .	113.932076
during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .	109.87896
an out-of-town writer came up to paul richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year .	210.49924
now richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go .	205.42487
he can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa .	16.759594
this happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece .	66.50084
`` it ' s a whole lot easier ' ' , he said , `` to increase the population of nevada , than it is to increase the population of new york city ' ' .	49.779797
and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher .	205.15764
`` that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote ' ' , said the writer , scratching his head .	51.71691
`` now , if i can just figure out what he ' s talking about , i ' ll use it ' ' .	53.660465
this was just richard ' s way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open .	185.10945
some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs .	206.6085
it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it hasn ' t worked that way .	139.97234
this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one .	195.37158
you ' d never guess it from the way they ' ve played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 .	98.45219
obviously , if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league , it will have to show improvement someplace .	107.483635
where can that improvement possibly come from ? ?	1.3102754
you certainly can ' t expect the infield to do any better than it did last year .	125.26087
brooks robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he ' ll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 .	133.46146
you can ' t expect it , though .	77.71819
robby ' s performance last year was tremendous .	16.40834
it ' s the same with ron hansen and jim gentile .	26.177685
if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint .	103.255554
they shouldn ' t be asked to carry any more of the burden .	70.25423
hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back .	368.2361
he got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably won ' t duplicate it .	113.253914
there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year .	355.45166
they don ' t expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat .	246.00528
he ' ll still be a top player , they concede , because he ' s got a great glove and the long ball going for him .	85.08373
but they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production .	73.555305
gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs .	42.07369
i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch .	10.674838
but even so , he had a good year in 1960 and won ' t do too much better .	72.5755
so , all in all , the infield can ' t be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first .	114.672386
and the pitching will also have trouble doing better .	39.266827
richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season .	203.76299
where , then , can we look for improvement ? ?	143.5491
`` from triandos , brandt and walker ' ' , answers richards .	210.51129
`` they ' re the ones we can expect to do better ' ' .	20.609592
the man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons .	127.54189
triandos hasn ' t proved it yet , but he says he ' s convinced his thumb is all right .	154.76971
he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury hasn ' t bothered him .	50.95508
if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively .	163.2587
i ' m still not convinced , though , i ' ll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him .	77.98197
hank foiles , backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors , make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year , but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant .	241.16728
to me , brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year .	84.862144
he hasn ' t played too much , because richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice .	66.519516
he ' s hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year .	77.928635
when he came to baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club .	89.62613
he was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field .	147.19586
as of now , that all seems behind him .	36.484955
he ' s been entirely different all spring .	11.202209
and walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year .	121.76814
let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff .	128.43495
so , if the orioles are to improve , brandt , triandos and walker will have to do it .	65.70609
so far the platoons on left and right fielders don ' t seem capable of carrying the load .	134.59712
of course , this isn ' t taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city , but it ' s the way things look from here at this point .	61.291847
is the mother of an `` autistic ' ' child at fault ? ?	52.687393
( the `` autistic ' ' child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self .	55.696243
he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people .	128.83044
) did his mother make him this way ? ?	9.388998
we believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn .	97.218216
a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties .	118.40594
sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them .	133.32724
but we don ' t think she creates them .	33.873875
we don ' t think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic .	235.77101
the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem .	87.92354
since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we ' d like to share one experienced mother ' s comments .	168.33885
as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , i have to manipulate my son ' s fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy .	73.59656
he wants me to do everything for him .	4.9649773
`` you don ' t believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them .	116.35598
but i do and my psychiatrist does , too .	107.582794
i know , that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction .	334.67294
`` one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned .	277.41498
this is that autistic people don ' t enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and i .	130.07777
when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board .	193.16791
he pushes and straightens himself as if he can ' t stand the feeling of being held .	152.32649
physical contact is uncomfortable for him ' ' ! !	18.588211
as a rule , the autistic child doesn ' t enjoy physical contact with others .	30.239988
parents have to find other ways of comforting him .	101.20652
for the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement .	180.87347
as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his `` magic ' ' thing ) .	128.74706
or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick .	327.4821
the answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer .	78.59634
`` dear doctors we learned this year that our older son , daniel , is autistic .	133.97926
we did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to .	113.435455
fortunately , there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children .	50.18647
`` i try to treat daniel as if he were normal , though of course i realize he is far from that at present .	137.03986
what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible .	90.647385
i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible .	96.535934
`` what is your experience with autistic children ? ?	24.701963
how do they turn out later ' ' ? ?	5.1561766
many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives .	74.58481
certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood .	172.75989
-- a first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything -- sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc . .	82.52417
when different colors are used , she is just as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc . .	119.3007
the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color .	363.53046
should i show my daughter how things should be colored ? ?	52.50635
is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? ?	49.90238
-- her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects .	143.38383
this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade .	60.957592
no , coloring isn ' t exactly something you teach a child .	160.89545
you sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines .	160.68753
but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration .	105.50141
seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art embroidery .	113.42216
possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed .	96.49557
just as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery .	104.99397
one such , in fact , is a rug .	811.4602
though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background .	207.80533
the twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england .	110.3207
traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country .	108.822876
the work is executed in england ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color .	154.67313
among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color .	80.27368
for a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine english chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically chinese-inspired design of this revered eighteenth century period .	134.74025
since the work is done by hand , the only limitation , it is said , `` is that of human conception ' ' .	46.872257
modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of this trend .	57.37117
these have never gone out of style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts .	219.47412
an amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking up her living room color scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room .	145.83388
california democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards .	135.72874
and they ' re confident that the gop , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine .	132.28267
their meeting at san francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the california democratic council directorate .	75.337654
but it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people ' ' .	68.48416
-- plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in los angeles next december that would enlist top-drawer democrats from all over the country .	65.52487
-- blueprints for doubling the cdc ' s present 55 , 000 enrollment .	87.69919
-- arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in fresno next jan . 26-28 .	185.09082
-- and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state ' s 38 new congressional districts .	72.28304
at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox , 39-year-old amateur politico , thomas b . carvey jr . , whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircraft ' s moon missiles .	260.49295
he ' s approached his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion .	68.87874
viewed from afar , the cdc looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so .	245.11702
much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer ' ' democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the aj .	105.02262
moreover , the entire state democratic hierarchy , from gov . brown on down to the county chairmen , also participates in this huge operation .	200.58298
contrarily , republican `` volunteers ' ' go their separate ways , and thus far have given no indication that they ' d be willing to join forces under a single directorate , except in the most loose-knit fashion .	94.84444
carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase cdc membership .	339.4641
where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth .	309.2031
biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting up cdc units in rock-ribbed democratic territory .	372.11356
paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party ' s favor , strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis .	164.27832
like most democratic spokesmen , carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously `` partisan year ' ' .	68.48698
hence the attention they ' re lavishing on the aj .	31.65834
in all probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress , and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites .	102.292046
this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who don ' t see eye-to-eye with the aj .	198.15434
naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council .	139.83926
shunted aside by the rampant organizers for john f . kennedy last year , who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential campaign , the cdc plainly intends to provide the party ' s campaign muscle in 1962 .	53.769997
there is evidence that it will be happily received by gov . brown and the other constitutional incumbents .	147.19734
carvey considers that former vice president nixon would be brown ' s most formidable foe , with ex-gov . knight a close second .	176.97057
but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants don ' t worry him very much .	117.96085
in his cdc work , carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of california ' s shrewdest political strategists former democratic national committeeman paul ziffren , who backed him over a northland candidate espoused by atty . gen . stanley mosk .	90.28933
( significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw mosk moving into the national committee post over ziffren are still audible in party circles .	127.41485
note we ' ve just received an announcement of the 54th assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention wednesday night in south pasadena ' s war memorial bldg . , which graphically illustrates the cdc ' s broad appeal .	93.565384
state and county committeemen , cdc directors and representatives , members of 16 area clubs , and `` all residents ' ' have been invited .	79.23117
this is going to be a language lesson , and you can master it in a few minutes .	50.998005

once you learn how to translate communese , much of each day ' s deluge of news will become clearer .	151.41917
at least , i have found it so .	42.063847
for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated dr . freud , communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves .	188.50963
they accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty .	246.6987
president kennedy ' s latest warning to the communist world that the united states will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was , somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the iron curtain .	148.52841
then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency .	159.46448
moscow radio from the literary gazette in english to england	49.454845
`` president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals , to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism .	64.942665
evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the west have been planned long in advance .	129.30563

tass datelined los angeles , in english to europe	736.9736
`` former vice president nixon came out in support of president kennedy ' s program for stepping up the arms race .	44.295265
he also demanded that kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension specifically to crush the cuban revolution , resume nuclear testing , resist more vigorously admission of china to its lawful seat in the united nations , and postpone non-military programs at home ' ' .	89.2633
`` the american press clamored for many days promising president kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the united states .	65.420876
in fact , the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current president .	71.48232
if there were no west berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the united states and its nato partners .	85.37782
washington apparently decided to use an old formula , by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the u . s . economy after a prolonged slump ' ' .	78.081955
`` the u . s . president has shown once again that the united states needs the fanning of the west berlin crisis to justify the armaments race .	47.444904
as was to be expected kennedy ' s latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in bonn , where officials of the west german government praised it ' ' .	71.025375
`` u . s . pressure on britain to foster war hysteria over the status of west berlin has reached its apogee .	112.59044
the present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary britons shows that this british common sense is unwilling to pull somebody else ' s chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures ' ' .	136.84683
east berlin ( communist ) radio in german to germany	329.342
`` a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech .	122.52695
kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty .	153.62556
whenever some washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn .	105.390434
in kennedy ' s speech are cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the president ' s advisers and the political and economic forces behind them .	55.213318
well , dear listeners , despite all the shouting , there will be no war over west berlin ' ' .	33.033688
`` chairman khrushchev received the u . s . president ' s disarmament adviser , john mccloy .	25.892996

now , to translate from the communese , this means	257.3328
the `` west berlin ' ' crisis is really an east berlin crisis .	218.08311
the crisis was artificially stirred up by the kremlin ( wall street ) and the red army ( pentagon ) egged on by the west germans ( east germans ) .	79.39856
the reason was to speed up domestic production in the ussr , which khrushchev promised upon grabbing power , and try to end the permanent recession in russian living standards .	101.29555
chairman khrushchev ( kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position .	53.1546

aug . 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after benjamin franklin founded the pennsylvania gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening post .	107.07026
the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c . atkinson and charles alexander , who had just taken over franklin ' s old paper , desired a more distinctive name .	156.4032
when founded by franklin the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction , poetry , and literary essays .	243.48009
in the middle of the century , with a circulation of 90 , 000 , the post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country .	27.519772
but during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 cyrus h . k . curtis purchased it -- `` paper , type , and all ' ' -- for $1 , 000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany , and with only some 2 , 000 subscribers .	154.93622
little more than a fine old name , valuable principally because of the franklin tradition , the saturday evening post was slow to revive .	98.308304
but curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country .	44.47741

the 350th anniversary of the king james bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament , the first part of the new english bible , undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english .	49.413525
since it was issued in the spring of 1611 , the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible .	110.1445
however , biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced .	104.985825

the new english bible ( the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version , but , as its cover states , it is offered `` simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship ' ' .	94.30993
time , of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose .	121.14608
bible reading , even more so than good classical music , grows in depth and meaning upon repetition .	255.76367
if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the king james version .	176.60866
however , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars .	111.23591
one is impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english , and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james .	50.67423
for example , in the third chapter of matthew , verses 13-16 , describing the baptism of jesus , the 1611 version reads	70.92344
`` then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .	191.42975
`` but john forbad him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ? ?	85.67397
`` and jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness .	249.12703
`` and jesus , when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove , and lighting upon him ' ' .	67.31708
certainly , the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings , in the new english bible which reads `` then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee , and he came to john to be baptized by him .	68.87056
' do you come to me ' ? ?	1.0354502
' i need rather to be baptized by you .	393.65707
jesus replied , ' let it be so for the present	66.12809
we do well to conform this way with all that god requires .	124.28739
after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once , and at that moment heaven opened	179.68562
he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him ' '	51.753025
( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version .	63.11738
among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes and yet so few persons , other than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount .	134.85056
to illustrate , the first blessing in the king james bible reads `` blessed are the poor in spirit	132.7887
for their ' s is the kingdom of heaven ' ' .	11.820852
the new version states `` how blest are those who know that they are poor	59.38321
the kingdom of heaven is theirs ' ' .	2.173667
some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the english language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar .	95.161766
in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase `` angel of the church ' ' which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop .	66.9141
for the most part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ .	113.837845
originally recorded by hand , these words have been copied and recopied , translated and retranslated through the ages .	31.648724
discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church fathers , in themselves called for a restudy of the bible .	125.105736
to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth .	185.83899
with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic .	149.69562
the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england , church of scotland , methodist church , congregational union , baptist union , presbyterian church of england , churches in wales , churches in ireland , society of friends , british and foreign bible society and national society of scotland .	56.103317
prof . c . h . dodd , 76 , a congregational minister and a leading authority on the new testament , is general director of the project and chairman of the new testament panel .	57.51179
sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet .	216.49413
that is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes .	101.09077
there are many soft and light shoe leathers available .	195.88669
many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers .	91.61896
styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape .	68.21164
heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette .	8.713077
wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights .	120.653175
stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes .	27.781204
just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps .	49.42109
while white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color .	98.315765
in the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures .	77.66977
don ' t overlook the straws this year .	25.718927
they come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors .	104.93902
in the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles .	103.81941
for added comfort some of the italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning .	93.01929
the citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot .	75.65722
orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac .	148.2237
in a brighter nautical vein is ille de france blue .	785.4988
spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan .	60.813274
designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated .	25.742811
at the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture .	31.954378
in a lacey open weave shoes have a luster finish , braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat .	59.960503
at right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather .	119.63075
an electric toothbrush ( broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the american bathroom .	80.82939
the brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth .	110.25264
in addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the underwriters laboratories , which means it is safe .	63.39569
the unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in .	195.62459
the speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor .	135.84938
the brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own .	82.84297
most of us brush our teeth by hand .	6.891912
the same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men .	158.33281
the electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend .	108.15915
in addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth .	79.37577
the bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel .	121.90263
it is conceivable that broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly .	58.534138
several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device .	40.68973
the results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly .	142.07033
the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy .	102.68472
but for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury .	106.380035
it is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles .	48.5298
since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique .	129.08908
writes does numbness in the left hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain tumor ? ?	616.84644
this is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand .	311.82306
the pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand .	40.499607
writes do steam baths have any health value ? ?	17.58655
no , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder .	75.97475
an ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same .	118.938194
writes what makes my hands numb when sewing ? ?	28.369287
there are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders .	105.479324
this manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer ' s cramp .	128.03535
writes does a brace help in sciatica ? ?	1.0751762
a back brace might help , depending upon the cause of sciatica .	59.271442
writes does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ? ?	73.23263
the cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body .	20.251059
it is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish .	148.6924
the latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed .	69.14898
the gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue .	264.66223
there ' s more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as thomas alva edison ' s first experiment in recorded sound .	149.38474
edison could hardly have guessed , however , that sophocles would one day appear in stereo .	423.78683
if the record buyer ' s tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records .	137.02966
and he will avoid eye-strain in the process .	25.934374
everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable .	257.6513
for sheer ambition , take the decca series titled modestly `` wisdom ' ' .	25.365509
volumes one and two , selected from the sound tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise men of our day ' ' .	115.9569
these sages include poet carl sandburg , statesman jawaharlal nehru and sculptor jacques lipchitz , in volume one , and playwright sean o ' casey , david ben-gurion , philosopher bertrand russell and the late frank lloyd wright in the second set .	64.71459
hugh downs is heard interviewing wright , for an added prestige fillip .	134.44894
there ' s more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by dover publications .	63.662117
dover `` publishes ' ' what the company calls `` listen and learn ' ' productions designed to teach foreign languages .	130.16594
previous presentations have been on french , spanish , russian , italian , german and japanese .	76.79623
but the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist ' s desire to visit the `` smaller , less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries ' ' , and is now prepared to teach modern greek and portuguese through recordings .	59.150795
the respective vocabularies `` essential for travel ' ' are available in separate albums .	49.757336
thanks to spoken arts records , history buffs may hear lincoln ' s `` most memorable speeches and letters ' ' in a two-disc set , interpreted by lincoln authority and lecturer roy p . basler .	184.08768
as a contemporary bonus , the set includes carl sandburg ' s address at a joint session of congress , delivered on lincoln ' s birthday two years ago .	48.971077
for those who `` like poetry but never get around to reading it ' ' , the library of congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work .	112.29233
the program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the recording laboratory of the library of congress , washington 25 , d . c . .	52.199226
newest on the list are john ciardi , w . d . snodgrass , i . a . richards , oscar williams , robert hillyer , john hall wheelock , stephen vincent benet , edwin muir , john peal bishop and maxwell bodenheim .	45.699398
two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above .	152.96645
decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction .	47.111782
rca victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` adventures in music ' ' , which is an instructional record library for elementary schools .	83.67757
howard mitchell and the national symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two .	146.77751
in an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future , herbert a . leggett , banker-editor of the phoenix `` arizona progress ' ' , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties .	139.97014
one of the roughest was the tv quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes .	118.284325
though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed american .	114.70088
but the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2 , 000 , 000 profit on the stock market .	131.61047
every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb .	118.78273
investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough .	164.21605
people who take us for suckers are like the westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull ' s-eye achievements .	65.106125
the promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it .	58.306377
he just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull ' s-eye .	54.14537
one of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication .	70.8607
if his mother loves him , he clings to that love as a ballast .	157.79926
he wants mommy to think him a good boy .	89.38256
he doesn ' t want her to look frowningly at him , or speak to him angrily .	138.59497
he wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother ' s little helper .	36.96476
but even mother ' s loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior .	105.41586
his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother ' s love for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them .	62.213634
his own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed .	108.785675
it won ' t develop until he has words with which to clothe it .	524.0818
what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ?	51.554935
the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be .	229.90976
she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child .	102.03055
if he can ' t play with mommy ' s magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own .	86.93999
if daddy ' s books are out of bounds his own picture books are not .	150.0463
toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .	52.813522
during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child ' s conscience .	53.61146
she tells him of the consequences of his behavior .	55.986458
if he bites a playmate she says , `` danny won ' t like you ' ' .	45.01976
if he snatches a toy , she says , `` caroline wants her own truck just as you do ' ' .	88.68779
there is no use trying to `` explain ' ' to a 2-year-old .	23.65051
remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior .	224.73903
substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act .	193.45671
he won ' t submit to his natural desires all the time , and it ' s mother ' s love that is responsible for his good behavior .	60.345837
this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` homecoming day ' ' .	131.41562
they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes .	91.51011
the football opponent on homecoming is , of course , selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperor ' s lions .	113.05466
it is true , of course , the uncertainties of life being what they are , that as now and then the christian killed the lion , homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team .	161.65022
even with all possible precaution , homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them .	196.38031
more often than not , as the old grad wanders along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain .	101.73769
he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall .	89.03477
it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates , faces alight , holding hands and talking happily as they come along , oblivious of him , or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances , such as they would give a tethered goat .	131.20012
usually , they titter loudly after they have passed by .	503.26144
he feels , suddenly , the weight of the fat that is on him .	86.38064
his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous .	18.826319
his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walked for miles , instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths .	84.111015
bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth .	568.3285
it is not much better if he meets with old classmates .	73.28818
too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by .	189.4804
he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said , on returning from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn ' t even recognize him .	104.69073
if they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon is done .	213.24342
after all , when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children , and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it .	249.86679
by then one begins to notice the middle-age spread	1130.5886
the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that are too thin or too heavy	251.09567
the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then , it is time to break it up and move on .	98.58358
it is , if anything , worse on the old player	131.71544
he sits in the stands and he doesn ' t like that .	26.454649
enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd .	105.7245
on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him .	121.37511
in the stands he is lonely and lost , no matter how many are about him .	97.83347
he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped	112.94824
the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants	20.328356
the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face .	18.26432
and so , he squirms with each play , remembering his youth .	91.876595
no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recaptured again .	78.15821
since the obvious is not always true , the republican national committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities .	98.40108
of 40 cities with populations of 300 , 000 and more , mr . kennedy carried 26 and mr . nixon 14 .	78.61489
there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election .	138.3591
these are new york , pennsylvania , michigan , maryland , missouri , new jersey , illinois and minnesota .	25.313799
in 1952 mr . eisenhower won all but missouri .	75.9041
yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to mr . kennedy .	26.826439
republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia .	12.242749
mr . nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so .	36.662132
his visit to warsaw , poland , after the russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial .	105.80242
yet , the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr . nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` polish ' ' vote	122.7518
30 per cent of the `` irish ' ' vote , and 18 per cent of the `` negro ' ' vote .	43.34294
a gop `` task force ' committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities .	121.97601
the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders .	92.58558
these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr . kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment .	66.51819
this error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one ' ' , and not a reality .	82.17845
the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical .	320.3953
they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor goldberg as politics , which the gop declared it to be .	122.83904
the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery .	235.70615
senator mundt ' s gross distortion of president eisenhower ' s conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy as too left wing , a statement mr . eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case in point .	93.98904
if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities .	117.17534
the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt , goldwater , bridges , dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s .	74.18234
in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr . hoover , and the party ' s failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash .	82.4768
the republican party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble .	114.94305
farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` hoover carts ' ' .	2.256782
smokers reduced to `` the makings ' ' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` hoover dust ' ' .	108.70189
one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasn ' t meant to repeat this error .	66.11708
but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john f . kennedy .	113.44644
that this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nation ' s business .	52.662037
the most articulate republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at mr . kennedy , already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care .	104.12973
if they also defeat the school bill , the gop task force won ' t have much research to do .	204.12894
it will early know why the party won ' t win back city votes .	136.82823
the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider .	99.766914
the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner .	88.8114
after the griffin-byrd political troup has completed the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history .	105.79046
every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions .	124.66025
hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever .	443.0004
and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor ' s race ' ' ? ?	44.242813
how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt . gov . garland byrd ' s senate committee on government operations ? ?	41.16673
the situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governor ' s race forward a few months , causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual .	173.31128
but when former gov . marvin griffin and lt . gov . byrd accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november , the situation was aggravated .	74.75358
neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation .	33.70386
to have refused would have been political suicide .	8.687466
and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast aside .	418.93646
the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates .	63.65198
it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the `` serious candidates ' ' .	33.66208
but state party chairman james gray of albany said no , and he didn ' t mince any words .	57.8714
`` they are just asking too much ' ' , he said .	5.598062
we can ' t think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either .	139.10597
`` if an opponent accuses you of lying , don ' t deny it .	30.075693
say he is a horse thief ' ' , runs an old adage .	101.822
if either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end .	158.59456
griffin ' s rural roads authority and byrd ' s 60 , 000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper ' s oaths .	47.48675

the providence journal editorial ( jan . 25 ) entitled `` east greenwich faces a housing development problem ' ' points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours .	139.94919
your suggested solution , it seems to me , is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning .	167.84216
first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested .	142.16533
this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town .	84.14298
the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come .	33.58698
this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither `` to halt an influx of migrants ' ' nor are we `` setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites ' ' .	188.75114
what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development .	59.020344
it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs .	196.48073
bostitch , inc . is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax .	52.4565
the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory .	107.29862
the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars .	55.73538
with our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant ' ' as the best way to meet these problems .	71.583115
in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure .	161.32527
as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow .	183.8553
mr . richard preston , executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission , in his remarks to the governors conference on industrial development at providence on october 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said `` if this is the fundamental reason for a community ' s interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain ' ' .	87.90325
he went on to say `` in the first place , industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities .	121.51056
it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be ' ' .	188.89493
while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth .	137.68182
we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year .	255.39526
it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase .	131.49254
if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning , what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage ? ?	139.99619
where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials ? ?	133.6081
i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life .	58.011497
the `` fruitful course ' ' of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called .	116.7945
the east greenwich police department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department , thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut area of the two communities .	133.6794
the east greenwich fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich .	73.39848
the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money , as do other kent county communities , for the support of the kent county memorial hospital , a regional facility .	59.425076
the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment .	50.77728
feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick , as reported in your newspapers , suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east greenwich .	102.704605
east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves .	138.36847
the education program for retarded children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community .	97.766266
i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich .	86.51012
i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts	248.3306
and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised .	70.58464
these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in what manner the community shall grow .	514.94696
we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions .	220.93333
until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny .	98.60031
i would like very much , on behalf of my husband and myself , to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the gabrielle fund .	107.506134

a few weeks ago , i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston .	124.70359
the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over , and must not be going to high school to attend these classes .	139.85733
the following week , i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade .	191.74483
i wish you could see the situation as i see it .	43.979458
if russian pupils have to take these languages , how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language , but have to face so many exceptions ? ?	115.18457
i do not think that america is like russia , not in the least ! !	132.00493
i am proud of my country , the small city i live in , my wonderful parents , my friends and my school	231.5283
but i am also a young , able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough .	166.53456
then people wonder why russian pupils are more advanced than american students .	119.66676
at the height of the first snowstorm we had , it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency .	112.688835
however , the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation .	158.98987
words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me .	132.04056
the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful .	67.96337
the rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather .	83.98576
had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did , perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time .	59.08579
the providence sunday journal article ( jan . 29 ) asking whether american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news .	112.002174
usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page .	72.25279
on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service .	57.08448
it can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later .	132.24255
there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter va hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected .	308.2612
no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years .	87.65007
the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public .	134.34584
i believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals .	34.54214
but i don ' t believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients .	335.33908
this matter is of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at least serious injuries , for many veterans .	42.309425
some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long .	90.54034
there ' s a reason for this length of stay .	18.04692
first of all , the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient .	71.92626
he has no experience with this veteran ' s previous medical record .	251.58813
if the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient .	61.241016
as a result , it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient .	41.555515
secondly , the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital , he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient .	61.088623
so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery .	45.62948
the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization .	25.280863
the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other .	120.73024
the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital .	86.44686
an adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals .	279.43433
it seems that open season upon veterans ' hospitalization is once more upon us .	260.79932
the american medical association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer .	103.75216
do they , the a . m . a . , offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world ? ?	233.39339
we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness .	114.32635
nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the a . m . a . on the health problem confronting the aged .	88.51896
they opposed the forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction	114.33338
yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate .	282.5903
-- no doubt there have been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration , exasperation , exhaustion , and even panic .	88.38054
but no president ever before referred to his as a `` lousy job ' ' ( as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen . barry goldwater ) .	85.53283
during his aggressive campaign to win his present position , mr . kennedy was vitriolic about this country ' s `` prestige ' ' abroad .	32.935337
what does he think a remark like this `` lousy ' ' one does to our prestige and morale ? ?	86.953
if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a `` lousy job ' ' , then heaven help us all .	96.55268
-- defense secretary robert s . mcnamara has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars .	62.022026

top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time .	93.63676
the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground , sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter .	92.74535
this sum spent for foreign economic aid , the peace corps , food for peace , or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace , increased world trade , and prosperity for every country on the globe .	105.536026
let us prepare for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization .	136.24113
-- it seems college isn ' t what it should be .	25.747694
i refer to the attire worn by the students .	192.56894
upon a visit to a local junior college last week , i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing bermuda shorts .	35.89847
is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years ? ?	91.55676
education should be uppermost in their minds , but with this attire how can anyone think it is so ? ?	87.75763
it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves .	97.5856
high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students .	610.368

-- in today ' s `` voice ' ' , the cta is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens .	57.004944
rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly , and i would be the last to say they should not receive consideration .	73.37556
but why is it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people ? ?	85.62893
why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should ? ?	144.09465
the welfare of citizens , old and young , is the responsibility of the community , not only of that part of it that rides the aj .	100.10821

-- in reply to a letter in today ' s `` voice ' ' urging the sale of meat after 6 p . m . , i wish to state the other side of the story .	68.349724
i am the wife of the owner of a small , independent meat market .	100.68628
my husband ' s hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a . m . to 7 p . m . the early part of the week , and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends .	66.66184
now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings -- and sundays , too , for this is coming .	73.15971
there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source , freezing it , and shipping it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required .	71.530876
if a customer wishes a special cut , it will not be available .	20.137625
we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged , whether we want it or not .	119.54556
most women , in this age of freezers , shop for the entire week on week-ends , when prices are lower .	82.50029
also , many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them .	72.1761
and my husband hasn ' t had a vacation in 14 years .	143.64407
but if we closed the store for a vacation , we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block .	60.472694
the meat cutters ' union , which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area , represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets .	157.06044
what it is trying to do is to protect the little man , too , as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores , with choice of cut being made by the consumer , not the store .	176.99884
-- i , too , congratulate the american legion , of which i am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years , on the recent state convention .	65.60106
i regret that bertha madeira ( today ' s `` voice ' ' ) obtained incorrect information .	37.135796
had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege , the matter she raised would have been clarified .	121.60219
the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag .	84.42491
judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this .	53.67216
the resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag .	60.97949
it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and , without an amendment to the law , we could not enforce this .	78.7575
my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises , and not by innuendo criticize them .	146.92084
at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties .	60.565586
-- the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children .	40.413357
in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children , the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field .	55.49514
the illinois commission for handicapped children , which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children , of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois , and of promoting more adequate services for them , indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children .	87.68823

( editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page ) .	51.139454
-- your july 26 editorial regarding the position of attorney general robert f . kennedy on prospective tax relief for dupont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact .	55.205555
as a result , your criticism of attorney general robert f . kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair .	20.25854
the editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on dupont stockholders , in connection with the united states supreme court ruling that dupont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings .	57.34363
these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that dupont stockholders might have to pay -- from an estimated 1 . 1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars .	81.6992
congressman wilbur d . mills , chairman of the house ways and means committee , asked the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law enforcement .	179.05807
the attorney general responded by letter dated july 19 .	32.268585
copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public .	121.84655
in this letter , mr . kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments .	157.41747
there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress , not the department of justice , to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation .	91.719185
yet your editorial said `` now the attorney general writes that no considerations ' justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' ' .	71.44422
what mr . kennedy , in fact , wrote was `` it is the department ' s view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' .	54.14229
the editorial , by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement , totally distorted mr . kennedy ' s views .	43.587856
the headline is offensive , particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial .	26.521614
-- i concur most heartily with today ' s letter on the futility of writing to sen . dirksen and sen . douglas .	88.849525

-- overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation ' s main industries .	46.83163
in covert socialism -- toward which america is moving -- private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them .	285.60156
in order to attract new industries , 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise .	400.6479

sir -- we are writing in reference to a recent `` suggestion ' ' made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ) .	93.56427
the day before election day , to which we are entitled as a legal holiday , we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party ' ' .	79.59507
being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we felt this wasn ' t a function of our position .	112.39523
as we understand , this directive was given to all city and county employes .	142.86536
to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation .	142.78056
we , therefore , considered the `` suggestion ' ' an insult to our intelligence , ethics , bill of rights , etc . .	39.346992
our only obligation for this day is to vote , free of persuasion , for the person we feel is capable in directing the public .	115.613495
this is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the united states .	55.773315
sir -- i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters .	103.199
does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready to demand that `` the community ' ' help and protect them ? ?	73.39498
community shelters are , of course , necessary for those having no space for shelter .	111.563385
if in a town of 2 , 000 private homes , half of them have shelters , the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent .	88.44437
in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home ' s occupants , `` plus-one ' ' -- so he will be able to take in a stranger .	66.694046
i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart , will get busy and be the first member of our `` plus-one ' ' shelter club .	112.40478

sir -- when the colonies decided upon freedom from england , we insisted , through the declaration of independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity .	57.108387
it is high time the united states began to realize that the god-given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga .	157.81541
in the united nations charter , the right of self-determination is also an essential principle .	70.674835
the people of katanga had fought for , and obtained , their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga , and his cohorts .	97.88288
by political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they were justified in doing so .	57.527344
the united states and the u . n . denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the katangans .	61.34527
sir -- permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to .	119.37068
the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny .	79.34418
the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers .	244.43106
under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed	30.228354
the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate .	86.01052
this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college , and the director and two members of the board of freeholders .	37.72059
it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders , which `` shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed , levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes ' ' .	81.01932
the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college .	38.718018
since two of these could be trustees of the college , actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue .	44.57327
sir -- your editorial , `` housing speedup ' ' , is certainly not the answer to our slum problems .	41.567883
the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions .	113.10868
change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties .	74.71089
then see what a boom in all trades , as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers , will happen .	102.292336
our entire economy will have a terrific uplift .	9.614261
sir -- an old man is kicked to death by muggers .	232.13574
the medical examiner states that death was due to `` natural causes ' ' .	17.593355
i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york , it is listed as `` death due to natural causes ' ' .	78.386894
sir -- every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit `` our changing skyline in newark ' ' .	83.0865
it will be at the museum until march 30 .	17.863066
it is a revelation of what has been done , what is being done and what will be done in newark as shown by architects ' plans , models and pictures .	110.65081
it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud of this city .	479.27594
it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic , school and religious life of the community so that that phase of newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit .	132.42088
sir -- i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway .	64.463585
recently i traveled the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere .	188.67294
one even gave my little dog a biscuit .	20.817371
the viewers of the `` deep peep show ' ' at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp .	97.49286
twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encountered .	111.50797
this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing .	241.12024
the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay .	67.58919
some of the stumps are as much as three feet long , but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments .	51.18463
although the wood has been changed to coal , much of it still retains its original cell structure .	391.75287
in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time .	45.776802
these microfossils indicate the swamp was `` formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing .	120.34009
the 15th street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street reported in the washington post , august 2 , 1955 , which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger .	83.0882
recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air .	77.96547
while i respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that i would like to question .	121.890594
he said , `` let ' s work for peace instead of protection from aggression ' ' .	116.160126
i would ask , `` why not do both ' ' ? ?	17.135681
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people .	23.235191
are we not late , especially those of us who call ourselves friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding ? ?	145.52948
as to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone .	125.38989
is this a reason for saving no one ? ?	11.014224
would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone ? ?	184.37265
the speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face .	112.83552
if the world comes to this , wouldn ' t it be the very time when courage and american know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild ? ?	84.015686
many of our young people think it would .	456.6066
lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it `` civilian defense ' ' .	101.5897
in 1950 , public law 920 created civil defense ( different from civilian-groups of world war 2 ) , a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade .	101.90452
far from creating fear , as the speaker suggests , preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence .	281.37048
civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm , flood , accident or even war ? ?	111.25734
it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs .	91.33029
i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone ' s apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide .	145.78534
in addition , would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash ? ?	104.41846
i grant that the dog may not be really protective , based on his training , but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog ? ?	195.22119
i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments .	140.07584
use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe ? ?	201.86613
could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal ? ?	14.050109
is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists ' comfort ? ?	41.628757
perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended .	36.655273
the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak .	7.1817822
why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat ? ?	53.072414
unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season .	363.38437
as an added suggestion to balance the budget , the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument .	172.60211
it is visible throughout the city , and men from madison ave . would jump at the chance .	122.8254
sen . hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart .	53.02763
he , like most of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors .	80.233955
let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens .	68.66221
let us , like the french , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd .	210.67024
two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee ( may 2 ) by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work .	109.31539
for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity .	89.46737
the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations .	90.40587
recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations .	73.094444
president kennedy was right when he said , `` we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate ' ' .	54.799347
i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and the far east .	51.913086
it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war .	40.482597
the fact is that the italians , french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs .	99.01724
we have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war .	83.16324
we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin .	49.198025
it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us .	35.636555
but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany .	81.32541
soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation .	66.55138
in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated .	104.19563
the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism .	20.670727
berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse .	144.89107
actually , the communists , out of fear of a united and armed germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the u . n . .	85.23801
if the communists are sincere in wanting a united , neutral and disarmed germany , it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age .	168.63104
it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation .	225.49646
france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany .	63.00465
if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria .	275.23538
president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` operation survival ' ' which has many facets .	96.951706
why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states ? ?	112.762314
a united germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world .	70.13029
in your editorial of sept . 30 `` the smoldering congo ' ' you make the following comment `` far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments .	187.44737
it is up to the assembly to take action against them .	67.42563
they are violating their charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion ' ' .	65.010956
i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations	8.750123
the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization .	11.573062
the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly .	41.186935
a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years ' ' .	81.1718
the u . s . s . r . and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget .	75.35202
but they refuse , as do the arab states , to support the united nations ' expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel , and the u . n . troops in the congo , which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations , but by a special budget .	48.584316
according to the official interpretation of the charter , a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the `` special ' ' united nations ' budgets , and of course cannot be expelled from the organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ) , due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion .	81.75419
connally amendment ' s repeal held step toward world order	10496.856
in your sept . 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress you referred to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril ' ' .	89.28054
yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country ' s domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international court of justice .	36.511234
the connally amendment says that the united states , rather than the court , shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party .	41.16864
if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic , the court has no jurisdiction .	99.78456
since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states , it also prevents us from using the court effectively .	91.05369
yet although the kennedy administration , and the eisenhower administration before it , have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been taken .	124.308014
our `` destiny ' ' in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law .	131.56918
to achieve this destiny , acts as well as words are needed -- not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect .	305.20377
what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment -- an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court , enable us to utilize it , and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order ? ?	126.45049
we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment .	35.552616
many home-bound subway riders utilizing the flushing-main street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their express comes to a stop , leaving them stranded and strained .	150.59335
to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy-fourth street and change for the ind , this takes a daily toll of time and temper .	129.14511
the transit authority has recently placed in operation `` hold ' ' lights at bmt thirty-ninth and fifty-ninth street stations in brooklyn .	114.11802
this `` holds ' ' the local until the express passengers change trains .	238.52643
without question , this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the woodside station .	70.13243
as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day .	125.59741
in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service .	63.305252
it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing .	132.69635
however , there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators .	150.61374
i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls , special long-distance calls , etc . .	47.360523
either it is lack of training , lack of proper screening when hiring , lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company , which does have a government-blessed monopoly .	107.50024
i disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled .	65.30883
the funeral for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price , far less than i had expected to pay .	120.39806
recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children .	31.719498
hazel park donates its recreation center , five days a week , to the school .	47.111813
there is no charge and no state aid .	14.907113
kiwanis , american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support .	95.086235
there are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school .	56.17048
reading , writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass .	86.91292
enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon .	147.70912
southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus ( the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ) .	216.10396
the school is located at 9-1/2 mile road , woodward heights .	22.142565
visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do .	117.45548
i was surprised at mayor miriani ' s defeat , but perhaps mayor-elect cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago .	179.89378
maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare , dpw and sanitation .	112.465256
negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great .	149.39926
he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night .	80.652054
there should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling .	187.16574
our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case .	120.623726
drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out .	68.3581
educate the city employes to give real service to the public .	21.950417
after all , they are paid by the public , they should be examples .	54.880596
at a recent meeting of the women ' s association of the trumbull ave . united presbyterian church , considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible .	71.01003
some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the daily prayer and three minutes a day , as being very helpful .	95.08887
we feel that the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines .	102.12595
thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence .	249.89203
how old do you have to be to remember when americans , especially children , were encouraged to be polite ? ?	133.6604
why has this form of gentility gone out of american life ? ?	34.58224
how can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults are due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely ? ?	237.89488
writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern ' ' parents they have observed .	82.388084
from necessity , they are also inspired by the `` hard-sell ' ' attitude of the sponsor , so , finally , it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising .	75.17738
i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area .	42.70092
i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles .	332.1005
we have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city .	133.40477
maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost ' ' town .	133.25536
i worked on the schuylkill expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn ' t be an expressway .	73.07649
without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future .	68.29284
mr . george hough ( oct . 30 ) sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop .	67.23044
the trucks today help pay for this highway .	15.057919
they try to keep within the speed limits .	6.3240476
although today ' s trucks are as fast as passenger cars , a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road .	66.069565
the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter `` simpleton ' ' instead of `` simplicitude ' ' .	82.729164
such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden .	243.25761
there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates , but not for the dropouts .	55.583485
what we need is more vocational training in high schools , not more dropouts .	58.552643
i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! !	171.52461
i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is .	144.77808
will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? ?	135.86797
if an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it .	229.22537
as i see it , if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back , the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary .	92.28031
why do we need bigger and better bombs ? ?	5.8712354
i repeat , two wrongs do not make a right .	61.020966
everyone should take time to read martin luther ' s hymn `` a mighty fortress is our god ' ' .	26.738276
to our everlasting shame , we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki .	67.44544
having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race .	57.664387
are we to be the master of the atom , or will the atom be our master -- and destroy us ! !	115.91987
just because cheddi jagan , new boss of british guiana , was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isn ' t a red .	52.088207
we have quite a few home-grown specimens of our own .	105.13927
if we go all gooey over this newest castro ( until he proves he isn ' t ) we ' ve got rocks in our heads .	90.50554
how many times must we get burned before we learn ? ?	71.723816
just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one .	461.59058
the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides .	115.22016
intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan , london or pearl harbor .	80.26821
that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war .	214.42038
russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world .	141.54703
why aren ' t the soviets expelled from the u . n . ? ?	10.695067
while `` better late than never ' ' may have certain merits , the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation .	46.988968
had it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations was living , unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and , in many ways , thankless task .	103.12256
according to one report , however , mr . hammarskjold was considered `` too controversial ' ' a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring .	39.238476
actually , of course , that label `` controversial ' ' applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union .	98.86631
at khrushchev ' s door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated .	195.28291
it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed .	365.60156
as has happened so often in the past , the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy .	63.90586
just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a first-class example of `` people to people ' ' good will .	108.52641
if only this could be done more often -- with such heartening results -- many of the earth ' s `` big problems ' ' would shrink to the insignificances they really are .	132.86192
thanks for your good coverage of ahmad ' s visit , too ! !	45.18004
your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable	472.19745
one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea .	104.03647
we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice .	61.149418
they start on the east side of the schuylkill , have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination .	158.11778
bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings .	180.04893
each one of these is , by its nature , a focal point or a point of natural congestion .	41.79563
we should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep cars starting and ending on the east side of the river -- on the east side .	92.20335
this can be accomplished by several logical steps ( 1 )	25.27565
widen the east river drive at least one lane .	244.51021
so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems .	225.0543
paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges .	206.15042
one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent .	204.43538
this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive .	35.24449
i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square 1 .	125.47865
replace it with the statue of one or another of the world ' s famous dictators .	48.268814
there ' s no sense in being reminded of times that were .	515.169
washington square seems not part of a free land .	512.4074
it may remind one of russia , china or east berlin	137.80846
but it can ' t remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for .	119.598076
the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals , because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square .	124.16827
the matter may seem a small thing to some people , i know , but it ' s a very good start on the road to totalitarianism the commission has posted signs in washington square saying	75.661224
the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square .	42.222343
does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance ? ?	452.10522
if birds don ' t belong in a square or park , what does ? ?	117.504616
they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature .	245.76163
but the commission does not share such sentiments .	4.4036565
the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds .	107.19031
starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon , from city hall .	32.46136
if any are left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too .	87.189285
the city government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives .	108.01087
let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe , lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive .	217.68488
of course , in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we ' re afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say , `` how come ? ?	133.12871
who wants this deed done ' ' ? ?	1.0810986
-- in this small way do the leaders of a city , or of a nation , inure the masses to watching , or even inflicting , torture and death , upon even their fellow men .	127.09313
one means to help the birds occurs to me let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily , discontinue any piece of music but one .	170.05383
let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began , the hymn `` abide with me ' ' .	79.93419
we will know , and he will know , to whom it is rendered , what the birds would ask	155.66394
there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too `` soft ' ' .	48.532486
unfortunately , those who would remedy our `` softness ' ' seek to do so with calisthenics .	84.42258
they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy .	32.02799
it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft .	120.95231
ashamed of our wealth and power , afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace , we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies .	167.25487
when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation , when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no longer be `` soft ' ' .	113.32025
america doesn ' t need to `` push-up ' ' , she needs to stand up ! !	24.5578
the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals , is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit .	95.22091
however , he states unequivocally `` the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor ' ' .	110.94022
i must , in fairness , take issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals .	113.56188
the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with `` sweetheart contracts ' ' .	49.330082
these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes .	99.55706
a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute .	287.2402
anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders .	181.66878
further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrum-griffin act .	64.02183
the nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet .	95.07831
it is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories .	283.3475
they predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting .	48.752705
the biggest nuclear device the united states has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our b-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece .	261.859
some time ago , however , mr . khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the soviet union would make them .	115.64923
he seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock .	127.89811
and now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side .	109.82172
khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ? ?	1.0489212
so be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing .	158.0271
so escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds .	112.078255
what is needed , philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun ( october 26 ) is a discontinuity .	70.388756
the escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon .	337.6467
`` only a discontinuity can end it ' ' , professor morrison writes .	52.582344
`` the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy ' ' .	105.942116
morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- europe of course must be written off out of hand .	65.87434
he feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take .	78.570366
his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon , governor rockefeller , past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission , dr . edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war .	47.31761
these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security .	85.8777
capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation ' s security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .	70.423035
if this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation .	116.06345
he has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges .	141.60379
but if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously .	228.75444
not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere .	119.090965
khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps .	238.14139
when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural .	62.862705
thus , when the russians sent up their first sputnik , american chagrin was human enough , and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable .	217.18102
but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly .	71.115074
when east germans fled to the west by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of western publicists .	89.357376
they are less vocal now , when it is the west berliners who are migrating .	155.56644
the flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic .	380.03754
west berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable .	442.29752
nearly 18 per cent of west berlin ' s 2 , 200 , 000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12 . 8 per cent are under fifteen .	81.42315
r . h . s . crossman , m . p . , writing in the manchester guardian , states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1 , 700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1 , 900 a week .	127.56562
the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people .	108.803055
whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead .	80.17399
the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany , but the hard truth , says crossman , is that `` the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german , as distinct from russian , troops was a major communist victory , which dealt west berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow .	126.335205
the gallant half-city is dying on its feet ' ' .	7.16395
another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer ( london ) .	98.52568
mark arnold-foster writes `` people are leaving ( west berlin ) because they think it is dying .	84.511505
they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers ' federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months ' front-line work in factories in west berlin .	62.09825
berlin ' s resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed ' ' .	116.198074
the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city .	129.05542
state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort , will not avail .	93.499115
tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful .	142.8967
the materials for compromise are at hand the nation , walter lippmann and other sober commentators ( see alan clark on p . 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .	125.61634
a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save berlin .	91.06894
or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence , if that is what the west wants .	154.37611
the removal of stalin ' s body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history .	133.30212
it is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead .	36.79729
a british writer , richard haestier , in a book , dead men tell tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry 4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob .	105.14964
and in england , after the restoration , the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn .	139.3057
the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows .	25.631361
contemplating these posthumous punishments , stalin should not lose all hope .	76.46189
in 1899 , parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster , facing whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands .	152.7459
nikita khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself .	90.03224
the lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste .	147.53294
who will take stalin ' s place beside lenin ? ?	5.647912
there is karl marx , of course , buried in london .	267.3031
the macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable .	103.41841
who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin ? ?	22.668615
since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people .	50.567066
besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life .	70.995445
suppose he did lie beside lenin , would it be permanent ? ?	175.2408
if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? ?	115.2849
when a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put .	43.480305
if nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand .	141.48857
the appointment of u thant of burma as the u . n . ' s acting secretary general -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .	109.81857
mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland were early favorites in the running , but france didn ' t like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter .	104.99323
with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr . hammarskjold , u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .	56.07585
what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy .	170.72104
in all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .	231.76689
he has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .	40.269054
he is a buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung .	97.7479
u thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when mr . hammarskjold ' s term would have come to an end .	47.18982
whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen .	145.61491
mr . khrushchev ' s demand for a troika is dormant , not dead	520.4742
the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents .	117.10535
in a sense , the showdown promised by mr . hammarskjold ' s sudden and tragic death has been avoided	50.577545
structurally , the u . n . is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it .	103.90177
but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong .	130.9184
no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .	350.01917
these are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it , as messrs . salsich and engh report on page 372 .	164.52243
even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ?	374.67938
) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading .	134.86542
friends , a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley , alabama .	119.27016
`` if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast ' ' , the account reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls .	92.190636
heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving civil defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute ' s notice ' ' .	96.77236
according to friends , the unit was organized by john snook , a former world war 2 , commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company .	46.558083
the girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck	135.53362
they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories .	146.20372
this may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy .	88.26413
the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .	85.43027
the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms	149.21307
a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined .	20.313875
as the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real .	145.29968
soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .	295.45276
all false gods resemble moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice .	92.07206
but there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands .	144.4628
the annual butchery of 40 , 000 american men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive	134.7102
a quota of 25 , 000 a year would be more than sufficient .	70.656906
no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace .	140.08258
if the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25 , 000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states .	96.662094
but by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily .	83.92588
yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical .	161.3319
here , then , is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning .	62.73547
from next new year ' s day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication .	123.00334
to avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse	281.18286
but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners .	100.66789
then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july 4 , 1963 .	91.67
the scene , of course , should be nine miles northwest of centralia , illinois , the geographical center of population according to the census .	147.58107
a special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized .	82.94934
the band should play the rogues ' march as a processional , switching to `` hail columbia , happy land ' ' ! !	86.324684
independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it .	98.20551
the highway system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40 , 000 americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do .	73.82541
hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better .	79.733986
moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social .	281.8965
it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as it is generally termed , staying put .	133.79463
true , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , `` home-keeping hearts are happiest ' ' , is as disreputable as socinianism .	141.84438
nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists , which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith .	116.66437
perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia , robert ruark ' s grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is `` all this gallivantin ' ' ' .	68.966324
in any event , the yearly sacrifice of 40 , 000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith .	185.93384
somehow our contemporary moloch must be induced to see reason .	311.0621
since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example .	191.85632
if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25 , 000 per annum , then somebody is going to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson .	193.76672
to hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways	74.160774
so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected .	20.431555
as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race .	36.141098
but the guilt is shared by the united states , britain and france , the other members of the atomic club .	41.45997
until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 , the us and uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down .	100.74511
as it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body	54.503468
for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies .	114.53101
the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations .	105.62317
so , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr . khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat .	121.16999
shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions	790.07715
on october 19 , after the soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country , in `` self protection ' ' , might have to resume above-ground tests .	85.05518
more recently , the chairman of the atomic energy commission , dr . glenn t . seaborg , `` admitted ' ' to a news conference in las vegas , nevada , that the us might fall behind russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain .	104.98071
all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood .	137.17598
but for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science ' s worst-marked channels , full of tricky currents and unknown depths .	90.63312
the scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the most vital points , at least publicly .	62.042492
on the one hand , the public health service declared as recently as october 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern ' ' or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the aj .	204.69543
but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states ' ' .	58.3501
then it added `` it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected ' ' .	109.03464
having hedged its bets in this way , phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all `` at present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected ' ' .	117.00465
then , to conclude on an indeterminate note `` nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world ' ' .	87.528366
dr . linus pauling , a nobel prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not .	76.77196
after declaring , in an article last month in frontier magazine , that the russian testing `` carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world ' ' , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled 200 megatons	72.03616
the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160 , 000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects .	81.06635
long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200 , 000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia .	254.83978
most of these would be in the northern hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating .	33.46166
pauling ' s estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility .	59.932575
the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn .	159.5066
but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem .	137.25494
its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .	450.91635
an illustration of this attitude is found in john a . mccone ' s letter to dr . thomas lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic .	116.49221
to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout .	161.35536
a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec ' s division of biology and medicine stated `` the question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered ' ' herein .	128.29001
of course , the aec is in a bind now .	225.60088
if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests .	74.6265
so the commission ' s announcements of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague .	73.33474
now , of course , that the russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid , when the us was testing in the atmosphere .	73.96072
the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold .	107.72829
after a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof .	102.12449
yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout , it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count .	134.51474
as of october 25 , the aec had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of tnt )	72.7545
and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported .	97.41108
assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons .	208.9685
some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated .	113.42091
if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far .	105.26422
to this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in november , 1958 .	60.615597
one of the inescapable realities of the cold war is that it has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas .	114.87198
the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself .	37.7423
that dilemma is as much with us as ever .	116.04524
the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests .	67.47027
when this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late ' 50 ' s -- the united states appeared to have three choices .	121.53223
it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations .	58.09078
it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination .	84.34528
or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security .	229.32674
with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken .	103.89781
once again , the united states must choose .	202.0598
and once again , the choices are much the same .	33.323593
only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .	71.26624
the first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the russians .	79.23378
the second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere .	152.67322
the third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as russian behavior demonstrates , a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable .	59.122482
we take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us .	134.1708
it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable .	186.95009
its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice	864.9469
one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience .	107.28389
leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice .	91.21874
for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now proposing .	128.52647
in particular , governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests .	73.29125
speaking recently in miami , governor rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests ' ' .	47.289955
taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the united states is `` to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right ' ' .	71.65944
what was missing in the governor ' s argument , as in so many similar arguments , was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right .	139.07341
the possibility , as he asserted , that the russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand .	155.19318
besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governor ' s case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary .	99.255775
recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have , to the contrary , assured us that our lead is very great .	152.20103
unless the administration and the defense department have been deceiving us , the facts do not support the assertion that we are `` compelled ' ' to resume atmospheric testing .	61.96852
it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in the future , be necessary and even justifiable .	64.269
but a resumption does not seem justifiable now .	9.083395
what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations .	108.82926
we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake .	147.57367
this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism .	86.3701
too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part .	83.9951
there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does .	111.119225
the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start .	57.001957
when his holiness pope john 23 , first called for an ecumenical council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for christian unity , the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate .	119.09041
with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom .	299.65417
but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides .	80.94993
the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church .	59.909863
as it has turned out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses .	81.20757
two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy .	222.05457
first of all , it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity .	96.14087
far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the pontiff believes that a revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light .	180.05925
equally significant , pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity .	541.7461
a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity .	71.69314
secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church .	113.640755
the establishment , by the holy father , of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern .	113.165924
the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches assembly in new delhi as `` official ' ' observers reverses the church ' s earlier stand .	112.12529
the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state , cardinal cicognani , for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act .	145.6504
nor can one forget pope john ' s unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury .	46.92604
augustin cardinal bea , the director of the secretariate for christian unity , has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the church ' s stance toward the protestant and orthodox churches .	122.15838
noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone .	60.198948
for discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts , `` would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of god , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit ' ' .	79.955956
can any christian fail to respond to these words ? ?	12.985756
the administration ' s official budget review , which estimates a 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year , isn ' t making anyone happy .	50.6202
certainly it isn ' t making the president happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year .	131.97401
we sympathize with mr . kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn ' t please us either , although for very different reasons .	119.44994
furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring .	253.2663
in the first place , a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhower ' s estimate of a 1 . 5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing president ' s farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor .	54.11632
the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received .	169.10855
the rest of the deficit is also easily understood .	14.023603
four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense , an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration , quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere .	122.17434
four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglected by mr . eisenhower .	91.667816
the farm program will cost an additional 1 . 5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the food for peace program and other new measures .	132.26836
anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit .	84.1624
our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures .	200.62009
and yet mr . kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up ' ' and `` economizing ' ' .	55.824352
we wish the president would remember that `` fiscal responsibility ' ' was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election .	130.89287
the party that won used to say something about a new frontier .	39.434513
introduction of the `` dialogue ' ' principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october .	79.29951
two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants , and when the speaker was a catholic , one `` discussant ' ' on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion .	110.08396
sessions devoted to `` ethics and foreign policy trends ' ' , `` moral principle and political judgment ' ' , `` christian ethics in the cold war ' ' and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves .	138.93163
usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker or discussion leader .	82.004814
in the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law , which dr . william v . o ' brien of georgetown university , advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy .	71.99527
that aristotelean-thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants , but in the end the concept came to reassert itself .	67.836
speakers declared that protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name .	113.08641
a lebanese moslem told about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the `` divine law ' ' , while a c . a . i . p . member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new u . n . nations told of its widespread recognition on the african continent .	85.23065
the impression was unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence .	102.3771
another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself .	83.745705
the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable .	68.600815
it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other ' s positions and better comprehension of one ' s own .	95.58735
but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed , and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues .	280.2102
one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical ' ' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend berlin , for example	92.019485
the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account	307.1603
it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative .	183.06831
everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question .	115.072136
i was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy .	107.585625
i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts .	277.80576
but i questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian ' s dreamy irredentism .	39.462776
their answer was it can be done , and we will do it .	34.201847
and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang kai-shek `` in america ' ' , i said , `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland .	40.102577
what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done ' ' ? ?	38.518322
( he always smiles -- at least at visitors , i gather .	176.13686
he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions .	169.3588
i recalled sympathetically the duke ' s complaint in browning ' s `` my last duchess ' ' .	28.324978
) he smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , `` the president wonders where you are going after you leave taipei ' ' ? ?	83.928474
that , i smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one .	107.73973
i answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly .	81.823494
chiang spoke again , this time at greater length .	28.215694
`` the president says ' ' , the translator came in , `` that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question .	137.04274
he says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant .	79.88557
so you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions .	85.28306
any information we have here in taiwan is at your disposal ' ' .	17.385456
for every person on taiwan , there are sixty in mainland china .	169.72128
if the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think of liberation , as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia .	138.89883
less than 60-1 , but at least 6-1 .	6.841947
the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army .	28.255459
the armed forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about 450 , 000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated .	264.24786
it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia , and the army the best trained .	110.75988
even so , it adds up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight ? ?	114.28362
the miserable people of china , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play , cannot themselves resist overtly .	474.43094
they think , perforce , of physical survival everything else is secondary .	137.50894
but the army which mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies ? ?	111.49909
the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in china over thousands of years .	108.90812
it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist depersonalization .	143.45892
every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation .	82.77431
the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? ?	225.87515
the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed a despot does not economize on his generals .	308.11807
but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews .	160.48996
to whom will the generals stay loyal ? ?	1.1928084
there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in place of ideological purity out on the farm .	149.16777
it is another question whether `` they ' ' -- or a single general , off in a corner of china , secure for a few ( galvanizing ? ?	94.59286
) days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the party .	84.29635
but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there .	42.827724
the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .	77.59355
the first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .	225.43636
and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .	139.004
for it is the family that , in china , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .	148.90709
but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .	117.37547
thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .	150.26546
tibet has historically served china as a buffer state .	121.969154
a friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile .	454.1557
china never tried to integrate tibet by extirpating the people ' s religion and institutions .	105.29159
red china is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed .	67.67704
tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult .	169.75706
tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleeding france .	97.37903
these continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension .	191.13841
the imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from the outside , might cause it to snap .	133.55286
the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men .	97.85558
they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control .	186.24832
first and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime .	58.460106
secondly , they depend on america ' s `` moral cooperation ' ' when the crucial moment arrives .	162.88155
they hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly .	130.69566
i remarked jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day .	139.95786
he affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point .	175.68423
but he -- and all of china -- wears the scars of american indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are .	89.17426
we have been grand to formosa itself -- lots of aid , and , most of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands .	87.3812
but our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive .	179.14032
a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr . kennedy ' s views on the world struggle .	28.425835
the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike .	52.066914
there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation .	144.72113
the moment of truth is the moment of crisis .	24.093641
during the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures .	159.3118
there the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look .	57.409344
new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones .	297.1811
a truth-revealing crisis erupted in katanga for a couple of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies .	97.94237
before memory , too , clouds over , let us make a note or two of what could be seen .	98.96673
the measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels .	191.94635
one knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine .	182.74403
but i am here concerned more with policy than with men .	124.821686
public men come and go but great issues of policy remain .	118.55135
now , everyone knows -- or knew in the week of december 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy .	163.37894
the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved .	100.69035
of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations .	15.451236
but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the u . s . was in reality the principal .	47.090748
the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies , to the entire western community .	92.9343
by our policy the west was -- is -- split .	80.26771
the controlling pattern was first displayed in the hungary-suez crisis of november 1956 .	568.04126
it reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality in cuba last spring ( with which the dominican events of last month should be paired )	190.9615
at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles	174.21494
in relation to laos , algeria , south africa	3.7496824
right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana .	188.97212
this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows under prevailing policy , the u . s . can take the initiative against the right , but cannot take the initiative against the left .	45.165897
it makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue .	274.38782
the u . s . cannot take the initiative against the left .	81.89832
there is even some question whether the u . s . can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left .	112.34857
we can attack tshombe , but not gigenza .	18.309143
no matter that gizenga is moscow ' s man in the congo .	104.66726
no matter that it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men .	311.20886
no matter that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western interests in africa .	65.25635
( even granted that the congo should be unified , you don ' t protect western security by first removing the pro-western weight from the power equilibrium .	162.45648
we can force britain and france out of the suez , but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest .	109.20822
we can mass our fleet against the trujillos , but not against the castros .	62.998127
we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall -- much less , give the simple order to push the wall down .	123.83123
we officially receive the anti-french , moscow-allied algerian fln , but we denounce the pro-europe , anti-communist oas as criminal .	82.696465
in the very week of our war against katanga , we make a $133 million grant to kwame nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship .	81.74343
as our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-western katangans , we stand supinely bleating while nehru ' s troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato ally , portugal .	160.39609
it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy .	208.8933
the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration , but only made more consistent and more active .	124.435104
most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa , katanga and ghana , as to the suez-hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of asia , africa and latin america .	68.23861
from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted ' ' ( `` neutralist ' ' , `` contested ' ' ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- nehru , tito , nkrumah , sukarno , betancourt , etc . .	45.890118
our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes .	142.46548
if we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible .	110.3025
and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left .	70.647
to write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it .	93.56449
nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else ' s book .	79.2408
to get started , he does not scan the world about him	399.04785
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists .	133.3357
so far this season , broadway ' s premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original american stage plays .	444.48517
of straight dramas , there are all the way home , which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel , a death in the family	106.96009
the wall , awkwardly based on the john hersey novel	40.240936
advise and consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller	197.72781
face of a hero ( closed ) , based on a pierre boulle novel .	96.4607
the only original works attempting to reach any stature tennessee williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , period of adjustment , and arthur laurents ' clever but empty invitation to a march .	206.07504
clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- a taste of honey , by britain ' s young ( 19 when she wrote it ) shelagh delaney	218.89397
the hostage ( closed ) , by ireland ' s brendan behan .	127.798256
among the musicals , camelot came from t . h . white ' s the once and future king , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do re mi .	98.13132
wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce .	252.38501
the only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- send me no flowers ( closed ) , under the yum-yum tree , critic ' s choice .	125.289604
in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival , broadway is not even adapting books , but reconverting old movies ( hail the conquering hero and lili ) .	241.07323
originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad .	26.63054
some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably life with father and diary of anne frank .	136.38438
and particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from die fledermaus and the merry widow to oklahoma ! and my fair lady .	209.06996
as critic walter kerr points out `` adaptations , so long as they are good , still qualify as creative ' ' .	94.335754
and other defenders invariably argue that , after all , shakespeare and moliere were adapters too .	126.70127
the difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world	142.62073
most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own stage technique .	127.71571
the most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers cannot afford to take chances .	290.6146
off-broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original .	239.19821
laudably enough , it is offering classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one u . s . original was on the boards , robert d . hock ' s stunning civil war work , borak .	112.23751
the real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of u . s . playwrights .	44.67871
he `` come with me to the casbah ' ' .	2.604811
she `` by subway or cab ' ' ? ?	8.564167
that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan , as more and more new yorkers were discovering 29th street and eighth avenue , where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like arabian nights , grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american inpost of belly dancing .	81.0262
their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis .	130.22139
the belly boites , with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek and turkish families .	57.491833
between performances , enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces .	80.39392
except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption .	78.772224
small , shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time , using guitars , violins , and more alien instruments with names that would open sesame the oud , grandfather of the lute	138.10454
the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass	321.44278
the girls sit quietly with the musicians , wearing prim dresses or plain , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem .	108.87722
if a dancer is good , she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny -- the continuum of mankind .	90.21863
but a great many of what variety calls the `` cooch terpers ' ' are considerably less cosmic than that .	87.70065
each dancer follows the ancient oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room .	133.83197
this is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) .	205.6554
the new york dancers are highly eclectic , varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls .	100.079285
the belly dance leaves more to the imagination .	18.294212
when a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers ' costumes .	166.24965
with tips , the girls average between $150 and $200 a week , depending on basic salary .	112.86683
although they are forbidden to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks , and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy .	99.747505
all over the country , belly clubs have never been bigger , especially in detroit , boston and chicago , and even in small towns	68.32219
one of the best dancers , a turkish girl named semra , works at a roadhouse outside bristol , conn . .	116.22367
the girls are kept booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded murat somay , a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central abdomen .	120.32064
he can offer nine turkish girls , plans to import at least 15 more .	260.74573
but a great many of the dancers are more or less native .	132.84064
sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conducted by lebanese and syrians in the u . s . , where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs .	68.84803
as the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins , the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly .	99.52806
jemela ( surname gerby ) , 23 , seems hong kong oriental but has a spanish father and an indian mother , was born in america and educated at holy cross academy and textile high school , says she learned belly dancing at family picnics .	153.49844
serene ( mrs . wilson ) , 23 , was born in budapest and raised in manhattan .	83.973076
daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance , she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the new york casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body .	110.896324
many belly dancers are married , but serene is one of the few who will admit it .	58.04706
marlene ( surname adamo ) , 25 , a brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from arabic friends in paris , now lives on manhattan ' s west side , is about the best belly dancer working the casbah , loves it so much that she dances on her day off .	163.10509
she has the small , highly developed body of a prime athlete , and holds in contempt the `` girls who just move sex ' ' .	149.44977
leila ( malia phillips ) , 25 , is a greenwich village painter of persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles .	254.3725
a graduate of hollywood high school , she likes to imagine herself , as she takes the floor , `` a village girl coming in to a festival ' ' .	118.06868
gloria ( surname ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who was born in italy and once did `` chorus work ' ' in toronto , has been around longer than most of the others , wistfully remembers the old days when `` we used to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all .	95.09857
but the ships are very slow now , and we don ' t get so many sailors any more ' ' .	76.15603
the uptown crowd has moved in , and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar ? ?	365.9485
of the handful of painters that austria has produced in the 20th century , only one , oskar kokoschka , is widely known in the u . s . .	34.9951
this state of unawareness may not last much longer .	23.285448
for ten years a small group of european and u . s . critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten austrian expressionist egon schiele , who died 42 years ago at the age of 28 .	60.09575
the critics ' campaign finally inspired the first major u . s . exhibit of schiele ' s works .	22.373207
the show has been to boston and manhattan , will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis .	125.75862
last week it opened at the j . b . speed museum in louisville , at the very moment that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau gallery in los angeles .	92.91551
schiele ' s paintings are anything but pleasant .	19.872887
his people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened .	81.0873
his colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom .	212.9846
but he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination .	148.73274
the son of a railway stationmaster , schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town of tulln , 14 miles northwest of vienna .	176.81908
he was an emotional , lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork .	150.2742
when he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna .	49.342422
even there he did not last for long .	6.766221
cried one professor after a few months of student schiele ' s tantrums and rebellion `` the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ' ' ! !	184.50063
for a while his work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of gustav klimt , then the dean of austrian art .	83.402664
gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter .	131.08586
his pictures were roundly denounced as `` the most disgusting things one has ever seen in vienna ' ' .	63.336563
he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle .	121.951645
for years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in vienna ' s gutters .	166.78322
drafted into the austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a vienna billet , went on painting .	147.90654
it was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show .	75.86125
the unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too much even for morbid-minded vienna .	158.91098
he was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust .	85.97854
the children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness , and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic .	146.71677
the subject he liked most was the female body , which he painted in every state -- naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sitting primly in a chair , lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace .	80.66079
the most surprising thing about the twenty-second congress of the soviet communist party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the twentieth congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous `` secret ' ' report on stalin .	59.348534
the publication last july of the party ' s draft program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism ' ' -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i . e . , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group ' ' ) in all theoretical party journals .	83.337395
these never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of marx and lenin `` full communism ' ' was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a communist society had now , under khrushchev , become an `` immediate and tangible reality ' ' .	126.75469
it seems that khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to marxist doctrine with his draft program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) .	227.87914
he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` all people ' s state ' ' , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization ' ' of the whole hierarchy of soviets , starting with the supreme soviet itself .	105.53759
their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy ' ' and would enable `` the people ' ' to take a more direct and active part in running the country .	63.240654
there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from .	125.41572
no doubt , there was still a lot in the draft program -- and in khrushchev ' s speech -- which left many points obscure .	149.27762
was it the party ' s intention , for example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes , i . e . , state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively `` urbanized ' ' ) ? ?	115.71365
as we know , the soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot	108.73196
and it is still very far from certain how valid the party ' s claim is that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes ' ' the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm .	173.25322
if one follows the reports of the congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter .	101.262665
the draft program was interesting in other respects , too .	59.10974
it contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays	182.72916
they still benefit far less than the `` other ' ' 50 per cent of the nation from that `` welfare state ' ' which the soviet union so greatly prides itself on being .	116.735374
over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly	601.1295
and , though he repeated , over and over again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the `` ordinary ' ' people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how `` communism ' ' is really going to work in practice , especially in respect of food .	80.29156
would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry ? ?	1.1117502
this was something on which k . himself seemed to have some doubts	53.038486
for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears ' ' of those responsible for agricultural production .	73.08402
and , as we know , the virgin lands are not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped .	160.14595
one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev ' s agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group ' ' -- molotov , malenkov , kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old marshal voroshilov .	86.55654
molotov , in particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services , to increase rents and fares	199.65155
in fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the khrushchev `` welfare state ' ' .	92.474525
the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story what , in the secret councils of the kremlin , molotov had really proposed , we just don ' t know , and he has had no chance to reply .	77.27682
but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party ' ' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism ' ' and , last but not least , on foreign policy .	95.99012
the whole problem of `` peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition ' ' with the capitalist world is in the very center of this congress .	101.83078
`` molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence , reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war .	65.592674
his views , in fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look upon it merely as a variant of the `` cold war ' ' or of an `` armed peace ' ' .	61.96163
one cannot help wondering whether molotov and the rest of the `` anti-party group ' ' are not being used as china ' s whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers .	74.808205
for something , clearly , has gone very , very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese relations , which were never easy , and have now deteriorated .	179.29758
the effect of chou en-lai ' s clash with khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on molotov & co . , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the soviet people , from the `` epoch-making ' ' twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese conflict .	101.03342
not only , as we know , did chou en-lai publicly treat khrushchev ' s attack on albania as `` something that we cannot consider as a serious marxist-leninist approach ' ' to the problem ( i . e . , as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic ' ' ) , but the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and so on .	101.41284
it is extremely doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends .	236.9298
the big question is whether , in the name of a restored chinese-soviet solidarity , the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians to present their humble apologies to khrushchev -- or get rid of enver hoxa .	135.88824
these seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident ' ' can now be closed .	92.94374
but albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between china and russia .	75.16971
khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence ' ' and would like , above all , the berlin and german problems to be settled peacefully	89.99361
he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the russo-american `` honeymoon ' ' of 1959 .	56.03055
but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from china , but perhaps also from that `` china lobby ' ' which , i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago , exists on the quiet inside the party .	128.57072
to these people , solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russia ' s future policy .	159.93213
and the chinese , as the albanian incident shows , have strong suspicions that khrushchev is anxious to secure a `` shameful ' ' peace with the west .	89.07898
the fact that china ( which is obsessed by formosa -- to khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by north korea and north vietnam is highly indicative .	148.68062
and one cannot but wonder whether marshal malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the west , wasn ' t trying to keep the chinese quiet .	125.77518
and this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb .	300.9966
was not this dropped primarily in order to `` appease ' ' the chinese -- especially after `` khrushchev ' s `` humiliating ' ' surrender to the west in canceling the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31 ? ?	84.68336
what does it all add up to ? ?	1.0407935
indications are that khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of berlin ) the maintenance of the status quo in the world .	64.06568
the chinese , north vietnamese and north koreans , on the other hand , feel that , militarily , russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation ' ' they would like to embark on before long with china attacking formosa and the north koreans and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries .	78.748146
perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the `` anti-party group ' ' nearly liquidated him .	70.31388
he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition	243.34534
but if he is up against china ' s crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life .	77.00062
he may support china ( but he won ' t )	24.866777
he may break with china ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuading china to be patient .	181.08482
the next days may show where things stand .	13.213143
on a misty sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-communists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here .	116.442505
eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare .	111.771904
to the average american , this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie .	126.43989
but to the minutemen , this is a serious business .	162.63391
they feel that the united states is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy .	116.78041
they feel that world war 3 , has already begun , and they are setting themselves up as a `` last line of defense ' ' against the communist advance .	140.65633
their national leader , robert bolivar depugh of norborne , mo . , says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the red onslaught .	103.42516
in their maneuvers last month , they wore world war 2 , camouflage garb and helmets , and carried unloaded m-1 rifles .	52.891098
the maneuvers were held `` in secret ' ' after a regional seminar for the minutemen , held in nearby shiloh , ill . , had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs , who had arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville , ill . , and seized four operative weapons , including a browning machine gun , two browning automatic rifles and an m-4 rifle .	79.761215
undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli ' s home at 6 30 a . m . the next day , put on their uniforms , and headed for a farm several miles away .	66.86718
a 60 mm . mortar and a 57 mm . recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along .	111.25447
the mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated .	53.064938
after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war 2 , army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully .	108.89721
here the two leaders , depugh and lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces .	275.77704
the minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment .	123.52063
they were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge .	19.178766
they practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades	108.83647
and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment .	24.83251
eleven dummy rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting .	165.73508
mrs . depugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband ' s organization , participated in all the exercises .	62.313778
there were no `` casualties ' ' , but the `` guerrillas ' ' admitted to being `` a little tired ' ' when the leaders called a halt at 9 a . m . to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane .	99.19588
i would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by russell kirk ( dec . 16 ) .	87.81264
it has to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure .	16.47015
next september , after receiving a degree from yale ' s master of arts in teaching program , i will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers .	99.48293
the amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers .	130.51189
as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers .	62.12894
the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality .	136.02129
hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary .	66.2647
i am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country , the profession is grossly overpaid .	41.39336
it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases	831.2325
there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance .	155.44897
the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them .	261.04144
the only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure .	118.85367
here , as in all sectors of the economy , quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses .	127.93014
on the eve of the `` great debate ' ' on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the atlantic community , we should face the alternatives on this proposition .	85.03876
what we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate .	168.44043
without this power we lay open any american industry which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others .	121.55112
it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs .	44.975567
i disagree with mr . burnham ' s position on the common market ( nov . 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join .	58.818348
for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of this kind is difficult to understand .	72.96935
the pressure for our entry to the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare ' ' , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background .	147.15285
the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal , as well as economic , self-rule .	86.006424
in entering this union we will be surrendering most , if not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the atlantic institute ( recently set up ) or the o . e . c . d . , i . m . f . and others .	83.81007
to think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking .	105.84794
if it is not enough that all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join this market , i refer you to an article in the new york times ' magazine section ( nov . 12 , 1961 ) , by mr . eric johnston , entitled `` we must join the common market ' ' .	121.779236
he says `` it has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs ' ' .	85.567986
referring to britain , he says , `` we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy , placing this authority in continental hands ' ' .	351.72787
since the goal of our international planners is a world government , this atlantic community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once american economic autonomy is absorbed , a larger grouping is a question of time .	201.13245
frankly , it is being very cleverly done for , in a sense , they have us over a barrel .	126.06188
listen to what mr . johnston has to say `` consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict .	106.72141
we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need .	103.15363
we would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment ' ' .	66.87515
but the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community or `` economic empire ' ' , but merely what libertarians like henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry .	72.12429
create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we ' ll compete with anyone , europe and asia combined .	185.83694
in short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won ' t have to worry about european competition or communism either .	112.02482
if we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it	26.221943
if we go into this common market , we might just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees , connally amendments or , for that matter , conservatism in general .	152.37125
we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the atlantic common market which jnr will be continuing in our pages .	68.47025
the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning , november 27 , anticipating by two days the announcement of the u . s . treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed .	83.66704
in 1954 i was drafted and after serving two years honorably on active duty i was not required to participate in any further army reserve activities .	136.33276
now , more than five years later , i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier .	316.1092
but , in spite of this , i , at present a man 31 years of age and a college professor , have been recalled `` by direction of the president ' ' to report on november 25th to fort devens , massachusetts , for another twelve months of active duty as an sp 4 ( the equivalent of a pfc ) .	104.95393
today , seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee , i am assistant professor of philosophy and science at st . michael ' s college .	85.635544
for , after leaving the army in 1956 , i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college and then at the university of toronto .	74.48391
this time , added to that which i had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 , makes a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education .	160.07419
the possibility of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys .	95.087555
however , it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably , equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes ' ' .	211.35878
in my own case , i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking .	220.1634
taken back into the army now as an sp 4 , i am leaving 110 college students whose teacher i am .	238.59708
( a wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes .	139.6114
) at this late date , it is impossible for st . michael ' s college to find a suitable replacement for me .	42.620213
even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- i cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone mad .	136.46336
in news broadcasts i consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army referred to as mercenaries .	44.493435
if the hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for england in the 1770 ' s were mercenaries , what shall we call the un troops sent to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the united nations ? ?	76.71468
if the un troops are not mercenaries then the hessians were not mercenaries either .	115.05342
and if the foreigners fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette and von steuben were mercenaries too , as were also the members of the lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 , and of chennault ' s flying tigers in the early days of world war 2 .	55.03314
it doesn ' t take a gore vidal to tell you what ' s wrong with cherokee textile ' s slogan ( pitney-bowes objects ' ' , july 1 ) .	103.33491
it ' s an eighteenth-century negative , man ! !	58.10776
suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment by moving the term `` republic ' ' to lower case , substituting the modern phrase , `` move ahead ' ' for the stodgy `` keep ' ' , and by using the postmaster ' s name on every envelope ( in caps , of course , with the `` in spite ' ' as faded as possible ) , the slogan cannot fail .	80.396645
in the issue of march 5 , 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said	352.7395
`` on trial in jakarta for having flown for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents , u . s . pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters , he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of indonesia .	67.452515
facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty , he said ' i have participated in the war against communism in korea and at dienbienphu , and i have helped in the evacuation of north vietnamese to the free world .	53.661076
i have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by communist domination .	143.58478
at least in indonesia , khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with communism ' ' ! !	177.60196
since then nothing has happened to save the life of pope .	76.719734
i found recently a very small article in the new york times	9.681478
indonesia court upholds pope ' s death sentence .	10.217252
-- indonesia military supreme court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence pope , an american pilot .	109.19744
pope was convicted last year of having aided north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions .	104.93872
he has been in prison since may , 1958 , when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas .	81.74184
he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency ' ' .	5.3367352
as we see , pope may appeal to president sukarno , khrushchev ' s friend , for clemency .	42.55103
the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban freedom fighters .	67.89894
but who will act now and immediately to save the life of alan pope ? ?	140.50069
does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-communist american pilot ? ?	91.869194
a few days before i saw your mention of what texas liberals were doing to promote `` louis capet ' ' ( the week ' ' , june 3 ) , another analogy had occurred to me .	107.37565
`` with no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he was the government ' ' .	84.13949
`` a ' dust-settling ' period of decadence and decline ' ' .	31.08795
`` he opened his mouth , said little , and thought not at all ' ' .	30.074545
`` not completely virtuous , but completely incompetent ' ' .	5.520871
truly , that liberals should choose louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic , considering the louis 14 , character of their grand monarque , fdr not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies .	90.20826
in defeating `` louis capet ' ' , john tower ' s victory in texas signals , once again , the end of the divine right of liberalism .	102.969
it seems to me that n . c . , in his editorial `` confrontation ' ' ( sr , mar . 25 ) , has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer ? ?	87.51443
this affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress .	59.165157
i know of no other solution than the one n . c . proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place .	115.014046
never have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically .	154.5632
thank you for the illustrated editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	3.9853191
it is both great writing and profound religion .	10.356705
n . c . has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece .	239.34915
i feel that n . c . hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	49.72726
my only hope is that it will be shared by many , many others .	148.22568
`` confrontation ' ' should fortify us all , whether in southeast asia or the u . s . .	21.095598
congratulations to n . c . for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the peace corps .	40.369453
i concur that it is necessary for americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands .	81.749985
it would be heartbreaking to see idealism , and hence effective leadership , thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into .	137.20143
the editorial `` confrontation ' ' was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in america .	147.48827
thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world .	178.30702
n . c . ' s editorial `` confrontation ' ' is a stunning piece of writing .	34.03316
i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone entering the peace corps to read it .	41.992733
the important people to humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros but the schweitzers and the dooleys , and the others like them whose names we will never know .	178.356
editor ' s note reprints of `` confrontation ' ' will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the peace corps .	55.590508
a peace corps official described the editorial as `` precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers ' ' .	50.688667
f . l . lucas ' s article in sr ' s april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new english bible .	56.9186
i certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers , rather than the comment by cleveland amory in his first of the month column .	69.62456
it is blind , fundamentalist dogmatism to say , `` messing around with the king james version seems to us a perilous sport at best ' ' .	95.470146
lester markel is on the right track in his article `` interpretation of interpretation ' ' ( sr , mar . 11 ) .	35.525627
the current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact , fancy , and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago .	160.40869
we don ' t need this type of protection any more .	1049.7356
the public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media .	277.16046
besides , there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about .	96.76622
the accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities .	107.75649
a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for instance , is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute .	69.464584
second , it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous .	54.83594
the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation .	379.05045
yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns .	161.12186
despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating .	101.50084
the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions .	207.32274
it seems to me the time has come for the american press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends .	105.33201
the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors .	60.619267
i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president kennedy ' s activities , so far as southern california is concerned .	99.77424
you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions .	139.37766
to begin with , the all-powerful los angeles times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences .	71.67082
i am sure that they did when eisenhower was president .	40.414513
next , because of the time differential , the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day .	49.392666
up until now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 p . m . or sometimes 7 or 10 30 p . m . .	37.90789
even then , a few of the `` less interesting ' ' questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator .	115.65447
however , last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into their programs .	164.74686
this is no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary .	356.31458
the radio stations did run `` transcripts ' ' ( i thought ) during the evening hours .	61.11024
however , by comparing the tv snatches , two different radio station re-runs , and the censored los angeles times version , i found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( abc removed the one regarding laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president ' s answer .	129.20203
i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the `` abuse ' ' he is being subjected to .	71.02818
we out here don ' t see enough of the conference to know he is being abused .	176.58221
i don ' t know if this is the situation in other parts of the country	73.85017
it also happened with the inauguration , which was not re-run at all during the evening hours , and i wrote to the tv editor of the times .	56.732605
he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations ' not doing this -- but nothing happened .	173.57993
can you bring the networks ' attention to this ? ?	105.03915
i was interested in james webb young ' s madison avenue column in which he raised the question `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	56.24542
and the sad part of it is that we had one , which was rounding into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die .	120.53432
during the war , we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black and white and the various shades of grey in between .	98.11887
we had a couple of schools in this country , the principal one being on the marshall field estate out in lloyd ' s neck .	60.82876
there were also a couple in canada , and several in england .	165.76639
the english schools preceded ours , and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching .	107.84423
four of us here in the united states attended , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in england , canada , and the united states .	102.624954
we set up the lloyd ' s neck school , worked out its curriculum , and taught there .	270.89255
toward the end of the war , we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it .	133.55211
when the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust .	117.07352
we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so .	276.5995
there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare .	36.841843
a study at the pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there .	181.23106
and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way .	77.99596
congratulations on the article `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	22.09594
this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years , and i certainly hope it sparks some action .	123.312126
many of us in public relations were flattered that richard l . tobin chose to devote his editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger of the public relations society of america and the american public relations association .	93.974915
i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published .	136.43272
whether in his forthcoming book c . p . snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important .	110.44128
one should be able to get hold of the book at once .	64.23854
but the attack was made from an advance copy .	92.17037
if this practice should take root and spread , the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality .	278.66547
editor ' s note sir robert watson-watt wrote , on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961	433.0651
`` i have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled , ' science and government .	226.70535
until the work actually appears i am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail .	32.846294
but i have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin lectures at harvard , from which the book was derived , and i can with confidence challenge the gist of c . p . snow ' s incautious tale ' ' .	87.82763
watson-watt ' s remarks in sr did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures .	70.01127
representatives of harvard university press , which is publishing the book this month of april , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book ' s publication date .	149.55363
the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt .	56.320484
sir robert watson-watt ' s `` rebuttal ' ' of sir charles snow ' s godkin lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself from sir charles ' supposed falsehoods while stating those `` falsehoods ' ' in an unclear incoherent argument .	121.08445
the article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning .	49.66709
it calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike ' ' a `` perverted conclusion .	93.05172
it submits an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing another aspect of the man , but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles ' account .	182.8128
we are left to choose between the two lindemanns .	481.1802
the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party .	38.223984
but we are to believe that lindemann actively supported radar outside the tizard committee , and dissembling , discounted it inside ? ?	340.00034
if so , i would lean to sir charles ' conception of the man .	77.30144
i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time .	55.134262
to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it .	70.8178
it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the violin .	39.6675
certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless recitals , and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the chicago symphony orchestra , playing the brahms concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed .	73.52764
there was about that song something incandescent , for this brahms was milstein at white heat .	356.99942
not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent .	131.82704
those would be reserved for the orchestra ' s great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .	96.712944
this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood .	279.53027
but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .	157.47063
that is , when mr . milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , mr . hendl could go along .	93.796875
but mr . hendl does not go straight to any point .	55.17747
there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion .	122.72183
so we had some dazzling and memorable milstein , but not great brahms .	57.278507
the concert opened with another big romantic score , schumann ' s overture to `` manfred ' ' , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic point to keep it afloat .	73.947914
hindemith ' s joust with weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands transluscent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit .	111.41119
it got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style .	115.40458
the bayreuth festival opens july 23 with a new production of `` tannhaeuser ' ' staged by wieland wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch .	57.1384
sawalisch also conducts `` the flying dutch ' ' , opening july 24 .	31.335234
`` parsifal ' ' follows july 25 , with hans knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` die meistersinger ' ' , to be presented aug . 8 and 12 .	47.743004
the `` ring ' ' cycles are july 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and aug . 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 .	39.192566
no casts are listed , but lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano , grace bumbry , will sing venus in `` tannhaeuser ' ' .	36.74847
remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago missed seeing the bolshoi ballet ? ?	130.39003
remember how by lack of two big theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet ? ?	75.61015
well , now we have two big theaters .	9.089223
but barring a miracle , and don ' t hold your breath for it , chicago will not see the leningrad-kirov ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world .	90.39798
before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did .	348.8069
the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in mccormick place , which sol hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he doesn ' t weep at the capacity , either .	71.98521
allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates as dec . 4 thru 10 .	94.5529
later the hurok office made it dec . 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory .	87.279465
but if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict .	83.98453
allied arts had booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec . 8 and 9 .	34.787083
allied arts then notified us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking , fly here to open nov . 28 , and close dec . 2 .	91.159
a couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake ' ' .	74.33195
so i started making some calls of my own .	22.32828
the kirov ballet is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium , los angeles , nov . 21 thru dec . 4 .	40.553455
not a chance of opening here nov . 28 -- barring that miracle .	284.98355
then why not the juicy booking hurok had held for us ? ?	182.31277
well , dietrich won ' t budge from mccormick place .	50.000515
then how about the civic opera house ? ?	1.1298817
well , allied arts has booked lena horne there for a week starting dec . 4 .	68.30378
queried about the impasse , allied arts said `` better cancel the kirov for the time being .	225.01558
it ' s all up in the air again ' ' .	18.336702
so the kirov will fly back to russia , minus a chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country .	74.95213
paintings and drawings by marie moore of st . thomas , virgin islands , are shown thru nov . 5 at the meadows gallery , 3211 ellis av . , week days , 3 p . m . to 8 p . m . , sundays 3 p . m . to 6 p . m . , closed mondays .	42.927692
an exhibition of evelyn cibula ' s paintings will open with a reception nov . 5 at the evanston community center , 828 davis st . .	152.75368
abstractions and semi-abstractions by everett mcnear are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame until nov . 5 .	92.75761
in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the dallas civic opera will use san francisco ' s new leni bauer-ecsy production of `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' this season , returning the favor next season when san francisco uses the dallas `` don giovanni ' ' , designed by franco zeffirelli .	61.172634
h e . bates has scribbled a farce called `` hark , hark , the lark ' ' ! !	42.17579
it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season .	65.95241
if there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find .	28.67148
perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics .	93.54857
anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions .	409.02753
one is an imperial london stockbroker called jerebohm .	3.1383877
another is a wily countryman called larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , i believe , in earlier volumes of mr . bates ' comedie humaine .	205.64902
well , jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities .	71.60988
they want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers .	135.35622
they are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at .	127.51946
and of course larkin has just the thing they want .	47.39171
the name of it is gore court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress t . s . eliot .	143.08665
that ' s not precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it , though .	66.06414
he conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air .	77.53681
he suggests that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor .	31.769327
the stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform .	68.100426
the vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch .	175.0816
the spaciousness of the tudor cooking areas , for example , will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .	160.06601
also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented .	139.57259
it ' s a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse .	241.89204
he doesn ' t really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from american gold on the london exchange ) he makes them pay .	237.29375
for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot .	281.24814
he has a glorious wife and many children .	10.869016
when he needs money to buy something like , say , the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch , he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies .	166.85466
one of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with gore court .	384.6295
he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands .	30.863794
and the jerebohms are more than willing to buy it .	30.454689
they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox ' s life on earth .	42.06768
if , in larkin ' s eyes , they are nothing but piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living .	149.78508
mr . bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc .	1011.2022
oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war .	381.31177
first the larkins are ahead , then the jerebohms .	315.8865
after larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers .	137.76811
one of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from kipling ' s tales of india , does not approve of the way larkin gets his birds .	233.95062
he doesn ' t think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting .	57.77528
but the brigadier dines on the birds with relish .	49.32774
it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from miguel de cervantes ' `` don quixote ' ' is the brilliant russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street playhouses .	109.85198
more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , sancho panza , in seventeenth-century spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character .	89.18838
nikolai cherkasov , the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander nevsky and ivan the terrible , performs the lanky don quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man .	112.97318
his addle-brained knight-errant , self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues .	203.45813
cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .	57.218998
he treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .	54.586914
directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .	141.79941
the complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the russian dialogue .	72.500336
the voices of all the characters , including that of cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities .	103.05796
and the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed .	203.03256
since russian was being spoken instead of spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here .	112.791565
splendid , too , is the performance of yuri tolubeyev , one of russia ' s leading comedians , as sancho panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire ' ' .	34.15935
though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too .	102.1768
it is really as though the russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons .	151.82628
the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island ' ' is one of the best in the film .	94.40167
true , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before don quixote goes to the duke ' s court .	88.17222
but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy .	80.16761
there are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange .	59.510487
also on the bill at the fifty-fifth street is a nice ten-minute color film called `` sunday in greenwich village ' ' , a tour of the haunts and joints .	55.613445
television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family .	79.05079
there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary .	141.65208
at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` chicago and all that jazz ' ' , presented on nbc-tv nov . 26 .	72.98198
the program came out of the nbc special projects department , and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series .	115.73099
perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .	6.825643
if so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents .	98.46514
as a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results .	50.904045
a few years ago a `` timex all-star jazz show ' ' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from lionel hampton ' s big band to the free-wheeling dukes of dixieland .	51.611618
an enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live ' ' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .	122.04525
about that same time john crosby ' s tv series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .	187.03282
in an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .	43.46314
the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .	63.753708
cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work .	108.093
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' could not be faulted on the choice of artists .	55.432407
some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden , gene krupa , bud freeman , pee wee russell , johnny st . cyr , joe sullivan , red allen , lil armstrong , blossom seeley .	63.8644
the jazz buff could hardly ask for more .	38.593937
furthermore , garry moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies .	250.41437
( he played host at the timex show already mentioned .	77.12967
one of the script ' s big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today .	190.32524
nbc had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share .	37.09319
for example , there was sheet music with the word `` jazz ' ' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold .	136.68425
samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 ' s .	150.5924
however well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening ' s main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the chicago style .	156.92747
another source of nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse .	161.56561
similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal .	109.851715
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .	610.74384
by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today ' s artists , the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either .	91.33512
still , the network ' s willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .	171.66634
even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending her debut as lucia in donizetti ' s `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' sunday night .	67.77254
the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic `` mad scene ' ' created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .	102.57407
her entrance in scene 2 , act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note .	107.85802
thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization .	162.54297
as she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` lucia ' ' .	116.8091
each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` mad scene ' ' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .	56.03934
miss sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene a much more girlish lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .	156.1567
what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today .	140.14572
this big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined .	59.898434
nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm up slowly .	161.1761
in the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .	95.84755
technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic .	77.76253
many years have passed since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable .	695.92
her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine .	257.1076
the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , silvio varviso .	49.73806
he injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .	86.905
he may respect too much the italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers ' opera may be quite difficult .	154.5983
his bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction .	320.03555
the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable .	250.52843
miss sutherland first sang lucia at covent garden in 1959 .	105.57438
( the first metropolitan opera broadcast on dec . 9 will introduce her as lucia .	79.5123
) she has since turned to bellini , whose opera `` beatrice di tenda ' ' in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her to new york last season .	113.30982
she will sing `` la sonambula ' ' with it here next week .	172.12329
it ' s really quite fun -- as long as you like games .	322.7675
you will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new london `` phase 4 ' ' records .	145.29712
there are 12 of these to choose from , all of them of popular music except for the star release , pass in review ( sp-44001 ) .	134.47191
this features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand .	168.31558
complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays london ' s new technique to the best effect .	200.71846
all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program .	138.1465
no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music .	162.00325
but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music .	86.523895
you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back .	225.79955
this is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound .	163.32603
london explains that the very distinct directional effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .	198.6985
these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record .	101.01059
in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects .	163.3385
some clue to the character of london ' s approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion ' ' or `` percussive ' ' .	78.59075
drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well .	29.95961
only too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right .	93.47049
they are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley .	116.21358
the percussive twenties ( sp-44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and johnny keating ' s kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive moods ( sp-44005 ) .	133.61319
big band percussion ( sp-44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just didn ' t have so much character as the others .	162.4087
there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies .	94.213295
the penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in melody and percussion for two pianos ( sp-44007 ) .	85.8777
all of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface noise .	139.33273
pass in review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system .	69.632256
many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic .	34.78544
strange , but true -- authenticity and realism often aren ' t related at all .	82.34728
almost every film bearing the imprimatur of hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so .	78.33917
in any given period piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity .	74.70953
the major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter .	81.088196
during the making recently of an important biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with .	105.284904
but , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set ' s edge .	58.356693
the drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all .	172.00998
the storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic .	8.70928
thus , in `` the story of ruth ' ' we have ruth , naomi , and boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic .	80.51876
but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i . e . , that ruth remained with naomi and finally wound up with boaz -- the film version has little to do with the bible .	132.20863
and in the new `` king of kings ' ' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the gospels .	87.552574
earlier this month edward r . murrow , director of the united states information agency , came to hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry .	113.63762
he intimated that they weren ' t doing the country much good in the cold war .	75.37973
and to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .	207.45088
`` in many corners of the globe ' ' , he said , `` the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet .	57.019897
would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge ? ?	98.05718
yet for much of the globe , hollywood is just that -- prime , if not sole , source of knowledge .	172.79613
if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone , what conclusions do you think he might come to ? ?	315.03574
francois d ' albert , hungarian-born violinist who made his new york debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in judson hall .	84.93926
he is now president of the chicago conservatory college .	115.45308
his pianist was donald jenni , a faculty member at depaul university .	22.105846
the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , mr . jenni ' s playing was too loud .	72.32204
in vying with him , mr . d ' albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone .	106.510124
this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , mozart ' s sonata in a ( k . 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion .	72.73411
brahm ' s sonata in a , although also vigorous , stood up well under the two artists ' strong , large-scale treatment .	213.80066
mr . d ' albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato .	132.56416
he made the most of the long brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance .	182.80452
a sonata for violin and piano , called `` bella bella ' ' , by robert fleming , was given its first united states performance .	84.39404
the title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the national film board of canada .	38.896717
the work ' s two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom .	157.39067
they might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of hollywood .	695.7285
works by dohnanyi , hubay , mr . d ' albert himself and paganini , indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase .	102.07833
standard items by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program .	375.20844
in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium , but her program last night at town hall was the greek-born pianist ' s first new york recital since 1948 .	73.09472
miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control .	126.357124
and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound .	95.48239
since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure .	72.223885
she played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures .	246.85297
the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers of this century .	84.19596
it was in them that miss xydis was at her best .	101.18008
the rachmaninoff prelude no . 12 , op . 32 , for instance , gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble .	137.12634
the four kabalevsky preludes were also assured , rich in color and songful .	424.88168
and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that prokofieff needs .	330.46176
miss xydis ' earlier selections were mendelssohn ' s variations serieuses , in which each variation was nicely set off from the others	154.10062
haydn ' s sonata in e minor , which was unfailingly pleasant in sound , and chopin ' s sonata in b flat minor .	86.1316
a memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist ' s performance .	39.331676
so , what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing .	291.21625
miss xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing .	19.54061
all the generals who held important commands in world war 2 , did not write books .	51.056156
and the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written .	138.53702
one of the very best is only now published in this country , five years after its first publication in england .	81.438446
it is `` defeat into victory ' ' , by field marshal viscount slim .	36.333252
a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally .	225.6677
field marshal slim has abridged it for the benefit of `` those who , finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , are more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger ' ' .	138.62749
the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the field marshal himself .	47.455956
william joseph slim , first viscount slim , former governor general of australia , was the principal british commander in the field during the burma war .	52.675323
he had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped british forces `` were outmaneuvered , outfought and outgeneraled ' ' .	132.64632
he returned in command of an international army of gurkhas , indians , africans , chinese and british .	49.51765
and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war .	67.12038
`` the forgotten war ' ' his soldiers called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines .	158.72006
parts of `` defeat into victory ' ' are a tangle of burmese place names and military units , but a little application makes everything clear enough .	154.05418
on the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book .	118.57832
field marshal slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes .	184.1091
he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even `` a cardinal error ' ' .	175.46655
he himself seems to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers .	158.5674
`` defeat into victory ' ' is a dramatic and lively military narrative .	183.62198
but it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action .	155.20412
before he could return to burma , field marshal slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits .	55.03702
his remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening .	92.18928
he believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many .	43.981827
he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there .	140.12888
for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers , when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly .	169.12782
other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale was vital , too	120.8051
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with top brass -- british , american and chinese	236.44788
health , hygiene , medical aid and preventive medicine	1.6691921
hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty )	14.408455
commenting on these and other matters , field marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks	223.7811
`` when in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder ' ' .	99.72996
`` the commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty ' ' .	127.96162
`` it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them .	351.15692
so i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it ' ' .	29.005625
field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders .	159.19455
of the japanese private he says `` he fought and marched till he died .	87.7283
if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position , we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves ' ' .	76.84652
brooding about future wars , the field marshal has this to say `` the asian fighting man is at least equally brave ( as the white ) , usually more careless of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him .	163.02266
he is , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources ' ' .	92.76933
a bunch of young buckaroos from out west , who go by the name of texas boys choir , loped into town hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience .	77.44086
actually , the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sang it beautifully .	175.52623
under the capable direction of the choir ' s founder , geroge bragg , the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from pergolesi ' s `` stabat mater ' ' and all of the britten `` ceremonial of carols ' ' .	58.049744
their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing .	190.05174
the limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now and then a bleat .	58.952618
but mr . bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior .	123.59716
most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words .	131.62729
the latin , for example , was not only clear	126.21297
furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music .	25.242685
lines came out neatly and in good balance .	5.9910393
the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish .	3.9521196
a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly .	71.405266
other capable soloists included david clifton , joseph schockler and pat thompson .	48.67928
the final group included folk songs from back home , stomped out , shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume .	124.66197
boys will be boys , and texans will be texans .	85.54216
the polish song and dance company called mazowsze , after the region of poland , where it has its headquarters , opened a three-week engagement at the city center last night .	112.585655
a thoroughly ingratiating company it is , and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening .	111.99207
not that it is all funny , by any means , though some of it is definitely so , but simply that the dancers are young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied .	69.6388
there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it has a kind of nonstop format , and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification .	123.494774
the material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of poland .	81.08595
but under the direction of mira ziminska-sygietynska , who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treated selectively , choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators , and performed altogether professionally .	233.11043
under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing .	172.47609
since the organization was created thirteen years ago , it is obvious that this is not the original company	43.207047
it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company .	305.0721
the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters .	60.811184
indeed , there are never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that is only for the more intimate numbers .	52.068127
they can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull .	70.10953
to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed .	147.12555
there is , for example , a stunning krakowiak that closes the first act	290.67032
the mazurka choreographed by witold zapala to music from moniuszko ' s opera , `` strasny dwor ' , may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see	135.07825
and the dances and songs from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men .	149.4128
everywhere there are little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth .	70.3597
the theatre-by-the-sea , matunuck , presents `` king of hearts ' ' by jean kerr and eleanor brooke .	65.11032
producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season ' s opener at matunuck in jean kerr ' s `` king of hearts ' ' .	53.971607
the dialogue is sharp , witty and candid -- typical `` don ' t eat the daisies ' ' material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience liked it .	108.002525
the story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material .	138.59993
this is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero ' s sweetheart-secretary .	85.35905
john heffernan , playing larry larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion .	113.29254
his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless .	299.10355
this may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of david hedison , providence ' s contribution to hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th century-fox .	86.22801
not that mr . hedison does not make the most of his role .	73.02825
but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way .	34.45856
a word should be said for gary morgan , a broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and larkin in particular .	211.79634
and for his playmate , francis coletta of west warwick , who has a bit part , billy .	125.248215
on the whole , audiences will like this performance .	90.259674
it is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the matunuck cast does well by it .	296.51483
the newport playhouse presents `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' by john osborne and anthony creighton , directed by wallace gray .	27.241714
the angriest young man in newport last night was at the playhouse , where `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' opened as the jazz festival closed .	75.509346
for the hero of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session .	59.05196
he ' s mad at a world he did not make .	38.877213
furthermore , he ' s something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips .	111.48272
this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards .	351.72336
they not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well .	180.04112
it is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that george dillon enters at the beginning of the play .	99.343094
an unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists .	277.58438
by the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells .	130.25883
not altogether a successful play , `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling .	133.20822
it is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive .	69.962685
but it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .	111.91591
there is a fine second act , as an example , one in which samuel groom , as dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another .	69.571625
this is an exciting young actor to watch .	18.355637
just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch .	271.99182
miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment .	195.01817
also fine are sue lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , harold cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and hildy weissman , as a vegetable in human form .	117.29647
wallace gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste .	156.74388
still , his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair .	152.14177
the warwick musical theater presents `` where ' s charley ? ?	14.629673
' ' with music and lyrics by frank loesser , directed by christopher hewett , choreography by peter conlow , musical direction by samuel matlowsky .	44.496536
everybody fell in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater , and shelley berman was to blame .	41.89791
one of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented , `` once in love with amy ' ' is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of american musical comedy in our era .	74.27161
so the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 , got a rousing opening chorus , `` where ' s charley ? ?	119.721146
' ' , and berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being .	228.18098
it is greatly to berman ' s credit that he made no attempt to outdo ray bolger .	45.457047
he dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called `` charley ' s aunt ' ' , and let himself go with as appealing an `` amy ' ' as anybody could ask .	84.57778
in brief , berman played himself and not bolger .	503.73752
the big audience started applauding even before he had finished .	24.312468
the whole production this week is fresh and lively .	104.906845
the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days .	184.17749
the ballet work is on the nose , especially in the opening number by `` the new ashmolean marching society and students ' conservatory band ' ' , along with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later .	106.799194
berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy .	134.01537
sparrow-size virginia gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky amy , while melisande congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best gibson girl manner .	219.49391
all told , `` where ' s charley ? ?	5.1160502
it has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , mr . berman .	72.239075
the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c . edwin knill ' s and martin tahse ' s production of `` fiorello ! !	43.220802
the book is by jerome weidman and george abbott , music by jerry bock , lyrics by sheldon harnick , choreography by peter gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by william and jean eckart , musical direction by jack elliott , and the production was directed by mr . abbott .	74.040955
this is one of the happier events of the season .	21.078691
the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the little flower rides to break a lance again .	162.54018
' ' performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company is every bit as good , and perhaps better .	257.11523
certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking .	95.95337
bob carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley does , but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch one ' s self up and remember that this wasn ' t really laguardia come back among us again .	103.26984
then rudy bond was simply grand as ben , the distraught republican party district chieftain .	76.85041
and paul lipson , as morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his shirley ' s dinner , was fine , too .	129.8179
as for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man .	136.38622
charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie , who became the second mrs . laguardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction .	219.10597
jen nelson , as thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive .	189.39377
and little zeme north , a dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings .	155.15883
such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` on the side of the angels ' ' and `` politics and poker ' ' were handled splendidly , and i thought rudy bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` little tin box ' ' even better than it was done by the new york cast	67.416435
all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity .	213.79108
the party at floyd ' s penthouse gave the `` chorines ' ' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era ' s nonsense .	72.32338
laguardia ' s multi-lingual rallies , when he is running for congress , are well staged , and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater .	137.45067
martin tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions .	45.716812
not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .	137.94073
the sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that doesn ' t pause long in any one place , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness .	69.88606
( several times recently i have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes .	123.0454
i ' m glad to say there ' s none of that distraction in this `` fiorello ! !	61.336727
it has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater .	113.31204
loew ' s theater presents `` where the boys are ' ' , an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells .	121.902405
since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich brown senior , while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists , i suppose i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` where the boys are ' ' , but i shall do nothing of the sort .	88.93642
instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- i hasten to report that it ' s a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say , sex .	96.71609
the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .	224.83176
if most of them weren ' t exactly specific -- well , that ' s the way it is in life , i guess .	113.62303
but at least it ' s reassuring to see some teenagers who don ' t profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead .	69.26953
`` where the boys are ' ' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .	53.245094
there are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid ' ' is performing .	127.63608
most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar .	85.53715
dolores hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable .	107.35655
i was delighted with paula prentiss ' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one ' s highest hopes might ask .	262.81033
a couple of the males made good comedy , too -- jim hutton and frank gorshin .	90.54021
the only performance which was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , i suppose this was the attitude the part called for .	176.79951
i must say , however , that i preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it .	142.24129
to anyone who remembers newport at its less than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertaining .	132.22202
the second feature , `` the price of silence ' ' , is a british detective story that will talk your head off .	105.39124
the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters .	45.983555
here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking .	158.95645
to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment .	229.93266
for this latest addition to the great letters series , under the general editorship of louis kronenberger , miss hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of james ' s genius , not to mention the felicities of his style .	126.62391
his famous criticism of brother henry ' s `` third style ' ' is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter ' s intricate air castles as henry himself could ever have produced .	156.4443
his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor .	315.70325
most of all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain whitehead ' s reference to james as `` that adorable genius ' ' .	71.03154
miss hardwick speaks of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship ' ' , and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism .	97.98426
this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought .	188.71703
it holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual ' ' has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues .	89.81814
to his harvard colleague , josiah royce , whose philosophic position differed radically from his own , james could write , `` different as our minds are , yours has nourished mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you i have always felt that my life was being lived importantly ' ' .	149.6142
of another colleague , george santayana , he could write `` the great event in my life recently has been the reading of santayana ' s book .	74.55213
although i absolutely reject the platonism of it , i have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page ' ' .	91.04983
writing to his colleague george herbert palmer -- `` glorious old palmer ' ' , as he addresses him -- james says that if only the students at harvard could really understand royce , santayana , palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for ' ' , then harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe .	176.8098
`` the best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems .	96.53114
the world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other ' ' .	81.04486
the `` belaboring ' ' is of course jocular , yet james was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of god .	214.0272
to james this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of it in others .	113.16436
but there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent `` you ask what i am going to ' reply ' to bradley .	102.56395
but why need one reply to everything and everybody ? ?	34.710854
i think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations .	88.031105
all polemic of ours should , i believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treated singly , and as far as possible impersonally .	121.41029
as far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other .	217.45395
here again ' god will know his own ' ' ' .	12.010745
the collected works of james thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows .	217.77843
the primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall , is equally well known .	184.3339
about all that remains to be said is that the present selection , most of which appeared first in the new yorker , comprises ( as usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book .	93.9289
the one unifying note , if any , is sounded in the initial article entitled `` how to get through the day ' ' .	58.000877
it is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and others forced to rely on inner resources , including ( in the p ' s alone ) `` palindromes ' ' , `` paraphrases ' ' , and `` parodies ' ' .	88.43589
`` the tyranny of trivia ' ' suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber .	112.38516
and new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled `` friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ear-muffs ' ' , `` such a phrase as drifts through dream ' ' , and `` the new vocabularianism ' ' .	67.05166
some of thurber ' s curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases .	96.619934
a burlesque paean entitled `` hark the herald tribune , times , and all the other angels sing ' ' brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey .	50.738457
`` how the kooks crumble ' ' features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-tv commercials , and `` the watchers of the night ' ' is a veritable waking nightmare .	84.22872
a semi-serious literary document entitled `` the wings of henry james ' ' is noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master ' s difficult later period by modest owen wister , author of `` the virginian ' ' .	90.48297
james , he remarks in a letter to a friend , `` is attempting the impossible namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produces upon the gazer , a number of superimposed , simultaneous impressions .	81.53583
he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once , and get all at once , the various shadings and complexities ' ' .	84.18316
equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation `` so much has already been written about everything that you can ' t find out anything about it ' ' .	74.10336
or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) `` woman ' s place is in the wrong ' ' .	29.309746
who but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences ? ?	284.68204
a tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes ' ' seems terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why .	53.561546
`` one of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped out of sleep and out of bed .	205.43448
' it ' s just a bat ' , said my wife reassuringly , and i sighed with relief .	144.10255
' thank god for that ' , i said	142.00064
' i thought it was a human being ' ' ' .	31.211231
in a sense , perhaps , thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it salvador dali ? ?	98.42637
) who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen .	57.046604
that is , it is literally a picture window you don ' t see into the viscera	41.564472
you see a picture -- trees , or flowers .	163.52357
this is something like what thurber ' s best effects are like , if i am not mistaken .	202.45947
though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness .	256.14105
in his concluding paragraph he writes `` the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can ' ' .	121.4451
for many readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight .	30.188028
the master ' s hand has lost none of its craft .	153.28267
he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties .	65.785126
the reader meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse , and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race , her hair standing straight out .	135.8799
but there is a difference between the present volume and the early low .	163.55814
there is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show .	199.55466
but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning .	240.47174
anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference .	245.54143
it might be argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key .	98.01814
but this argument cannot be pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion .	171.74632
the communists wield a power unknown to hitler .	23.942055
and the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same .	102.05838
do we ourselves offer mr . low less of a crusade ? ?	114.29604
in the thirties we would not face our enemy	55.45049
that was a nightmarish situation and low was in his element .	222.26271
we are stronger and more self-confident -- and low cannot so easily put us to rights .	206.2813
or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere ? ?	41.62318
it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now .	74.18281
he writes , `` confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime ' ' .	267.79617
whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic .	40.99605
he does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man .	18.381063
the skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath .	92.65156
low seems to have supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently , so there is no fire in his eye .	201.35219
stalin ' s death , churchill ' s farewell to public life , hillary and tensing on everest , quemoy and matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade .	226.18803
instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles .	2.7609534
did low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections ? ?	67.83361
he showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines .	5.4666996
and khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all .	80.496185
look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale .	114.36713
read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas .	124.50164
a gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man , city slicker , lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over catfish bend in this third relaxed allegory from mr . burman ' s refreshing louisiana animal community .	154.7788
the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from new orleans , accompanied by one wharf rat .	63.44432
but like all despots , as he builds his following from among the gullible , he grows more threatening toward those who won ' t follow -- such solid citizens as doc raccoon	300.44968
and the eagle , who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in washington posing for fifty-cent pieces .	222.10327
as soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats , who , of course , say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city .	82.30591
( the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others .	118.93962
) they train the mink and other animals to fight .	58.154438
and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won ' t have anyone around that ' s against him , and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds .	106.463974
robert hillyer , the poet , writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that mr . burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish bend series .	82.23553
he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes .	279.31454
but it ' s hard to imagine mr . burman as a nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables .	60.089905
in substance they lie somewhere between the southern dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris ( uncle remus ) and the polished , witty fables of james thurber .	80.32361
george kennan ' s account of relations between russia and the west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 , is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years .	59.068436
it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era ' s great historical issues .	95.489624
in short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at harvard university , is both reliable and readable	77.95443
the author possesses an uncommonly fine english style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time .	69.62326
if mr . kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging .	113.55263
mr . kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken .	80.14758
but he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the yalta conference in february , 1945 .	67.418625
after all , alger hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret state department documents to soviet agents , was at yalta .	137.3998
and harry dexter white , implicated in f . b . i . reports in communist associations , was one of the architects of the morgenthau plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed germany to stalin .	98.103065
one item in this unhappy scheme was to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength .	136.15222
it is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender ' ' had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with communism .	85.09591
mr . kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way	348.90503
`` you see , first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy ' s power , no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future ' ' .	92.6304
recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with hitler , he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-nazi underground , which very nearly eliminated hitler in 1944 .	197.33797
a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language , history and literature , kennan recalls how , at the time of hitler ' s attack on the soviet union in 1941 , he penned a private note to a state department official , expressing the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries ' ' .	60.511257
with justified bitterness the author speaks of `` what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happened in the purges , and about what had been going on in poland and the baltic states ' ' .	63.095654
he also speaks of franklin d . roosevelt ' s `` puerile ' ' assumption that `` if only he ( stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like f . d . r . himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and russia ' s co-operation with the west could be easily arranged ' ' .	106.19272
no wonder khrushchev ' s first message to president kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days ' ' of roosevelt .	70.754105
this fascinating story begins with a sketch , rich in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of world war 1 , and the two instalments of the russian revolution .	79.35538
the first of these involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government in march , 1917	99.91316
the second , the seizure of power by the bolsheviks ( who later called themselves communists ) in november of the same year .	133.47462
as kennan shows , the judgment of the allied governments about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession of defeating germany .	70.28378
they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fighting .	141.59886
they attributed everything that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue .	52.11089
this , more than any other factor , led to the fiasco of allied intervention .	38.05828
`` had a world war not been in progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have been an allied intervention in north russia ' ' .	45.24166
the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by communist propaganda	64.79898
here kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking .	46.108803
of many passages in the book that exemplify the author ' s vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected .	97.35173
`` this was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits	421.61624
a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity	90.85362
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe	22327.207
a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment	41.450195
a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime .	110.91965
and here is kennan ' s image of hitler , stalin ' s temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy	88.467735
`` behind that charlie chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed -- like stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift stalin did not possess the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word ' ' .	148.05458
two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan .	97.76692
and in a concluding chapter about america ' s stance in the contemporary world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war .	135.79303
mr . kennan , who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia , is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future .	91.45815
the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator .	88.4065
the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm .	242.12294
in `` donnybrook ' ' , there is quite a different eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing are the thing .	341.06717
there is plenty of violence , to be sure , but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed .	73.493706
by and large , robert mcenroe ' s adaptation of maurice walsh ' s film , `` the quiet man ' ' , provides the entertainment it set out to , and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one .	135.90277
this is the tale of one john enright , an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man .	118.8246
but innesfree , where ellen roe danaher and her bullying brother , will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists .	86.653
so enright ' s courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told .	323.15094
you may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means .	127.70268
then there is a matchmaker , one mikeen flynn , a role for which eddie foy was happily selected .	109.793236
now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play .	112.7472
mr . foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect .	222.67845
his matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony .	115.58958
art lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonates enright .	50.234592
although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique , that ' s not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have , anyway .	74.62775
joan fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays ellen , and sings the role very well , too .	137.71576
if the mettle which ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind	204.68245
she fits into the general scheme well enough .	34.367924
susan johnson , as the widow , spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one .	97.65505
she has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening .	59.583973
then there are a pair of old biddies played by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock irish characters , but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they ' re quite entertaining .	196.37619
and in the role of will danaher , philip bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british army , if he chose .	261.60278
`` donnybrook ' ' is no `` brigadoon ' ' , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing .	69.31434
the ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent .	205.20432
it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of it , such as the catchy `` sez i ' ' , does .	67.56663
`` a toast to the bride ' ' , sung by clarence nordstrom , playing a character called old man toomey , is quite simple , direct and touching .	80.0666
the men of innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing is fine .	57.46374
so is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under jack cole ' s expert choreographic direction .	149.98999
the male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating .	267.5506
rouben ter-arutunian , in his stage settings , often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr . cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow .	194.25285
there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at `` donnybrook ' ' , unless they are permanently in the mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable irish .	92.324814
we can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously , too -- because joshua logan has turned the stage show , `` fanny ' ' , into a delightful and heart-warming film .	92.45587
the task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnol ' s original trio of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting them again on the screen , after their passage through the broadway musical idiom , was a delicate and perilous one , indeed .	100.91671
more than the fans of pagnol ' s old films and of their heroic star , the great raimu , were looking askance at the project .	211.02837
the fans of the musical were , too .	13.952741
but now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music hall yesterday .	149.2128
whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show , whether partial to music or not , you can ' t help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart .	110.15607
some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow .	168.34865
a tiny handful never did make the concert .	10.405711
but , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon ' s proceedings .	80.05755
they faced a rather small audience , as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon .	92.98643
paul paray , rounding out his current stint with the orchestra , is a solid musician , and the philharmonic plays for him .	60.15688
their collaboration in the beethoven second symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding .	180.00044
it was not a heavy , ponderous beethoven .	29.094425
the music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced .	316.56522
the franck symphonic poem , `` psyche ' ' , is a lush , sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again .	68.42335
fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor	209.37984
if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying .	531.7797
mr . paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score .	94.892334
he did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical .	112.51943
his interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy .	154.8882
and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto , with zadel skolovsky as soloist , he was an admirable partner .	70.15484
mr . skolovsky ' s approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive .	109.78113
he swept through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner .	261.92395
an impressive technician , mr . skolovsky has fine rhythm , to boot .	81.03443
his tone is the weakest part of his equipment	4251.4717
a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs .	254.58266
it is , after all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement )	136.93294
and the composer himself was called the `` age of steel pianist ' ' .	103.55248
but granted all this , one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than mr . skolovsky supplied .	137.31956
taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra .	102.04121
mr . skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received .	217.3675
a new work on the program was nikolai lopatnikoff ' s `` festival overture ' ' , receiving its first new york hearing .	32.90544
this was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry .	54.145126
it runs a little more than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless .	94.887314
`` la gioconda ' ' , like it or not , is a singer ' s opera .	62.759224
and so , of course , it is a fan ' s opera as well .	52.132534
snow or no , the fans were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work .	53.409683
so the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing .	76.32329
after all , the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed , with no less than six leading parts .	131.60287
one of those parts is that of evil , evil barnaba , the spy .	54.894627
his wicked deeds were carried on by anselmo colzani , who was taking the part for the first time with the company .	35.31423
he has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone .	187.4522
what was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after all , a very oily character .	132.16458
regina resnik as laura and cesare siepi as alvise also were new to the cast , but only with respect to this season	161.19516
they have both sung these parts here before .	250.96269
laura is a good role for miss resnik , and she gave it force , dramatic color and passion .	227.68623
mr . siepi was , as always , a consummate actor	86.930534
with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently .	43.48176
part of this characterization was , of course , accomplished with the vocal chords .	151.12573
unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality .	199.5245
eileen farrell in the title role , mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contributed to a vigorous performance .	154.25905
if only they and fausto cleva in the pit had got together a bit more .	302.4979
`` melodious birds sing madrigals ' ' saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could be imagined .	145.02972
stereo bgs 5031 ) is a good sample of the special , elegant art of english madrigal singing .	77.99834
it also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of italian and english madrigals plus several french `` chansons ' ' .	225.41968
the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else .	54.472324
the original impulses came to england late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo , sonatas , operas and the like .	160.70752
even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together -- choruses , catches and glees -- always flourished .	137.16943
the english never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in italy blotted out the italian madrigal .	125.96106
latter-day interest in elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in england , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries .	72.99974
as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the english madrigal .	304.9575
naturally , mr . deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen william byrd , thomas morley and thomas tomkins .	157.99396
there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture .	134.19691
both techniques give the music purity and clarity .	5.705012
claude jannequin ' s vocal description of a battle ( the french equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by jannequin and lassus .	156.19615
only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of marenzio , monteverdi and gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial .	122.1998
nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period .	132.00298
the elements of elegance and color in jannequin are strong french characteristics .	424.14688
baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tends to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract .	43.53875
in france , it remained always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full of flavor .	74.66758
couperin and rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of `` program music ' ' but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance .	153.2886
both composers turn up on new imports from france .	40.35294
bam is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is editions de la boite a musique .	294.84143
they specialize in out-of-the-way items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention .	76.16398
sonates et concerts royaux of couperin le grand occupy two disks ( ld056 and ld060 ) and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate , flexible and gemlike .	86.82796
the concerts -- nos . 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian sense .	104.72902
the sonatas , `` la francaise ' ' , `` la sultane ' ' , `` l ' astree ' ' and `` l ' imperiale ' ' , are often more elaborately worked out and , in fact , show a strong italian influence .	68.58204
couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called musique francaise du 18e siecle ( bam ld 060 ) .	22.427387
jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit , but bodin de beismortier , corrette and mondonville are hardly household words .	224.7207
what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo .	149.3885
the couperin `` la steinkerque ' ' , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shakes off corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era .	165.19904
if couperin shows the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more .	241.85353
all these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic .	60.6402
rameau ' s six concerts en sextuor , recorded by l ' orchestre de chambre pierre menet ( bam ld 046 ) , turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself .	121.359825
the strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious .	159.98064
maitres allemands des 17e et 18e siecles contains music by pachelbel , buxtehude , rosenmueller and telemann , well performed by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket ( bam ld 035 ) .	92.818756
rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in carnegie recital hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts .	116.16815
works by j . c . bach , anton craft , joseph haydn , giuseppe sammartini , comenico dragonetti and j . g . janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff , flutist , josef marx , oboist , and robert conant , pianist and harpsichordist .	58.608566
since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven to boulez .	245.13396
thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday night .	81.4103
each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome .	460.6548
the performances were variable , those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying .	708.2091
ellie mao , soprano , and frederick fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled `` east meets west ' ' in carnegie recital hall last night .	57.611866
they were accompanied by anna mi lee , pianist .	84.81154
selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages .	36.618603
songs from china and japan were reserved exclusively for miss mao , who is a native of china , and those of the british isles were sung by mr . fuller , who is english by birth .	45.399548
this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles .	144.38422
on the contrary , miss mao and mr . fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as mendelssohn , dvorak , canteloube , copland and britten .	168.84692
there was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise .	167.02971
the performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal .	82.96374
what was omitted from `` a neglected education ' ' were those essentials known as `` the facts of life ' ' .	44.06674
chabrier ' s little one-act operetta , presented yesterday afternoon at town hall , is a fragile , precious little piece , very french , not without wit and charm .	106.48001
the poor uneducated newlywed , a certain gontran de boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information .	240.12318
the humor of the situation can be imagined .	9.153937
it all takes place in the eighteenth century .	14.585237
what a silly , artificial way of life , chabrier and his librettists chuckle .	136.44275
but they wish they could bring it back .	5.9110203
chabrier ' s delightful music stands just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( handed down to chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism .	167.75189
the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish .	107.40443
the simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes .	33.358307
the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano .	145.9696
benita valente was delightful as the young wife and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring .	83.27463
the work was presented as the final event in the town hall festival of music .	44.05965
it was paired with a darius milhaud opera , `` the poor sailor ' ' , set to a libretto by jean cocteau , a kind of grand guignol by the sea , a sailor returns , unrecognized , and gets done in by his wife .	84.075165
with the exception of a few spots , milhaud ' s music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration .	63.575447
had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon .	6.6140213
sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5 , 500 other people .	106.24185
i make this observation about the lady , miss judy garland , because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote in the paper the next day	152.13951
but who cares , when the lady sings ? ?	10.6558075
certainly not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet .	106.61907
they applauded every number , not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord .	66.54576
and judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed , at times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings .	105.201706
things like `` when you ' re smiling ' ' , `` almost like being in love ' ' , `` do it again ' ' , `` born to wander ' ' , `` alone together ' ' , `` who cares ? ?	38.069515
' ' , `` puttin ' on the ritz ' ' , `` how long has this been going on ? ?	84.671364
' ' and her own personal songs like `` the man that got away ' ' , and the inevitable `` over the rainbow ' ' .	35.961124
miss garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen .	83.5468
at the start of her program there were evidences of pique .	79.62635
she had held to the letter of her contract and didn ' t come onto the stage until well after 4 p . m . , the appointed hour , although the music at newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 .	98.310745
then there was a bad delay in getting mort lindsey ' s 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs .	180.25125
along about 4 30 , just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , judy came on singing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind .	93.804565
her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing .	99.85043
in her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm . lenses and shoot at extreme range .	181.34248
there also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` do it again ' ' , and she made the tart observation that `` i never saw so much moving about in an audience ' ' .	88.829056
but it didn ' t take judy garland , showman , long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at newport and that you have to learn to live with it .	89.16044
before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music , trundling microphones about the stage , helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere .	124.447205
and time after time she really belted out her songs .	202.2171
sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way i felt about her `` come rain or come shine ' ' -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful `` beautiful weather ' ' .	147.51788
to her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise	121.77662
they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more , as though they could never get enough .	99.66844
they were rewarded with splendid , exciting , singing .	84.35522
her `` rockabye your baby ' ' was as good as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like `` the man that got away ' ' were deeply moving .	97.75186
the audience wouldn ' t let her leave until it had heard `` over the rainbow ' ' -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` get happy ' ' had to go home unhappy , about that item anyway .	127.41619
she was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers .	68.404106
all went home happy except the newport police , who feared that the throng departing at 6 35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh , and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar .	136.10666
in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies .	58.09953
this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance , but no storm .	95.28395
several times it came near breaking , and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from jerry mulligan ' s big band , which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond found count basie working in a kansas city trap .	116.62415
mulligan ' s band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations .	103.39089
but what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan ' s baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer ' s arrangement of `` django ' s castle ' ' .	43.56717
for subtle swinging rhythms , i could admire intensely mulligan ' s version of `` weep ' ' , and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 carrots for robert ' ' , a sax tribute to johnny hodges .	77.53877
there was considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messengers , who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group .	118.688126
unfortunately , blakey doesn ' t choose to work much of the time in this vein .	49.61388
he prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like .	403.86978
what we did get , however , was impressive .	1023.3435
a few drops of rain just before midnight , when sarah vaughan was in the midst of her first number , scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with sarah on the stand , most of the listeners didn ' t care whether they got wet .	96.48876
miss vaughan was back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine .	143.07431
after the spate of female vocalists we have been having , all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever .	118.72265
the evening program was opened by the jazz three , a newport group consisting of steve budieshein on bass , jack warner , drums , and don cook , piano .	119.978096
this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night when the eddie stack group , also local talent , went on first .	178.08218
putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot , when the audience is cold , restless , and in flux	234.42868
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience .	88.52398
the jazz three displayed their sound musicianship , not only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for al minns & leon james , the superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program .	104.32469
julie wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sang a set , a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as `` hard-hearted hannah , the vamp of savannah ' ' , and the delightful `` sunday ' ' .	109.85754
she frosted the cake with the always reliable `` bill bailey ' ' .	32.113827
from this taste of the 1920s , we leaped way out to stan getz ' s private brand of progressive jazz , which did lovely , subtle things for `` baubles , bangles and beads ' ' , and a couple of ballards .	186.10938
he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over .	106.80088
in this he is sticking with tradition , however far removed from it he may seem to be .	114.423706
george shearing took over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consisting of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , shearing ' s piano and a bongo drummer .	68.43879
he met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to latin american things like the mambo .	191.79056
shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport appearances .	185.49902
a very casual , pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make newport ' s afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach .	135.18031
divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted of `` the evolution of the blues ' ' , narrated by jon hendricks , who had presented it last year at the monterey , calif . , jazz festival , and an hour-long session of maynard ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big band .	74.97465
hendricks ' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him .	79.19936
tracing the blues from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the west indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches .	68.50977
to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had `` big ' ' miller , as a preacher-singer and hannah dean , gospel-singer , while oscar brown jr . , an extremely talented young man , did a slave auctioneer ' s call , a field-hands ' work song , and a beautifully sung negro lullaby , `` brown baby ' ' , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival .	81.81643
one of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones , drumming to `` old man river ' ' , which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year ' s concerts .	89.111305
demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues was michael babatunde olatunji , who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest .	128.36343
he has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year ' s afternoon concerts .	91.76132
jimmy witherspoon , blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the ike isaacs trio , which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now , helping him with the musical examples .	83.688866
pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in schubert ' s sonatas .	107.6164
music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example , played for rca by emil gilels .	218.42104
he has chosen sonata op . 53 in aj .	82.45883
the playing takes both sides of the disc .	6.66953
perhaps one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length .	220.12782
rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one ' s attention with the gilels playing .	119.83641
his technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully .	134.74297
the male chorus of the robert shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style .	56.745785
what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question .	53.526466
do you say chantey , as if the word were derived from the french word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin , which derives its name from the french-canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard ? ?	101.87274
either way , the robert shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening .	209.74397
if your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one .	32.39847
the london label offers an operatic recital by ettore bastianini , a baritone whose fame is international .	132.78831
murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` signal ' ' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` journal ' ' .	53.69234
`` signal ' ' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais .	81.14447
here , as in `` journal ' ' , mr . louis has given himself the lion ' s share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements .	51.90181
indeed , both `` journal ' ' and `` signal ' ' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics .	123.31525
but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing .	49.80519
one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development .	220.27588
it may be , of course , that mr . louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation .	161.63058
but it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time .	142.57654
one thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be .	126.9431
a brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary american mores entitled `` an american journey ' ' was given its first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night by the helen tamiris-daniel nagrin dance company .	133.51212
choreographed by mr . nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' as well as her `` women ' s song ' ' and mr . nagrin ' s `` indeterminate figure ' ' .	61.59717
eugene lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` an american journey ' ' , and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes .	79.97395
mr . nagrin has described four `` places ' ' , each with its scenery and people , added two `` diversions ' ' , and concluded with `` a toccata for the young ' ' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock ' n ' roll dancing .	121.77012
the `` places ' ' could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody ' s , and the laugh is on us all .	114.789566
but we need not mind too much , because mr . nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way .	208.76424
miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures ' ' that bother them somehow .	98.10217
unfortunately , the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so .	147.0212
nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time .	58.373898
the music here , russell smith ' s `` tetrameron ' ' , sounded good .	25.558832
all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with mr . nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers , seemed to be fine shape .	75.99478
the symphony of the air , greatly assisted by van cliburn , last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall off to a good start .	125.57999
at the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at carnegie , and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs , repeating each of them in five different communities .	179.44571
this news , announced by jerome toobin , the orchestra ' s administrative director , brought applause from the 2 , 800 persons who filled the hall .	88.470764
they showed they were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln center of the new york philharmonic , the philadelphia orchestra and the boston symphony .	119.905
this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county center in white plains .	125.764496
the details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in which they will be given , will be announced later , mr . toobin said .	65.58864
the concertos that van cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return from russia in 1958 have been the tchaikovsky , the rachmaninoff third , and the prokofieff third .	163.37006
it was pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded , `` the emperor ' ' .	141.56592
the young texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him .	196.72278
but they were not what distinguished his performance .	30.715342
the elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final rondo .	61.87117
mr . cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne .	26.121101
alfred wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he is , picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding , poetic mystery .	113.34366
the collaboration was remarkable , as it was in both the other movements , too .	134.10442
mr . wallenstein , who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle , also conducted the `` leonore ' ' overture no . 3 and the fourth symphony .	64.70438
the orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively .	978.19385
and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven .	101.375565
igor oistrakh will be the next soloist on feb . 4 .	6.4121165
there are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in .	281.2601
today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it .	84.07709
in the more casually constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit .	73.45286
yet there is the classic case of the gershwins ' `` the man i love ' ' .	30.596367
deemed too static when it was first heard in `` lady be good ' ' in philadelphia in 1924 , it was dropped from the score .	67.83606
it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of `` strike up the band ' ' and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up .	95.311584
it finally reached broadway in the second and successful version of `` strike up the band ' ' in 1929 .	83.51159
( still another song in `` strike up the band ' ' -- `` i ' ve got a crush on you ' ' -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure , `` treasure girl ' ' .	34.73568
like the gershwins , richard rodgers and lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them .	97.604546
if one of mr . rodgers ' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure , mr . hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show .	185.12076
several of these double entries have been collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney , along with rodgers and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard rodgers and hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , rodgers and hart revisited ( spruce records , 505 fifth avenue , new york ) .	68.33489
among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of `` the garrick gaieties ' ' , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from rodgers and hart in the years that followed	52.846725
dorothy loudon ' s raucous listing of the attractions `` at the roxy music hall ' ' from `` i married an angel ' '	139.3193
and the incisive style with which charlotte rae delivers the top-drawer hart lyrics of `` i blush ' ' , a song that was cut from `` a connecticut yankee ' ' .	46.837345
altogether fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists .	36.20057
norman paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment	5.185336
turning to the current musical season on broadway , the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , how to succeed in business without really trying , has been transferred to an original cast album ( r . c . a . victor loc 1066	95.35877
stereo lso 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments , although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect .	107.2579
robert morse , singing with comically plaintive earnestness , carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in frank loesser ' s score .	86.12598
rudy vallee , who shares star billing with mr . morse , makes only two appearances .	92.36986
he shares with mr . morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice .	202.30516
in general , mr . loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer .	218.66487
like mr . loesser , jerry herman is both composer and lyriist for milk and honey ( r . c . a . victor loc 1065	116.06981
stereo lso 1065 ) , but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics .	88.9832
for this story of an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel , mr . herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles .	178.01555
there are the full-bodied , resourceful voices of robert weede , mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the most of mr . herman ' s lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of molly picon .	110.445335
mr . herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms .	226.99568
not content to create only the music and lyrics , noel coward also wrote the book and directed sail away ( capitol wao 1643	140.15836
stereo swao 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr . coward ' s more memorable works .	105.61214
the melodies flow along pleasantly , as mr . coward ' s songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality .	189.16768
elaine stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr . coward ' s songs .	127.839584
with three fine russian films in recent months on world war 2 , -- `` the house i live in ' ' , `` the cranes are flying ' ' and `` ballad of a soldier ' ' -- we had every right to expect a real soviet block-buster in `` the day the war ended ' ' .	58.146812
it simply isn ' t , not by a long shot .	47.589188
the artkino presentation , with english titles , opened on saturday at the cameo theatre .	172.10573
make no mistake , this gorky studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave , carefully written , performed and directed .	181.56044
in describing the initial allied occupation of a middle-sized german city , the picture has color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments .	326.5415
told strictly from the viewpoint of the russian conquerors , the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict ' s aftermath .	96.7361
unfortunately , the whole picture hinges on this romance , at the expense of everything else .	74.099686
tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivets on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicated by nothing more than a friend they don ' t want to hurt .	100.74631
it ' s the old story , war or no war , and more than one viewer may recall hollywood ' s `` titanic ' ' , several seasons back , when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante .	101.510765
under yakov segal ' s direction , it begins stirringly , as crouching soviet and nazi troops silently scan each other , waiting for the first surrender gesture .	176.35721
one high-up camera shot is magnificent , as the germans straggle from a cathedral , dotting a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons .	111.052475
ring of bright water , by gavin maxwell .	6.2686815
only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience .	121.133194
`` ring of bright water ' ' by gavin maxwell is just that -- a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands .	59.93638
`` he has married me with a ring of bright water ' ' , begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys .	125.88534
the place is camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of skye .	214.6132
it is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags , greylag geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters .	128.49915
how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience .	166.55838
just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough .	146.95706
there is mijbil , an otter who travelled with maxwell -- and gave maxwell ' s name to a new species -- from the tigris marshes to his london flat .	83.00002
it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature .	61.381195
this is not only a compliment to mijbil , of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub ' s journey by plane from iraq to london , then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to camusfearna , with affectionate detail .	79.883095
mij , as his owner was soon to learn , had strange , inexplicable habits .	185.87453
he liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth .	466.93616
he preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow .	45.49964
given a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours .	152.53918
with curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so .	140.46927
a year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader , one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted , but self-discovery as well .	100.058525
in the solitude of camusfearna there had been no loneliness .	87.50032
`` to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating	256.02112
it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted , allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses ' ' .	118.937965
now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trusted implicitly by some creature .	176.11401
two other people in time shared mijbil ' s love `` it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water	160.94234
we were his trinity , and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation .	95.616615
in turn each of us in our own way depended , as gods do , upon his worship ' ' .	98.99887
the brief details of mijbil ' s death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy .	128.64505
man , to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty , was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man .	120.04138
but then , through a strange coincidence , maxwell manages to acquire idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story starts once more .	164.26147
one is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or maxwell himself , poet , portrait painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life , in a language at once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed .	93.11328
this reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement .	124.071556
now gavin maxwell ' s ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world .	72.44678
-- the performances of the comedie francaise are the most important recent events in the new york theater .	42.869007
they serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats , as accurately as possible , the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century .	76.089386
on the contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpreted , and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the comedie .	102.195076
of course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further reminds us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism .	66.69179
the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the broadway producers who , in two instances this season , closed their plays after one performance .	199.74449
but they are aware of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic .	289.0343
in france , novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempted .	430.83032
the government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put moliere ' s characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results .	157.38564
so far as i know , the comedie has never put moliere ' s people in the costumes of the 20th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters .	80.52348
last season , the comedie ' s two principal experiments came to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine ' s `` phedre ' ' and moliere ' s `` school for wives ' ' .	76.473526
the new `` phedre ' ' was done in 17th century setting , instead of ancient greek	172.2844
perhaps that is the comedie ' s equivalent for thrusting this play ' s characters into our own time .	173.79352
the speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance .	51.517006
a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent .	72.07179
the new `` school for wives ' ' was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character .	150.3405
among the moliere specialists of some years ago , louis jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while fernand ledoux , often performing at the comedie , made them more gross than moliere may have intended .	221.03693
apparently , jouvet and ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in `` the school for wives ' ' .	50.700245
i say `` apparently ' ' although i saw jouvet as arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death	179.93874
by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy .	85.161385
arnolphe , it will be recalled , is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be .	70.419174
one influential french critic remarked `` pity for arnolphe comes with age ' ' .	136.57246
accordingly , at the comedie last year , jean meyer played a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy .	142.88988
but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly .	726.66754
wisely , the comedie has brought moliere ' s `` tartuffe ' ' on its tour and has left `` the school for wives ' ' at home .	51.67212
tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor ' s wife .	31.783792
jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and ledoux , at the comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or so the historians tell us .	101.329025
louis seigner , who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux , is the tartuffe of the present production , which he himself directed .	164.35439
his red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality .	100.000854
but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory	361.39523
of course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation .	70.329544
occasionally , seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another .	209.27724
the whole role , by the way , is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen seigner in his other parts .	136.98126
his normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly .	138.30826
here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness .	102.87698
seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service .	124.79995
in that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the comedie .	46.61292
we are often told that the comedie has , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy , drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage .	320.64075
seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company	109.01686
among his other parts are the leads in `` the bourgeois gentleman ' ' and `` the imaginary invalid ' ' .	26.131472
in moliere ' s farce , `` the tricks of scapin ' ' , robert hirsch undertakes another of the great roles .	60.58037
to begin with , scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master .	70.81874
hirsch ' s scapin is healthy , cheerful , energetic , revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves .	79.66471
hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world .	166.4197
and surely his scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody ' s servant .	131.11888
django reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , was a true artist , one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels .	117.07464
there is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn ' t owe something to django .	145.03865
he told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records he bought in the flea market in paris .	142.70596
it was the first jazz he had heard .	35.57918
django , who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in belgium and who died in 1953 in france , was an extraordinary man .	94.62818
most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette .	107.72227
and this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz .	365.70932
you can catch up with him -- if you haven ' t already -- on rca-victor ' s album .	54.065662
`` djangology ' ' , made up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of the hot club of france .	158.20163
this is a choice item and grappely deserves mention too , of course .	68.1245
he is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin .	146.38322
they play `` minor swing ' ' , `` honeysuckle rose ' ' , `` beyond the sea ' ' , `` bricktop ' ' , `` heavy artillery ' ' , `` djangology ' ' , `` after you ' ve gone ' ' , `` where are you , my love ' ' ? ?	30.533266
`` i saw stars ' ' , `` lover man ' ' , `` menilmontant ' ' and `` swing 42 ' ' .	18.156883
all this is great proceedings -- get the minutes .	454.88068
kid ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz .	94.07786
he dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans .	132.68047
his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember .	125.0446
good time jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made .	119.016426
wellman braud , bass , and minor hall , drums .	10.328665
the set contains `` high society ' ' , `` do what ory say ' ' , `` down home rag ' ' , `` careless love ' ' , jazz me blues ' ' , `` weary blues ' ' , `` original dixieland one-step ' ' , `` bourbon street parade ' ' , `` panama ' ' , `` toot , toot , tootsie ' ' , `` oh didn ' t he ramble ' ' , `` beale street blues ' ' , `` maryland , my maryland ' ' , `` 1919 rag ' ' , `` eh , la bas ' ' , `` mood indigo ' ' , and `` bugle call rag ' ' .	29.189543
all this will serve to show off the ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems .	196.76443
mischa elman shared last night ' s lewisohn stadium concert with three american composers .	126.090256
his portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin to wit , the mendelssohn and the tchaikovsky .	184.10796
that is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man	323.80774
there were 8 , 000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard elman .	444.75632
but , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical .	100.79018
the american part of the evening consisted of paul creston ' s dance overture , william schuman ' s `` chester ' ' from `` new england triptych ' ' and two works of wallingford riegger , dance rhythms , op . 58 , and a romanza for strings , op . 56a .	64.5724
the creston is purely a potboiler , with spanish , english , french and american dances mixed into the stew .	121.39212
the riegger , with its latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale	144.1763
like his sweet , attractive romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` non-dissonant ( mostly ) ' ' category of works .	164.72197
the schuman `` chester ' ' takes off from an old william billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect .	106.19839
all these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors .	75.26045
it was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change .	101.40298
we have alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the stadium symphony .	111.07324
a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of `` a question of adultery ' ' , yesterday ' s new british import at the apollo .	74.857124
since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise , the film ' s extensive discussion of the problem seems , at best , superfluous .	63.6899
in its present artless , low-budget form , the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath .	72.20436
with julie london enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive .	269.2723
the explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident .	129.19402
anthony steel , as the husband , is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce , labeling her action adulterous .	412.84048
the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of don chaffey , as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father and anton diffring as an innocent bystander .	212.05655
after a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one ' s surprise , leaves the legal question unresolved .	109.79213
when the husband drops the case and returns to his wife , both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place .	116.53038
-- for its final change of bill in its london season , the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a `` gala program ' ' at the royal opera house , covent garden .	114.22707
no doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far , it too could give a circus if it pleased .	208.61786
and please it did , in every sense of the word , for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of london audiences .	99.83891
at the end of the program , indeed , there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it .	81.53866
alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number , `` taras bulba ' ' , but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all .	65.5041
only a plea from the house manager , john collins , finally broke up the party .	193.82088
but for all the manifest intention to `` show off ' ' , this was a circus with a difference , for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level , it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company .	104.135345
the `` taras bulba ' ' excerpt is a rousing version of gogol ' s ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by bo fenster to music of soloviev-sedoi .	100.10549
it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt to make the human body perform .	101.15957
yuri soloviev , oleg sokolov , alexei zhitkov , lev sokolov , yuri korneyev and mr . livshitz were the chief soloists , but everybody on stage was magnificent .	139.59616
at the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus ballet `` bayaderka ' ' , which opened the evening .	81.40991
and why do we in the west know so few of his ballets ? ?	210.54391
this scene is a `` white ballet ' ' in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love ' s spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful `` shadows ' ' who can all dance like nothing human -- which , of course , is altogether fitting .	108.263535
the ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty , as well as loveliness , and adagio is the general medium of the piece .	73.20362
its ballerina , olga moiseyeva , performs simple miracles of beauty , and ludmilla alexeyeva , inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments .	114.4916
sergei vikulov , as the lone male , meets the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is designed to belong to the ladies .	139.83392
the middle section of the program was made up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all of them pretty good at that .	180.05667
they consisted of a new arrangement of `` nutcracker ' ' excerpts danced stunningly by irina kolpakova and mr . sokolev , with a large ensemble	51.381058
a winning little `` snow maiden ' ' variation by the adorable galina kekisheva	328.70975
two of those poetic adagios in greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by alla osipenko and igor chernishev in one case and inna zubkovskaya and yuri kornevey in the other	51.57696
an amusing character pas de cinq called `` gossiping women ' '	41.78397
a stirring `` flames of paris ' ' pas de deux by xenia ter-stepanova and alexandre pavlovsky , and a lovely version of fokine ' s `` le cygne ' ' by olga moiseyeva , which had to be repeated .	30.599112
a year ago today , when the democrats were fretting and frolicking in los angeles and john f . kennedy was still only an able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the presidency , theodore h . white had already compiled masses of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960 .	72.49941
as the pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated , mr . white took more notes .	124.50888
he traveled alternately with mr . kennedy and with richard m . nixon .	81.1538
he asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates ' `` in-groups ' ' .	42.5055
he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in general , as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest presidential election in american history .	36.209183
those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election	111.16056
how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by mr . white in `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' .	46.371925
this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one .	210.09712
what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history .	63.663727
mr . white , who is only a competent novelist , is a brilliant reporter .	89.43794
his zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book .	151.24785
as a dramatic narrative `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' is continuously engrossing .	67.55894
and as an introduction to american politics it is highly educational .	161.44502
the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr . kennedy , his family and his entourage waiting for the returns .	75.064835
he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential hopefuls five democrats -- senator hubert h . humphrey , senator stuart symington , senator lyndon b . johnson , adlai e . stevenson and mr . kennedy -- and two republicans -- governor rockefeller and mr . nixon .	57.47632
then , in chronological order , mr . white covers the primary campaigns , the conventions and the presidential campaign itself .	119.74552
in the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television .	202.30942
mr . white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions .	228.99608
he frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse ' s mouth , from numerous insiders and from mr . kennedy himself	128.49406
but never from mr . nixon , who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust .	148.9382
`` rarely in american history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less ' ' , says mr . white .	203.04854
mr . nixon , he believes , has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign .	76.279335
although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , mr . nixon , mr . white believes , ignored his own top-level planners , wasted time and effort in the wrong regions , missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television .	97.706055
mr . nixon is `` a broody , moody man , given to long stretches of introspection	392.09464
he is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses .	88.547325
he was above all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked .	84.3586
he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them	161.08897
the least inspiring candidate since alfred m . landon ' ' .	103.743454
mr . kennedy , mr . white believes , `` had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other american could match him ' ' .	218.1273
calm , dignified , composed , `` superbly eloquent ' ' , mr . kennedy always knew everything about everybody .	82.78524
he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers .	502.58948
every decision was made quickly on sound grounds .	5.437586
efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance .	439.63596
mr . kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters .	70.57229
mr . white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a democrat himself who expects mr . kennedy to be a fine president .	52.961586
throughout `` the making of a president ' ' mr . white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down , how subordinates play key roles .	313.14517
`` the root question in american politics is always who ' s the man to see ? ?	63.166485
to understand american politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes , who are straw men , who controls , who does not .	112.69211
but to operate in american politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection ' ' .	112.4762
`` in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion ' ' .	411.44144
`` all platforms are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it ' ' .	101.485695
nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old mischa elman on tuesday night , continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of french operatic excerpts .	58.017365
miss pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments .	276.5449
the better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing .	102.69192
no orchestra , however , could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as miss pons encountered last night .	190.22464
in all fairness , there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism .	72.653755
one such moment came in the breathtaking way miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeer ' s `` shadow song ' ' .	60.55652
the years suddenly fell away at this point .	6.275896
on the whole , however , one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on .	199.72507
sharing the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion .	61.634308
mr . verreau began shakily , with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume .	383.94363
later on this problem vanished , and the `` flower song ' ' from bizet ' s `` carmen ' ' was beautifully and intelligently projected .	44.020348
radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener .	21.572226
lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible .	284.15448
the mushrooming of fm outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity .	114.36669
not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners -- an audience which , in the united states , comprises some 19 , 000 , 000 people with $20 , 000 , 000 , 000 to spend each year .	45.367466
of course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching .	345.21234
he even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials .	247.9418
but the growing number of negro-appeal radio stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects .	342.03052
it is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3 , 400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the negro .	81.56332
at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states .	145.40814
these and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers .	93.059746
for 10 years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio .	166.15225
in the past 10 years , sponsor observes , these trends have become apparent	133.39008
negro population in the u . s . has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent .	51.11451
`` the forgotten 15 million ' ' -- as sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million .	255.92116
advertisers are changing their attitudes , both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it .	72.970505
stations programing to negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels .	170.94725
futhermore , the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air .	279.05814
in the last decade the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent , and the number of negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent , according to a research man quoted by sponsor .	87.501236
a year ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business .	175.08119
the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth .	53.29225
it also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the u . s . negroes live outside the southeastern states .	77.71856
also , the state with the largest number of negroes is new york -- not in the south at all .	66.86568
in new york city , wlib boasts `` more community service programs than any other negro station ' ' and `` one of the largest negro news staffs in america ' ' .	85.93206
and wwrl ' s colorful mobile unit , cruising predominately negro neighborhoods , is a frequent reminder of that station ' s round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests .	99.55843
recently , wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit .	411.0761
a half-dozen other stations in the new york area also bid for attention of the city ' s negro population , up about 50 per cent in the past decade .	59.776115
in all big cities outside the south , and even in small towns within the south , radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners .	64.76151
the keystone broadcasting system ' s negro network includes 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more than half the total u . s . negro population .	95.074585
one question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the negro is moving into a fully integrated status .	122.626366
whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal .	113.918
advertisers have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests .	196.84308
and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , working only from a fact sheet .	133.56242
what sets negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ? ?	86.18102
sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular negro bands and singers	17.168398
`` race ' ' music , folk songs and melodies , and gospel programs .	113.86988
furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station .	246.84038
advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro concern .	663.9331
sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendon-ebony station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious of quality and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race	196.77194
he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio programs famous ' ' .	165.5142
the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of j . walter carroll of ksan , san francisco	138.41605
`` negro-appeal radio is more important to the negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires .	185.082
it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the negro , seeking to become urbanized , as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life .	80.99545
negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation ' ' .	13.150571
presentation of `` the life and times of john sloan ' ' in the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art .	116.70354
staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate sloan collection by the artist ' s widow , helen farr sloan , to the wilmington society of the fine arts , the exhibition presents a survey of sloan ' s work .	41.98107
from early family portraits , painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts , the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate .	89.64237
few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived .	108.99165
few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness .	328.5151
the paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of america in the first half of the present century .	59.326122
obviously sloan ' s early years were influenced by his close friend robert henri .	69.73603
as early as 1928 , however , the sloan style began to change .	195.60742
the dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette .	69.23817
the solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes .	243.69089
the exhibition presents all phases of sloan ' s many-sided art .	93.761986
in addition to the paintings are drawings , prints , and illustrations .	11.621061
sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of new york , thereby building for america an incomparable city survey from paintings of mcsorley ' s saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs .	120.13146
one of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is `` sun and wind on the roof ' ' , with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds .	68.27852
although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of `` gloucester harbor ' ' in 1915 ) , the human element was the compelling factor in sloan ' s art .	116.18914
significant are such canvases as `` bleeker street , saturday night ' ' , with its typically american crowd ( sloan never went abroad )	165.52902
the multifigure `` traveling carnival ' ' , in which action is vivified by lighting	292.2533
or `` carmine theater , 1912 ' ' , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although sloan was a member of the famous `` eight ' ' , and of the so-called `` ash-can school ' ' , a term he resented .	80.400406
not all the paintings , however , are of cities .	494.4648
the exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the southwest ( `` koshare in the dust ' ' , a vigorous indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ) .	79.887436
the fact that sloan was an extrovert , concerned primarily with what he saw , adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle .	110.1131
there are 151 items in the wilmington show , including one painting by each member of the `` eight ' ' , as well as work by sloan ' s friends and students .	59.087986
supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence , diaries , books from the artist ' s library , etc . .	26.979467
all belong to the collection being given to wilmington over a period of years by mrs . sloan , who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at the art students league , new york , in the 1920 ' s .	88.88482
to enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries , the delaware art center ( according to its director , bruce st . john ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all sloan works , as well as a card index file .	115.05491
the entire sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians .	141.80989
the current exhibition , which remains on view through oct . 29 , has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources .	142.7871
any musician playing beethoven here , where beethoven was born , is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care .	105.75369
in a sense , he is offering bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer ' s mature style .	262.12387
robert riefling , who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd beethoven festival , penetrated deep into the spirit of the style .	74.71566
his readings were careful without being fussy , and they were authoritative without being presumptuous .	115.61118
the 32 c minor variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another , leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline .	298.9118
the d minor sonata , op . 31 no . 2 , introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios , was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come .	150.94899
these inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of `` opera style ' ' of which beethoven was genuinely capable , but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging .	100.446075
two late sonatas , op . 110 and 111 , were played with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the op . 111 adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious .	199.28204
the two were separated from each other by the six bagatelles of op . 126 .	54.05592
herr riefling , in everything he gave his large beethoven hall audience , proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority .	100.09971
volker wangenheim , who conducted bonn ' s stadtisches orchester on the following evening , made one more conscious of the process of interpretation .	141.31583
herr wangenheim has only recently become the city ' s music director , and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium .	57.731518
but he weighted the eighth symphony , at times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music .	91.20291
he might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the choral fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the ninth	106.598526
but no amount of head-tossing could make it so .	43.86522
the conductor ' s preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring .	122.13921
the concerto ' s soloist , hans richter-haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by herr riefling .	79.07412
his was a burgomaster ' s beethoven , solid and sensible .	101.498764
everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano , chorus , and orchestra in c minor , made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs .	143.29271
the entrance of the stadtisches gesangverein ( bonn ' s civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting , however , as the young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life .	185.90848
the last program of this festival , which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories , brought the cologne rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester and rundfunkchor to bonn ' s gold-filled hall for a performance of the missa solemnis .	148.74167
a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise .	57.18365
but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science .	92.12749
it is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors .	117.2154
these keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge .	128.68008
in the autumn of 1959 , the british broadcasting corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology .	110.52742
three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator .	94.30593
the participants were professor h . bondi , professor of mathematics at king ' s college , london	80.58206
dr . w . b . bonnor , reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college , london	117.155334
dr . r . a . lyttleton , a lecturer at st . john ' s college , cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge	36.930405
and dr . g . j . whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology , london .	107.74663
the programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , `` rival theories of cosmology ' ' .	92.40779
dr . bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity .	47.94367
first of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds .	86.430664
because of this dr . bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there .	72.13499
this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years .	70.84113
dr . bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts , that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in .	134.30907
then , after many more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow down and reverse itself again .	145.70154
he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space .	182.65326
for this reason , he says , the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions .	168.58072
new galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies .	154.85114
if this is true , then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even though the universe is expanding .	149.82173
for new galaxies to be created , professor bondi declares , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years .	85.92317
he contends this idea doesn ' t conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments .	212.80157
dr . lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons .	124.36594
protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter .	135.776
the charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite , but dr . lyttleton is not so sure .	111.82085
suppose , says dr . lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ) .	171.9498
this would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess .	29.429934
now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere .	54.177162
because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere .	83.275185
dr . lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it .	135.50293
this , he claims , would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe .	30.174608
this slim book , while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe , has the appeal that informed conversation always has .	132.08255
several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field .	132.44633
it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science .	125.31016
presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth ' s atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation .	119.26339
these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth ' s gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories .	111.592384
there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us , giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions .	78.22778
in doing away with the tea tray , the elephants and the giant tortoise , science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos .	47.31753
and although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man .	111.07319
`` roots ' ' , the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th st . which has been made over from a night club , is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl .	117.26487
highly successful in england before its transfer to new york , most of `` roots ' ' is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy .	78.344734
only in its final scene , where beatie bryant ( mary doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts .	111.03104
the burden of mr . wesker ' s message is that people living close to the soil ( at least in england ) are not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine .	207.41736
rather they are genuine clods , proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought .	116.60509
they care no more for politics , says mr . wesker , than they do for a symphony .	122.48156
seeming to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life .	204.72188
they dwell , in short , in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived .	204.96304
but this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as mr . wesker dedicates to it .	138.77179
so much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace , perhaps , and wants a real big heap of contrast ) .	95.78322
the messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there is such a thing as redundancy .	51.12086
miss doyle as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile .	101.137726
she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating , including a dose of good british socialism .	142.87708
but while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her , ronnie has not been able to observe her progress , and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull , he sends beatie a letter of dismissal .	145.24129
beatie , getting no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom .	91.10112
despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why british audiences apparently were impressed by `` roots ' ' .	133.63536
there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play , including william hansen ' s impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and katherine squire ' s vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin ' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else .	92.828316
but i am afraid mr . wesker ' s meat and potatoes dish isn ' t well seasoned enough for local audiences .	65.98138
shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted wednesday night ' s `` much ado about nothing ' ' opening the season of free theatre in central park .	59.975258
the new york shakespeare festival , which is using the wollman memorial skating rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed , began bravely .	183.58415
joseph papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of `` much ado ' ' , had a vibrant , colorful production under way .	166.83961
using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with shakespeare ' s words in a spirited mixture .	33.13713
the audience filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence .	50.81459
the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick , so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult , raised chuckles .	173.58298
the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges , also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers ' heads , evoked laughter .	171.86838
the vivacity of the masquers ' party at leonato ' s palace , with the spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon , cast a spell of delight .	118.25895
as `` much ado ' ' turned serious while the insipid claudio rejected hero at the altar , a sprinkle began to fall .	271.74216
at first hardly a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened .	110.44518
but the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart .	194.82661
the grieving hero and her father , leonato , followed by the friar , left the stage .	127.49599
a voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes .	181.79929
some remained in the wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads .	121.56549
others huddled under the trees outside the fence .	8.273468
twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped .	48.378532
beatrice ( nan martin ) and benedick ( j . d . cannon ) took their places on the stage .	75.293015
in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare , like a nostradamus , had foreseen this moment .	115.55414
said benedick `` lady beatrice , have you wept all this while ' ' ? ?	73.544014
replied beatrice `` yea , and i will weep a while longer ' ' .	76.872475
the heavens refused to give up their weeping .	4.5084534
the gallant company completed act 4 , and got through part of act 5 .	381.17963
but the final scenes could not be played .	19.459078
if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out , let them take comfort .	181.56963
the parks department has done an admirable job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare .	56.65988
one could hardly blame newbold morris , the parks commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department ' s technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains .	155.1143
eldon elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and shakespeare ' s lighthearted mood .	135.97672
mr . papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace , although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable .	91.00438
elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints .	138.26288
still a demurrer or two must be entered .	19.74364
for style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her .	116.45917
if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible .	77.154724
put to the service of lieder of schubert , brahms , strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision .	142.04019
but what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism .	106.51384
instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside .	203.24112
clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic .	81.35965
there was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect .	169.17026
the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness .	226.92827
there were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication .	194.74478
miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , john wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition .	67.12351
all the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills	43.758236
miss schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .	180.87943
the dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8 , 500 of them ) had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when stadium concerts presented the first of two dance programs .	115.555016
on saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved .	94.799034
there was , additionally , a bonus for the saturday-night patrons .	95.63331
alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first new york performance of mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival .	50.904324
otherwise , the program included , as on thursday , the taras-tchaikovsky `` design for strings ' ' , the dollar-britten `` divertimento ' ' , the dollar-de banfield `` the duel ' ' and the pas de deux from `` the nutcracker ' ' .	60.25124
maria tallchief and erik bruhn , who danced the `` nutcracker ' ' pas de deux , were also seen in the petipa-minkus pas de deux from `` don quixote ' ' , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely .	47.860767
among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening , elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` the duel ' ' , a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants .	87.87081
mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , an earthy and very human modern dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening .	65.12955
as brother john sellers sang five `` blues ' ' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep shepard , mr . ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic .	71.920494
their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan .	51.52242
he wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress .	93.3806
the cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions .	129.97417
`` roots of the blues ' ' may not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact .	155.34236
`` perhaps it is better to stay at home .	9.494189
the armchair traveler preserves his illusions ' ' .	1.7371914
this somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' , a collection of travel essays by william sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .	56.50076
mr . sansom is english , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between .	334.51578
the only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell , mr . sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an american multimillionaire ( his fourth ) .	134.49973
the result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices .	227.8649
there are sixteen essays in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' .	18.34005
most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines .	119.33603
but , even if mr . sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound .	342.56927
too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another .	163.20459
mr . sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of english , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references .	121.1239
`` i like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks like , its color , its particular kind of life ' ' .	139.90862
this is an exact description of what mr . sansom does .	68.98615
he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions .	225.95691
it is an over-all impression mr . sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past .	147.21986
william sansom writes only about europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london , vienna , the french riviera and the norwegian fjords .	132.74602
but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .	92.29603
`` a writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment ' ' , he says .	34.835983
`` beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all .	154.29274
to transmit that feeling he writes ' ' .	2.5773873
this may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of mr . sansom .	51.09509
so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st . torpetius that still persists in st . tropez	279.47693
at the sun and the heat of mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an englishman than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas city	160.54652
at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world ' s finest restaurants , la bonne auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the nice airport	60.71401
mr . sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of bernini and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto .	112.57267
he can coin a neat phrase `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people ' '	57.7663
tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel ' s ears ' '	12.38658
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity ' ' .	53.725185
and , for all his lacquered , almost byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison .	64.27427
in one of his best essays mr . sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio himself that dot the environs of vicenza .	136.4147
how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence mr . sansom reminds us thus	392.62564
`` the white colonnaded , cedar-roofed southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied england to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue south , the palladian orbit stretching out from vicenza the old mind of andrea palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips ' ' .	153.48204
`` blue skies , brown studies ' ' is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs .	77.143906
in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio .	155.85266
wbai , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void .	111.55722
yesterday it offered `` poised for violence ' ' , by jean reavey .	31.523098
wbai is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue to demonstrate .	146.15752
unfortunately , `` poised for violence ' ' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point .	140.6784
mrs . reavey ' s work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-broadway production in the fall -- and , in addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged .	152.93633
the play ' s device is to explore society ' s obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist ' s models who remain part of someone else ' s painting rather than just be themselves .	116.899925
in a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty .	127.25965
somewhere in mrs . reavey ' s play there is both protest and aspiration of merit .	96.51701
but its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener ' s stamina begins to wilt .	125.738594
moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind ' s ills .	104.55383
but quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author ' s words .	115.921364
which in itself is an immediate reward of the wbai experiment	1202.8335
good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration .	301.46027
a weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month .	108.24371
titled `` what ' s new in music ' ' ? ?	4.303326
the enterprising program is heard saturday afternoons on radio station aj .	203.88504
the brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze .	141.12393
the show is programed and written by the station ' s assistant continuity editor , chuck briefer .	86.079414
the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings .	104.646706
last saturday ' s interesting melange included ernst toch , karlheinz stockhausen , richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space ' ' opera by the swedish composer , karl-birger blomdahl .	71.10705
other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country .	163.33725
it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene .	128.42766
but one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions .	202.31067
the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long american tour to a close .	60.440666
it is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody ' s heart .	161.9787
it is good to see those numbers again .	10.172054
the `` suite of old russian dances ' ' that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical moiseyev vigor and warmth	109.22755
the amusing `` yurochka ' ' , in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance	312.26096
the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) `` polyanka ' ' or `` the meadow ' '	23.760614
the three moldavian dances entitled `` zhok ' '	1.0676093
the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` bul ' ba ' '	34.983578
and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` city quadrille ' ' are all just as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back .	112.277985
so , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the `` kalmuk dance ' ' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called `` the platter ' ' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` summer ' ' , `` the three shepherds ' ' of azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant `` rock ' n ' roll ' ' .	85.955055
as autumn starts its annual sweep , few americans and canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world ' s finest fall coloring .	161.64938
spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth .	43.61733
the only other regions so blessed are the british isles , western europe , eastern china , southern chile and parts of japan , new zealand and tasmania .	53.708088
their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame up in north america .	132.15085
jack frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle	199.60178

farther south in new york there is a heavy haze of color over the catskills in mid-october , notably along routes 23 and 23a .	132.11368
about the same time the alleghenies and poconos in pennsylvania are magnificent -- renovo holds its annual flaming foliage festival on oct . 14 , 15 .	114.019516
new jersey ' s color varies from staccato to pastel all the way from the delaware water gap to cape may .	79.09566

michigan , wisconsin and minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of september well into october , especially in their northern sections , e . g . , wisconsin ' s vilas county whose colorama celebration is sept . 29-oct . 8 .	102.96739
in wisconsin , take route 55 north of shawano or routes 78 and 60 from portage to prairie du chien .	87.888626
in michigan , there is fine color on route 27 up to the mackinac straits , while the views around marquette and iron mountain in the upper peninsula are spectacular .	128.49376
in minnesota , arrowhead county and route 53 north to international falls are outstanding .	179.61127
farther south , there are attractive patches all the way to the ozarks , with some seasonal peaks as late as early november .	99.933655
illinois ' shawnee national forest , missouri ' s iron county and the maples of hiawatha , kan . should be at their best in mid-october .	125.262245

though the subject -- segregation in her native south -- has been thoroughly worked , miss mccullers uses her poet ' s instinct and storyteller ' s skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern american writing .	95.74071

of the nation ' s eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat -- at least in that broad balmy region that lies below america ' s belt line .	194.26953
waterways are busy right now from the virginia capes to the texas coast .	210.3358

a year ago it was bruited that the primary character in erich maria remarque ' s new novel was based on the marquis alfonso de portago , the spanish nobleman who died driving in the mille miglia automobile race of 1957 .	79.41402
if this was in fact mr . remarque ' s intention he has achieved a notable failure .	58.189556
clerfayt of `` heaven has no favorites ' ' resembles portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas portago was a good one .	110.23934
he is a dull , unformed , and aimless person	686.4316
the twelfth marquis de portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate .	47.95517
one looked forward to mr . remarque ' s ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised .	207.51817
unhappily , `` heaven has no favorites ' ' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list .	108.71521
mr . remarque ' s conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble .	304.54233
he proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery .	362.00735
his heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay .	131.56743
her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen .	158.91174
between the first meeting of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement , mr . remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of europe , and a modicum of automobile racing .	207.41776
the ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of it all are distressing	199.74896
the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming	173.4923
the automobile racing bears little relation to reality .	4.0536947
this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer .	140.4015
hazards to life and limb on the golf course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant .	108.1296
race-drivers , on the other hand , are quite often killed on the circuit , and since it was obviously mr . remarque ' s intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes .	129.96191
the jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature .	129.95384
perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal .	18.226366
the book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing .	86.8042
the necessity is not clear to me , and , in any case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car , which , or whom , he calls `` giuseppe ' ' , parked `` on the place vendome sneering at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces parked around him ' ' is not a liberty	89.52904
but it is in the matter of preoccupation with death , which is the primary concern of the book , that remarque ' s failure is plainest .	59.372707
clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive .	21.771498
to be human , he believes , is to seek one ' s own destruction the freudian `` death-wish ' ' cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers .	301.7512
in point of fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live .	224.98402
a clerfayt may moon on about the face of death in the cockpit	61.4944
a portago could say , as he did say to me , `` if i die tomorrow , still i have had twenty-eight wonderful years	221.78452
i ' ll live to be 105 ' ' .	1.6141909
clerfayt , transported , may think of the engine driving his car as `` a mystical beast under the hood ' ' .	64.0443
the italian master piero taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car ' s adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae .	150.32889
clerfayt , driving , sees himself `` a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell ' '	45.70149
the briton stirling moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of all time , believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet .	282.51874
errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr . remarque hoped to tell us .	124.359886
however , my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists .	103.80026
the west is leaderless , according to this book .	165.35477
in contrast , the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev , tito , and mao .	30.22135
against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all .	126.61025
it is field marshal montgomery ' s belief that in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity	133.94087
about 30 per cent call themselves christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable , and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and believers in democracy .	100.7028
but these western countries do care about themselves .	4.147265
if , say , the russians intended to stop tom jones ' going to the pub , then tom jones would fight the commies .	361.99612
but he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as `` cause ' ' .	109.262856
for all practical purposes , the west stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership .	79.24821
with this barrage , montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the west .	18.629753
never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly america .	355.3337
at war ' s end leadership in western europe passed from britain because the labour government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state .	151.45615
with britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united states .	70.46183
`` america gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike ' ' .	58.22314
she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace .	104.733765
america has divided more than she has united the west .	61.001793
the reasons are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strives to be liked .	88.05763
however , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed .	347.21133
but the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling american leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor .	284.91672
`` they are determined ' ' , montgomery writes , `` not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the western alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible ' ' .	108.532684
the net result is that under american leadership the general world situation has become bad .	226.66072
to `` monty ' ' , the american people , who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight , `` now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war ' ' .	82.675095
as faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states must be relied upon to lead .	26.961758
montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the west ' s own house in order .	84.80401
such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence .	75.5508
this leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the united states , namely that russia will agree to a reunited germany , that the east german government does not exist , that events in japan in june 1960 were communist-inspired , that the true government of china is in formosa , that mao was the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 , and that either china or russia wants or expects war .	123.86354
such a leader must strengthen nato politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked .	213.97241
after drastically overhauling nato , western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the east and west .	165.50694
major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970 .	215.96634
but the east would have to show sincerity in carrying it out ' ' .	81.226074
`` but where is the leader who will handle all these things for us ' ' ? ?	43.7105
montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy .	65.538376
the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle .	405.31302
he alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision .	71.53851
but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring france ' s lost soul .	32.398693
whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership .	79.00447
the leader montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to changing situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper .	196.5733
all in all , montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him .	80.376335
in looking as far back as moses , thence to cromwell , napoleon , lincoln , churchill , and nehru , montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men .	63.211952
he believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by churchill , who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for hitler ' s war .	103.50301
however , montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice .	46.090878
most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said , and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene .	118.90145
like eisenhower , he holds the militarist ' s suspicion of politicians .	23.92953
however , at the same time montgomery selects as his hero de gaulle , who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions .	66.51042
`` monty ' ' shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support .	108.729355
for the most part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts .	143.97797
nevertheless , montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world .	19.27109
it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership .	119.19084
and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events .	252.96165
it is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer `` live ' ' for the first time only after he has died .	89.78873
but then , mario lanza was no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital ' ' only when he has ceased to be a living voice .	75.54731
it is a kind of justice , too , that it should originate in london ' s royal albert hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( rca victor lm 2454 , $4 . 98 ) .	80.91485
to be sure , lanza made numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to new york where the carping critic might lurk .	100.84402
the reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in u . s . life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public .	171.04877
the department of agriculture averaged out u . s . food consumption last year at 1 , 488 lbs . per person , which , allowing for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry every night , means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs . or more a day .	162.93765
that mother hen of the weight-height tables , the metropolitan life insurance co . , clucks that 48 million americans are overweight .	144.32138
through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough .	431.12686
for the first time in history , the u . s . has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the government ' s most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce .	119.18607
in this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume .	201.14818
refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage .	119.40177
and in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american interest in how what people eat affects their health .	198.58606
to eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine .	148.01033
not all the concern for health is well directed .	125.59119
from the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the u . s . has progressed to curds , concentrates and capsules .	52.191593
each year , reports the american medical association , ten million americans spend $900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements .	67.4156
at juice bars in los angeles ' 35 `` health ' ' stores , a new sensation is a pink , high-protein cocktail , concocted of dried eggs , powdered milk and cherry-flavored no-cal , which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz . glass .	114.76729
grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all .	197.86336
but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of u . s . scientists wants to supply them .	92.37457
the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university of minnesota ' s physiologist ancel keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime k ( for keys ) ration and author of last year ' s bestselling eat well and stay well .	117.35628
from his birch-paneled office in the laboratory of physiological hygiene , under the university ' s football stadium in minneapolis ( `` we get a rumble on every touchdown ' ' ) , blocky , grey-haired dr . keys directs an ambitious , $200 , 000-a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing .	165.8264
pursuing it , he has logged 500 , 000 miles , suffered indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10 , 000 individuals , from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini .	53.05794
he has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of finnish woodcutters , analyzed the `` mealie-meal ' ' eaten by capetown coloreds , and experimented on minneapolis businessmen .	80.85672
keys ' s findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many an eating cliche .	241.62735
vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on ( though mothers ' milk is still the ticket ) .	161.21608
readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack .	111.19751
already many an american knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) .	185.03885
out of cholesterol come keys ' s main messages so far	287.28516
the typical u . s . daily menu , says dr . keys , contains 3 , 000 calories , should contain 2 , 300 .	69.8766
and extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart attack .	50.675785
with meat , milk , butter and ice cream , the calorie-heavy u . s . diet is 40% fat , and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind , says dr . keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease .	96.80315
throughout much of the world , food is still so scarce that half of the earth ' s population has trouble getting the 1 , 600 calories a day necessary to sustain life .	202.44305
the deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant .	56.830273
in west africa , for example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or `` red johnny ' ' , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease .	135.89156
in the well-fed u . s . , deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years .	53.946217
today , as harrison ' s principles of internal medicine , a standard internist ' s text , puts it , `` the most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity ' ' .	104.49611
puritan new england regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin .	28.236643
says keys `` maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think ' ' .	99.846344
morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him .	75.580414
the simple mechanical strain of overweight , says new york ' s dr . norman jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built ' ' .	149.9639
the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums .	235.78517
he has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25% higher death rate from cancer .	285.9499
he may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement .	128.5537
physiologically , people overeat because what dr . jolliffe calls the `` appestat ' ' is set too high .	88.49524
the appestat , which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant , is located , says jolliffe , in the hypothalamus -- near the body ' s temperature , sleep and water-balance controls .	117.88342
in moderate doses , alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail )	154.01555
but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz . -- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry .	53.75967
in rare cases , diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroying nearly all sense of satiety .	140.83829
far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .	28.099466
it may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother ' s nagging .	107.13072
some families place undue emphasis on food conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .	177.6073
the result says jolliffe `` the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life ' ' .	39.656998
food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .	114.27184
reports dr . keys `` a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .	111.198044
he may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .	155.0422
so she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .	41.861214
it ' s a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she ' s being deprived of something else ' ' .	58.742783
for the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won .	194.96991
physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( benzedrine , dexedrine ) as dangerous `` crutches for a weak will ' ' .	72.915054
keys has no such objections to metrecal , quaker oats ' s quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters .	218.44498
`` metrecal is a pretty complete food ' ' , he says .	14.433981
`` it contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals .	14.003046
in the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose weight on it -- 20 , 30 or 40 lbs . ' ' .	94.75881
but keys worries that the metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food .	148.69543
despite his personal distaste for obesity ( `` disgusting ' ' ) , dr . keys has only an incidental interest in how much americans eat .	50.6938
what concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation ' s no . 1 killer coronary artery disease , which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500 , 000 americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents .	87.12956
cholesterol , the cornerstone of dr . keys ' s theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol .	73.734436
scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells , since it accounts for about 2% of the brain ' s total solid weight .	120.84682
they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .	100.59875
they suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system .	76.235634
but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver .	109.88546
although the fatty protein molecules , carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol , are water soluble , cholesterol itself is insoluble , and cannot be destroyed by the body .	139.17099
`` a remarkable substance ' ' , says dr . keys , `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries ' ' .	28.646303
when thus deposited , keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks .	124.73957
explains keys as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery .	76.505905
the proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind .	127.376884
as cholesterol piles up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation .	33.493538
eventually , says keys , one of two things happens .	74.00862
a clot forms at the site , seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack .	90.33666
or ( more commonly , thinks keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery ' s flow to the point that an infarct occurs the heart muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured .	169.61038
ordinarily , the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body ' s needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile .	92.038574
even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says dr . keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood .	49.850677
during world war 2 , , doctors in the netherlands and scandinavia noted a curious fact despite the stresses of nazi occupation , the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping .	256.96054
not until long after the war -- 1950 , in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason .	92.13865
that year , sweden ' s haqvin malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods .	98.827095
that same year the university of california ' s dr . laurance kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise .	164.34209
here keys and others , such as dr . a . e . ahrens of the rockefeller institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each .	94.65837
all natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated .	40.435677
the degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule .	22.656729
mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens .	104.81275
the three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz . ) , but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol .	89.05643
as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .	57.4835
just what is meant by `` spirit ' ' and by `` matter ' ' ? ?	23.826122
the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all .	125.75203
yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do .	85.30229
for in the modern world neither `` spirit ' ' nor `` matter ' ' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience .	101.363045
we are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .	100.70621
when the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .	147.34412
one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit .	63.87418
just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .	92.31099
not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .	130.32202
demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .	145.63625
in such a world the words `` matter ' ' and `` spirit ' ' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .	66.54144
in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .	133.60332
the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it .	162.84326
in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit .	169.65494
the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .	262.3661
science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .	95.42954
when , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .	260.54437
in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions .	152.8782
there have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .	73.23633
all this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .	49.268795
the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .	132.97835
the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .	169.96312
although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .	307.60385
we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience .	147.70702
there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .	98.20645
science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .	49.285984
the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur miller ' s play the crucible , which deals with the salem witch trials .	136.29454
as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century .	52.03879
aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .	62.41093
the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .	112.92525
there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .	91.40506
instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .	133.85417
a teenage girl , abigail williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the reverend samuel parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .	120.743996
for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .	77.53363
as the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .	159.73793
everyone in salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it .	67.283195
it is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with abigail and parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .	197.3758
it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .	88.076195
the audience leaves the play under a spell , it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes .	111.22446
if one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit ' ' .	112.7807
this is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience .	119.33796
in the end the good man , john proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` a fire , a fire is burning ! !	61.68482
i hear the boot of lucifer , i see his filthy face ' ' ! !	77.42878
the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them .	144.33142
we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .	65.41209
yet are not we of the mid-twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing ' ' as the devil , just as bad off as they -- only in a different way ? ?	89.49067
in our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .	193.56854
we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false .	99.680565
even mr . miller himself seems uncertain on this score .	33.319042
in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point `` however , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer ' s many-faced lieutenants .	103.05457
and his belief is not to his discredit .	6.14556
better minds than hale ' s were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken ' ' .	109.406494
( page 33 ) on the other hand , a little later on he says `` since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god ' s beard and the devil ' s horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes .	127.0667
the concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .	124.49701
when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man ' s worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state ' ' .	134.27788
apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real .	360.76697
yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem .	101.307236
it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power .	57.256855
it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .	149.25934
for this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .	118.580185
the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author ' s convictions to the contrary .	43.784985
there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .	327.4148
apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence .	198.77394
think , for example , of the spirit of the marine corps .	12.669161
surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .	51.84999
we cannot , of course , assign it any substance .	210.10214
it is not material and is not a `` thing ' ' occupying space and time .	157.52641
yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .	63.06882
so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan .	102.87213
every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .	37.85685
in searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .	51.2404
for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .	265.4708
it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .	276.78378
it is the spirit which is the source of a community ' s drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers .	124.99578
yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .	43.466415
the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas .	293.95407
one characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .	802.1544
the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .	198.62167
it is for them a given which they and they alone possess .	221.11282
the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it .	144.711
it is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it .	77.5289
if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people ' ' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .	70.43281
this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .	112.188446
the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents bultmann ' s intention .	105.056526
his point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma .	56.024296
when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding of existence .	102.857315
mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols ' ' or `` ciphers ' ' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .	65.156006
the statement is often made that when bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith ' ' .	53.21327
if bultmann ' s own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .	88.81869
nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .	73.80429
on the contrary , even in the heart of `` the bible belt ' ' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man ' s picture of himself and his world .	88.18878
in fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of bultmann ' s argument is disclosed .	61.68888
although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .	75.29104
this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .	38.90643
time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist ' ' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .	114.7997
the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-protestantism ' ' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american churches .	60.78608
in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion ' ' current in the situation .	142.40503
this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peale ' s `` cult of reassurance ' ' or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .	51.73864
but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .	130.42764
however , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .	65.103676
to be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock ' ' and `` the great crowd ' ' and to take solace from paul ' s castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise ' ' in the opening chapter of first corinthians .	80.83976
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?	101.32917
can the church risk assuming that the `` folly ' ' of men is as dear to god as their `` wisdom ' ' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of god ' ' and `` the foolishness of men ' ' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?	50.541985
can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?	232.09866
there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the greeks rather than from the bible ) that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .	97.118095
by analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world ' ' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .	58.51343
but , as scripture everywhere reminds us , god does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by god ' s providence , presents it .	89.24683
and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .	90.07274
until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .	187.53847
in arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved	113.58745
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .	157.74199
but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .	125.725105
this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .	133.15842
if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no , or where i do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian .	88.20923
expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .	88.96755
this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .	101.25112
modern man , as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age ' '	97.873825
and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward	79.75027
and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .	85.29961
in any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us .	62.112732
to say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .	85.91239
we have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal ' ' tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of schleiermacher , ritschl , herrmann , harnack , and troeltsch , and more recently , schweitzer and the early barth and , in part at least , bultmann .	121.00036
it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong .	101.909424
for we must number here not only the names of bushnell , clarke , and rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the chicago school ' ' and macintosh , but those of the brothers niebuhr and ( if america may claim him ! !	100.181984
finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal ' ' movement that developed at the university of chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of alfred north whitehead .	56.66372
what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .	173.78075
although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity .	83.33914
they have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to god , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .	131.06236
when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .	70.83864
however much we may have to criticize liberal theology ' s constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .	195.1177
in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which bultmann ' s attempt to formulate such a theology has led .	87.07358
for we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .	87.64037
if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right ' ' is clearly untenable .	54.03937
whereas bultmann ' s `` center ' ' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right ' ' , as represented , say , by karl barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .	87.37724
it follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left ' ' , which has been represented on the continent by fritz buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in american and english theology .	63.38883
in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .	133.71071
we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by bultmann , barth , and buri .	143.53001
to do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third ' ' possibility is a meaningless question .	116.65975
thus , if what is at issue is whether `` all s is p ' ' , it is indifferent whether `` some s is not p ' ' or `` no s is p ' ' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .	148.41118
hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted	174.48346
for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .	187.3529
therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of buri and barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of bultmann .	111.809166
it will be recalled from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the `` right ' ' , as represented by barth , rests on the following thesis the only tenable alternative to bultmann ' s position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation	68.85381
( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation	116.4097
and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that , from bultmann ' s point of view , are mythological .	178.98885
one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom .	79.7349
representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman and anglican churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the holy office in 1864 .	95.34945
now again in 1961 , in england , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as christian unity .	86.275215
the church unity octave , january 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .	142.18555
many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .	98.267815
but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the catholic side .	183.95483
for the `` tide is well on the turn ' ' , as the london catholic weekly universe has written .	183.86371
i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman .	78.420906
as an american catholic of irish ancestry , i came with certain preconceptions and expectations	184.81725
being intellectually influenced by newman and the general 19th-century literature of england , i knew only a protestant-dominated country .	115.9312
since arriving here , however , i have formed a far different religious picture of present-day england .	210.725
in representing part of this new picture , i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments	101.50433
but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england .	223.95404
since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric .	119.19766
in any case , i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen , even in devonshire and cornwall , where anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .	136.72975
nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism .	6.7547445
on my first guy fawkes day here , i found catholics as well as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .	91.21574
a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` the true story of guy fawkes ' ' , which began	83.74451
`` when you pile your `` guy ' ' on the bonfire tomorrow night , i wonder how much of the true story of guy fawkes you will remember ? ?	54.223255
in the 355 years since the first guy fawkes night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder ' ' .	53.182613
the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1 .	59.503105
in spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of newman and other tractarians of the 1840 ' s and 1850 ' s , the catholic segment of england one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800 , 000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .	82.76357
the return of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .	166.0835
in 1864 newman professedly had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers .	98.674774
now , in 1961 , the catholic population of england is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million )	53.345184
yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .	61.438297
a protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham oratory ( catholic ) church on sunday mornings .	150.2166
she found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of english people are churchgoers .	107.269615
she may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .	112.945755
from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services .	385.4787
a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university , following anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated mass before more than a hundred .	147.68047
the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .	359.7924
according to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england , the `` total of confirmed members is 9 , 748 , 000 , but only 2 , 887 , 671 are registered on the parochial church rolls ' ' , and `` over 27 million people in england are baptized into the church of england , but roughly only a tenth of them continue ' ' .	97.541084
an amazing article in the manchester guardian of last november , entitled `` fate of redundant churches ' ' , states than an archbishops ' commission `` reported last month that in the church of england alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time .	131.09612
a further 260 anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 ' ' .	23.579947
and in the last five years , the `` methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels ' ' .	205.65227
most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither anglicans nor nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics ' ' , and have done so .	130.1091
while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church .	145.68347
it should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) .	82.934906
still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that protestants are decreasing and catholics increasing .	107.99306
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .	49.512684
a century ago , newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism , and that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own ' ' .	138.12477
that day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a `` protestant country ' ' .	99.436264
one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real christians to unite .	54.292427
many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .	79.19355
the london universe devoted its centenary issue last december 8 to mapping out various aspects of catholic progress during the last one hundred years .	124.468216
with traditional nationalistic spirit , some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best .	146.5247
i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics .	146.17195
it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses at mass .	155.3742
they hope , of course , to reclaim the non-catholic population to the catholic faith , and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the `` prayer for england ' '	84.124245
`` o blessed virgin mary , mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon england , thy `` dowry ' ' , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .	153.19887
intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief shepherd , the vicar of thy son .	110.08234
' ' a hymn often to be heard in catholic churches is `` faith of our fathers ' ' , which glories in england ' s ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims `` faith of our fathers mary ' s prayers shall win our country back to thee ' ' .	68.7077
the english saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized .	101.39467
because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , english catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` un-english ' ' .	51.191845
i have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air .	82.8926
for example , a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un-english ' ' ' .	161.10265
in this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of irish catholics , priests and laity , in england , while certainly seen as good for catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholics , especially when these irishmen offer to remind their christian brethren of this good .	112.38174
one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities .	108.54955
at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .	172.88837
moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .	94.33309
now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university .	84.47787
catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students .	242.59111
further evidence that roman catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of england .	80.151665
the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches .	81.77548
on successive sundays during october , 1960 , paul ferris ( a non-catholic ) wrote articles in the observer depicting clergymen of the church of england , the church of rome and the nonconformist church .	55.92706
the catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .	126.089714
there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman .	110.72856
such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian england .	60.87124
there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on b . b . c . , where comments were equally made by an anglican parson , a free church minister and a catholic priest .	65.51103
catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen .	143.73508
a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool , dr . heenan , and the anglican archbishop of york , dr . ramsey , recently appointed archbishop of canterbury .	42.993977
the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england .	259.33725
the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .	160.10066
and it was interesting to observe that b . b . c . ' s television film on christmas eve was the bells of st . mary ' s .	39.366642
of course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr . fisher , then anglican archbishop of canterbury , to the vatican last december .	149.53802
it was the first time an english primate has done this since the 14th century .	102.61287
english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope .	361.0802
almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants	90.21363
news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit	114.262856
a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters	149.32106
the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the house of lords in the next generation ' '	94.10097
a report that 200 protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave .	73.06635
the death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .	72.02802
the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality .	103.06926
but how can one figure symbolize both ? ?	1.0493292
christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur .	83.10508
perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as irenaeus .	237.01398
to be the savior and the lord , jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own	184.33073
he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man ' s history .	113.59016
yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .	252.1561
his history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it .	116.40231
his death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus .	77.25799
each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .	94.381195
not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it	96.55628
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .	267.87296
as represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself	115.62855
the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam .	37.166134
as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ .	40.02986
`` whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? ?	40.633812
from god ' s will and wisdom , and from virgin earth .	123.223076
for ' god had not rained ' , says the scripture , before man was made , and there was no man to till the earth .	122.53683
from this earth , then , while it was still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity ' ' .	104.866196
irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .	160.37573
adam and eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .	46.191624
irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul	21.620373
therefore there is no need for him , as there is for origen , to identify existence itself with the fall .	141.75674
existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history .	113.203705
the biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words `` so god created man in his own image	142.47493
in the similitude of god he created him ' ' .	4.677069
there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement `` if the ( holy ) spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature	113.687805
and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image ( of god ) in his formation , but not receiving the similitude ( of god ) through the spirit ' ' .	93.885025
thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster	129.6557
the similitude of god , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature .	67.638
recent research on irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction .	64.97751
he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall	94.50805
for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .	165.68167
therefore irenaeus describes man ' s creation as follows	438.11453
`` so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against god his creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards god , a law was given him by god , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .	110.620636
and he laid down for him certain conditions so that , if he kept the command of god , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal	146.49265
but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken ' ' .	108.73132
these conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal	498.11816
yet he did not stop being human as a result .	11.52156
there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god ( humanity ) and the similitude of god ( immortality ) .	87.54068
man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil ' s promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality .	176.5424
he was , in the words of irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality ' ' .	66.10076
the true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .	64.40825
for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .	54.775837
and even as she , having indeed a husband , adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race	160.01527
so also did mary , having a man betrothed ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race ' ' .	104.939766
because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created as children , irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked ' ' .	179.71664
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary .	58.60256
that parallelism affects his picture of man ' s disobedience too	298.1248
for as it was christ , the word of god , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .	54.090046
with this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .	142.19849
at the nadir of that circuit is death .	6.5236635
`` along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience	161.6854
wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it ' ' .	142.00706
this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a friday , as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday	73.30978
he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath .	105.50161
in any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .	175.2388
man ' s life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god , must now be conformed to the shape of death .	91.22409
nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to god , and he still rules .	119.92444
even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function .	104.74939
`` wherefore also he ( god ) drove him ( man ) out of paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because he envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because he pitied him , ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable .	118.60853
but he set a bound to his ( state of ) sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to god ' ' .	96.14889
this idea , which occurs in both tatian and cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus ' theology	129.45863
for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ .	84.54497
as man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that christ could bring many to life .	201.49425
it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is .	121.8663
it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next .	486.15695
it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality .	140.42801
this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man ' s fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the greek-speaking ones .	127.528946
they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .	181.4969
death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .	457.4648
it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time .	101.71999
these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .	115.49762
the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated .	101.57182
such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether adam ' s life was intended to be part of the process of time .	110.84478
if it was , then it must have been god ' s intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity .	100.59279
one night , so some of these theories run , adam would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve	206.2333
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .	97.48101
the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change .	127.4027
on the other hand , christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .	41.75883
it is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .	156.11612
if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator .	100.43295
this seems to have been the conclusion to which origen was forced .	90.96738
if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i . e . , created , existence .	149.89069
such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation	122.01335
for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .	905.8559
because christianity teaches not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ .	64.66043
furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .	227.38625
the unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the back bay -- and parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .	147.1786
ezra stiles gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .	148.83107
even so , gannett judiciously argued , the association could legitimately decide that parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness ' ' .	112.26562
we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .	199.71562
one can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture to the first church , and so to suppress it , rather than let parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .	148.17296
finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as gannett ' s son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians .	68.72877
their demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry ' ' to the extreme of proclaiming christianity a `` natural ' ' religion .	84.55343
grant all this -- still , when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .	222.177
whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association , while it may plead that dr . n . l . frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` the difference between trinitarians and unitarians is a difference in christianity	126.60652
the difference between mr . parker and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity ' ' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the association never quite brought itself officially to expel parker .	143.6797
had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parker ' s insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi ' ' .	181.81194
happily for posterity , then , the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .	150.89597
fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol defended parker ' s sincerity , as did also gannett and chandler robbins	85.17194
whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the fellowship .	47.34745
in the hall , after adjournment , dr . frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears .	157.54332
all this near tragedy , which to us borders on comedy , enables us to tell the story over and over again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency .	158.58282
it was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of new england ( which we inherit ) did triumph .	126.70188
to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .	108.00763
yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance for its rejection of ralph waldo emerson ' s the divinity school address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .	184.2578
in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .	173.48865
suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?	202.85461
is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?	95.793495
however , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .	75.132835
emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .	135.40198
parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the fellowship to throw him out .	114.01593
hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .	168.40927
he still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .	118.77662
actually , the dispute between parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .	139.19713
it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .	112.0041
the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .	69.79628
parker , along with garrison and charles sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery .	42.30306
nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace	135.2786
their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut .	36.48405
but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .	136.63623
even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .	106.354675
it has been endlessly rephrased , but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ? ?	353.97708
and then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ? ?	61.29895
there can be no doubt , the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .	97.01331
the gentle channing , revered by all bostonians , orthodox or unitarian , wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action `` no city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .	157.41544
we stand more in awe of one another than most people .	197.21304
opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron ' ' .	43.7331
even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , channing added -- remember , this is channing , not parker ! !	120.180725
-- that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy ' ' .	145.95319
channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !	1.2072383
i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .	196.89648
but theodore parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth congregational church ' ' which bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the unitarian churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum .	102.62227
because he spoke openly with what channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- parker vindicated channing ' s further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines .	193.7923
an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license .	220.54335
by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , i am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest .	91.73118
he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .	191.08447
what otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters ' ' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' holy , holy , holy is the almighty dollar ' `` ? ?	112.57347
nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as parker snarled at them thus `` talk about the catholics voting as the bishop tells ! !	154.0011
there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome , but to the almighty dollar , a pope much nearer home .	143.03569
boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think ' ' .	83.097
and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them `` even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them ' ' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .	90.97345
it was `` duty ' ' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty .	153.6383
parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .	115.26407
`` if it gave me pleasure to say hard things ' ' , he wrote , `` i would shut up forever ' ' .	34.085716
we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` but the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , i must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire ' ' .	85.58133
because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people ' s consciences .	165.07942
our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the four gospels .	116.85768
it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven a . m . on the third of august , a . d . 32 .	106.56153
we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .	58.86944
so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode .	192.16652
we have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial andrews norton , by saying that , while he believed jesus `` like other religious teachers ' ' , worked miracles , `` i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine ' ' .	136.75095
i have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt .	80.780685
it has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this .	95.47984
i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world .	60.723736
in an amateurish , yet in a very real sense , i have followed the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields .	40.95665
at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a `` higher criticism ' ' of the bible , to refute which i felt the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology , for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure .	132.88301
doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , bible-emancipated race .	113.40713
although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book , i stood outside shivering in the cold .	61.965565
in one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreached themselves , in claiming that the gospel of john was not written in john ' s time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 a . d . .	149.75003
now , if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking through his servant , it is john ' s gospel .	122.6179
to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible .	115.52648
here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of pragmatism , or the thing that works .	103.34796
test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle .	175.34035
so , i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and then tested it to see how it worked .	170.72397
as a short , possibly not the best method , i looked up `` word ' ' in the concordance and noted that the bible claims from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god ' s personal message to man .	117.06861
the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science ' ' , and i submitted to its conditions according to christ ' s invitation and promise that , `` if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself ' ' ( john 7 17 ) .	99.603966
the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god , son of man by the virgin mary , the saviour of the world .	58.896706
i believe , therefore , that we are without exception sinners , by nature alienated from god , and that jesus christ , the son of god , came to earth , the representative head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives christ as his personal saviour is `` born again ' ' spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destined to live and grow in his likeness forever .	73.620674
nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable `` moral life ' ' , although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues .	280.4223
i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well , to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth .	105.76288
to state fully what the bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends .	104.265816
the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body .	113.70098
again , as faith reveals god my father and christ my saviour , i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer .	150.67932
i place his precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability , dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to him .	227.46432
i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world .	108.164406
our lord ' s invitation with its implied promise to all is , `` come and see ' ' .	66.14938
i stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain .	182.84306
as i ministered to his needs , i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord .	92.69473
in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said , `` peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth , give i unto you .	179.53233
let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid ' ' .	28.999063
what a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him .	85.89749
he was about to leave them , to depart from this world , and return to his father in heaven .	111.278984
before he left them he promised that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds .	166.82864
i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ .	80.761086
it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord ' s guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients .	74.90015
how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room , asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and his creatures .	122.91586
looking unto god , the prophet isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago `` thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee ' ' .	120.24527
are you longing for peace in your heart ? ?	18.048811
such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .	36.123604
as only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own .	53.204906
perhaps you do not know if you belong to him .	22.889585
you may know that you are in god ' s family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father .	89.60186
`` god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' , and `` as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	54.237144
it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace	128.32518
not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy .	128.65543
why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now , accept him as your saviour and let him fill you with peace that only he can give .	155.8905
then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say	39.858192
`` i am resting today in his wonderful peace ,	167.14029
i am kept from all danger by night and by day ,	84.92444
and his glory is flooding my soul ' ' .	2.6909559
our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer space , which have captured the imagination of the american public .	28.60414
cape canaveral ' s achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper .	78.09361
while we are filling outer space with scientific successes , for many the `` inner ' ' space of their soul is an aching void .	64.94
an average of 50 suicides are reported in america each day ! !	219.6893
one out of every three or four marriages ends in divorce ! !	338.126
over $200 , 000 , 000 is paid yearly to the 80 , 000 full-time fortune-tellers in the united states by fearful mankind who want to `` know ' ' what the future holds ! !	73.72916
delinquency , juvenile and adult , is at an all-time high ! !	286.57272
unfortunately , in our rush to beat the russians , we have forgotten these truth-packed words of jesus christ `` what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world ( that includes outer space ) , and lose his own soul ? ?	89.59746
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ' ' ? ?	27.847418
gaining outer space and losing `` inner ' ' space is bad business according to god ' s standards .	121.701385
it is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments	115.01147
but we must not forget man ' s soul .	67.76239
is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that god put his son , jesus christ , on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls ? ?	120.2767
`` for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' ( john 3	50.374043
never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link .	325.35886
your spiritual `` inner ' ' space helps determine the spirituality of america as a nation .	97.49351
we trust you are not one of the 70 , 000 , 000 americans who do not attend church , but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than worshipping the god who made our country great .	113.12406
is forgiveness of past sins , assurance of present help , and hope of future bliss in your orbit ? ?	164.81728
or are you trying the devil ' s substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within ? ?	216.35307
pleasure , fame and fortune , drowning your troubles with a drink , and `` living it up ' ' with the gang are like candy bars when you ' re hungry they may ease your hunger temporarily , but they ' ll never take the place of a satisfying , mouth-watering steak .	94.821594
no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your `` inner ' ' space .	60.002575
because your soul was made to be filled with god himself , not religious functions `` about ' ' him .	318.27844
that is why the bible commands you to `` taste and see that the lord is good blessed ( happy ) is the man that trusteth in him ' ' ( psalm 34 8 ) .	116.29274
you can receive god into your heart and life by a step of personal faith .	154.04839
accept the sinless son of god , jesus christ , as your own personal saviour .	22.158777
`` as many as received him ( jesus ) , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	56.081684
`` the lord is my light and my salvation	4.2712708
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	3.7577128
a certain teacher scheduled a `` fear party ' ' for her fourth grade pupils .	40.576405
it was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears , to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely .	58.111477
the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks `` wouldn ' t it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries ' ' ? ?	100.51085
dr . george w . crane , a medical columnist , thinks it would .	116.884315
he says `` that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously .	145.2221
each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors .	793.63214
of this number , 50% , or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever .	303.4495
yet they keep running from one physician to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles .	134.04732
one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions ' ' .	321.80225
we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days .	81.939926
people are giving their doctors a hard time .	8.278647
one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles , and he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened	80.93963
30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control	127.9964
12% of them worried about their health , although their ailments were imaginary	318.90964
10% of them worried about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves .	91.656845
only 8% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention .	372.81256
well , most of our fears may be unfounded , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fears ? ?	124.605865
what is the real cause of them ? ?	1.0629084
what is there about us that makes us so anxious ? ?	141.95467
look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries .	87.864655
we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers .	61.54509
we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling .	99.512634
we spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment .	91.62014
we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment ' s relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart .	85.58508
a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks , and after he had seen it all , he said to a friend `` you must be a very sad people ' ' .	59.30723
`` sad ' ' was not the right word , of course .	47.1738
he should have said `` jittery ' ' , for that ' s what we are .	50.41909
watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something .	130.71567
in one of his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates .	133.48099
yes , and as tension mounts in this world , fear is increasing .	109.23285
does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business ? ?	72.30035
we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons , dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate .	118.3833
i doubt that `` fear parties ' ' and `` group confessionals ' ' will help very much .	51.17581
suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ?	167.15727
isn ' t that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers ? ?	88.301216
maybe we are talking about them too much .	9.935133
the question is what are we going to do about them ? ?	30.872377
meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can .	79.59344
hitler did just that 23 years ago , building up tensions that first led to a munich and then to a world war .	141.2288
the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate .	104.58025
it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack .	323.58932
it could have the same effect on communists .	11.16702
the president of the united states has said `` we will never negotiate out of fear , and we will never fear to negotiate ' ' .	31.387896
that is a sound position , but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid .	67.20701
and that ' s another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears , to develop the poise that promotes peace .	83.36895
turning to the word of god , we find the only sure way to do that .	91.50143
in psalm 27 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip `` the lord is my light and my salvation	121.286995
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	3.2717516
well , you say , those are beautiful words all right , but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day .	94.166725
he didn ' t live in a world of perpetual peril like ours .	30.935541
he didn ' t know anything about the problems we face today .	336.0442
read the next two verses `` when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .	179.93127
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me , in this will i be confident ' ' .	220.05037
that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today , isn ' t it ? ?	52.536655
our enemy is also threatening to devour us .	2.2017803
he has already devoured huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire , reducing them to slavery , systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison .	105.62257
yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us .	450.85056
what a terrible thing , that `` wailing wall ' ' in berlin ! !	49.48564
a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family .	67.417915
another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west , but was shot and killed .	61.067974
a middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall , she threw out a few belongings and then jumped	55.45562
the entrance to a church has been walled up , so that the congregation , most of which is in the western sector , cannot worship god there anymore .	123.46304
practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city .	30.269207
people stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings , weeping , pounding it with their fists , pleading for loved ones .	179.72316
but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity .	143.24483
there is only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are taking it suicide .	129.40186
the normal rate of suicides in east berlin was one a day , but since the border was closed on august 13 it has jumped to 25 a day ! !	150.60951
these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door .	234.79059
we are all involved in them , deeply involved .	173.88751
and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world .	101.5312
he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world `` the lord is my light and my salvation	72.24824
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	3.3721483
notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith .	48.956566
first , `` the lord is my light ' ' .	3.60446
he lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark .	39.638905
the same god who called this world into being when he said `` let there be light ' ' ! !	73.46063
-- those were his very first creative words -- he began the world with light -- this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness .	121.586655
for those who put their trust in him he still says every day again `` let there be light ' ' ! !	150.28566
in fact , he came into this world himself , in the person of his son , jesus christ , who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said `` i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life ' ' .	57.49131
the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ .	96.76314
he could only see the light coming over the horizon .	14.971478
we live in the bright daylight of that great event	1387.5513
for us it is a fact in history .	63.77581
why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it gives ? ?	72.466194
this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of god `` the lord is my salvation ' ' .	34.747757
he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins .	55.31414
if god could do that , he could do anything .	17.768871
the enemies at his gate , threatening to eat up his flesh , were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul .	123.06348
and god had conquered that one by his grace ! !	212.60014
so why worry about all the others ? ?	1.0835034
the apostle paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament `` he that spared not his own son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him freely give us all things ? ?	151.73712
if god be for us , who can be against us ? ?	51.809395
who shall separate us from the love of christ ? ?	17.341516
shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ' ' ? ?	36.19041
this is the key to the conquest of fear .	103.18123
this gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with god , whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against him .	154.83482
when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ , when we know that he is our savior , that he has paid our debt with his blood , that he has met the demands of god ' s justice and thus has turned his wrath away -- when we know that , we have peace with god in our hearts	97.3632
and then , with this god on our side , we can face the whole world without fear .	124.132034
and so the psalmist gives us one more picture of god `` the lord is the strength of my life ' ' .	20.761644
the word is really `` stronghold ' ' .	2.415603
it recalls those words of another psalm `` god is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .	232.00307
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come , behold the works of the lord , what desolations he hath made in the earth .	161.64807
but , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century a . d . , when an arabic scholar , tabit ibn korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .	85.33801
thus , while it remains possible that the babylonians and/or the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .	165.3364
the `` lo shu ' ' square as an expression of centrality	50.70745
the concept of the middle kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the warring states , was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the ch ' in dynasty ( 221-207 b . c . ) .	90.96299
but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .	103.38705
among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor , shih huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 b . c . , with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking	85.00081
but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared .	102.17495
many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast ch ' in palace some ten years later	129.32303
yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 b . c . to a . d . 220 ) .	108.553795
in fact , during the first century b . c . , an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called `` wei books ' ' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination .	86.493454
however , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 .	63.5449
after all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .	69.20796
but , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the han period .	166.90637
although modern scholars have expressed surprise that `` the simple magic square of three ' ' , a mere `` mathematical puzzle ' ' , was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself .	65.50391
but , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts .	90.713455
such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram .	50.900764
the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .	82.07334
indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram .	105.31593
if one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals .	106.54813
then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45	137.446
and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed .	57.575424
furthermore , the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position	89.26509
it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 .	84.27035
in fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese .	74.16226
for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature	157.54903
and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other .	210.77907
thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .	100.64044
the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality .	74.99661
these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty .	21.816345
the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century b . c . , when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences .	129.23506
his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the lo shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter ' s efficacy .	55.274174
after this time , inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one ' s self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .	51.861225
later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally .	497.5098
all this emphasis on centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 b . c . , also may conceivably have led to the development of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .	94.99329
we find , for example , such groupings as the five ancient rulers , the five sacred mountains , the five directions ( with center ) , the five metals , five colors , five tastes , five odors , five musical notes , five bodily functions , five viscera , and many others .	133.34212
this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest	154.08261
but why did the old chinese postulate five elements , when the ancient near east -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ? ?	157.71327
and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ?	122.84648
obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives , and that may have been the workings of the lo shu .	44.113655
this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking .	301.86862
whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought .	182.30922
scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries .	197.33138
yin and yang in the `` lo shu ' ' square	14.308427
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .	61.133064
for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time .	98.11387
as such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu	183.10489
but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .	94.83371
the chinese world view during the han dynasty , when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang and five-elements school , which was traditionally founded by tsou yen .	55.486538
according to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by heaven , t ' ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a supreme sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the tao , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the order of the universe ' ' or `` the universal way ' ' .	78.08609
heaven , acting through the tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles , the yin and the yang .	65.88257
the yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the sun	56.62785
while the yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the moon .	51.227486
together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything .	92.91884
we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang , while the even numbers were yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .	215.79834
during the han dynasty , another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo shu , considering the latter as a plan of ancient china .	70.577
instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence yin )	337.68164
taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china .	208.69197
thus the middle number , 5 , represented sung-shan in honan , central china	137.3233
the 3 , t ' ai-shan in shantung , east china	82.50591
the 7 , hwa-shan in shensi , west china	152.33289
the 1 , heng-shan in hopei , north china ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring shansi )	193.66428
and the 9 , huo-shan in anhwei , which was then the south sacred mountain .	72.86077
for the rivers , the 4 represented the huai , to the ( then ) southeast	265.96024
the 2 , the san kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) southwest	140.1391
and the 6 , the ( upper ) yellow river in the northwest .	85.73417
note that by western standards this plan was `` upside down ' ' , as it put north at the bottom and south at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered	58.337887
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps .	109.220985
the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces	39.23217
and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .	77.37187
few persons who join the church are insincere .	7.881772
they earnestly desire to do the will of god .	9.956951
when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve christian stature , it is an indictment of the church .	46.91226
these fatalities are dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism ' ' , a failure to follow through .	41.382378
a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .	156.019
the work of lay visitation evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed .	157.18141
in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to christ and the church .	200.52702
the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .	191.21718
the first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the church .	57.670162
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active .	57.211033
this is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency ' ' .	57.86174
it is important that persons desiring to unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant .	95.301445
it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications .	75.75079
preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received .	608.5392
the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual , expressing his joy over the decision , assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time , and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday .	114.215576
some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors .	102.96596
it should not be postponed later than the next day .	28.36353
a helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter .	84.62999
the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference .	213.23976
if possible , he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present .	177.69455
it is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference ' ' .	4.338186
he will discuss the significance of christian commitment , the necessity of family religion and private devotions , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions .	38.328957
there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel .	124.813995
each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .	8.592222
a piece of devotional material , such as the upper room , may be left in each home .	138.67535
a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults .	65.220566
those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows .	55.732082
they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them .	147.18077
many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .	260.18805
others meet on sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights .	74.42636
some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between .	185.88022
following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week .	227.00868
this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet .	228.80594
most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday .	135.89848
in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church .	52.136562
the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life , service opportunities , the church school , missions , men ' s work , women ' s work , youth program , social activities , and finances .	101.55516
the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session .	215.0384
an `` interest finder ' ' or `` talent sheet ' ' may be filled out by each person .	90.66593
) the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments .	94.17872
the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members .	41.78295
in conducting the membership preparation-inquirers ' class , the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class .	72.48755
some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally held on sunday night or during the week .	120.06336
this gives greater opportunity for the learning process .	6.964157
use dramatization -- for example , in discussing the lord ' s supper or church symbolism .	93.34044
some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session .	84.12753
some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .	852.43695
urge them to write out their questions for the box .	22.53699
use a textbook with assigned readings each week .	29.966345
select class members for reports on various phases of the study .	14.890535
conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet .	3.7194107
ask each member to write a statement on such topics as `` what christ means to me ' ' , `` what the church means to me ' ' , `` why join the church ' ' , `` the duties of church members ' ' , etc . .	45.481106
assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized .	69.908195
invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week .	149.39107
ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service .	117.4845
there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training , including those coming by transfer of membership .	105.69598
george e . sweazey writes `` there is danger in trying to make admission to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened ' ' .	82.976875
people appreciate experiences that demand something of them .	8.766416
those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule .	60.42787
for most of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches .	115.750404
those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .	70.167946
the preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .	92.0729
it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations .	20.796427
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church .	48.469543
this should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience .	277.93668
they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages .	130.81082
every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation .	73.689445
this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation .	18.923073
it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church .	29.645061
it can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .	57.62464
the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church .	114.95877
the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .	281.90994
psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon .	107.409805
ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete `` talent sheets ' ' and pledge cards .	163.11154
some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register .	74.41061
provide a name card for each new member .	17.310474
arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together .	95.92171
invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service .	43.34818
give each new member a certificate of membership .	22.911858
introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation .	102.05959
lead the congregation in a response of welcome .	11.406119
have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service .	211.48128
take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board .	64.24222
have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests .	78.034836
chapter 6 planning for the assimilation and growth of new members	72.240456
the church is `` the family of god ' ' .	2.902313
the members of the `` family ' ' are drawn together by a common love for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom .	83.6358
every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .	76.5139
yet the most difficult problem in the church ' s program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .	72.84952
very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive .	68.49161
a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years .	54.44472
one denomination had a membership of 1 , 419 , 833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1 , 541 , 991 -- a net growth of only 122 , 158 .	96.73965
yet during the same period there were 1 , 080 , 062 additions .	57.975605
another major church body had 4 , 499 , 608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4 , 622 , 444 .	68.49726
during this time 4 , 122 , 354 new members were brought into the fellowship .	79.1127
still another denomination had 7 , 360 , 187 members twenty years ago .	114.406845
during this period 7 , 484 , 268 members were received , yet the net membership now is only 9 , 910 , 741 .	164.29407
these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .	77.22855
this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship .	146.95532
studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received .	202.17487
the local `` family of god ' ' has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .	201.71268
new members can become participating , growing members .	22.685194
but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .	52.41671
the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process .	105.424164
if the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .	73.368004
those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .	175.51031
however , it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship .	114.131516
when they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians .	151.39954
the church expects certain things of those who become members .	226.65715
the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family	724.54724
-- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible	50.223206
care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .	207.03516
the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .	141.80116
to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race .	94.90161
massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .	118.066025
the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind `` oh how we hate one another for the love of god ' ' ! !	61.66306
the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .	49.723564
institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion .	91.007286
a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms	21.81944
to escape this fate , it must rule some things out .	167.23691
for every criterion which defines what something is , at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not .	89.92716
some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether	230.79794
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .	172.37552
man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .	265.86884
having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance .	103.03207
to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools .	243.31516
both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible .	108.43723
as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him .	218.57742
yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .	135.79355
is there any way out of the predicament ? ?	6.2426248
the only way that i can see is through communication .	169.94376
interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .	79.552795
approached creatively , it is a high art .	16.583246
it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart god ' s intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary .	180.96095
in a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states .	406.8301
what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ?	54.069504
i shall touch on three areas personal , national , and theological .	424.93314
by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure .	1272.7429
some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .	77.78318
modern psychology has shown that paralleling `` the authoritarian personality ' ' is `` the bigoted personality ' ' in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally .	84.7893
fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us .	38.560635
to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .	61.131603
interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever .	84.262634
it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .	109.01483
while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .	162.43575
the specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .	76.015366
emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires .	71.126434
no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since world war 2 , , and the number is growing by the year .	67.63449
as an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and non-christians in these lands .	100.812004
colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .	132.46117
actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .	67.43984
nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries .	122.719025
the truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nations very much need .	219.76872
insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else ' s .	103.68025
all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which christian missions stand .	533.7534
africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .	158.3066
the people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , christians on the mainland of china .	41.09473
for example , in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion .	106.66117
in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7 , 000 , 000 buddhists and the lament of its 800 , 000 roman catholics .	125.458244
again , india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone .	115.48985
the progressive closing of afro-asian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo .	118.28721
i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists ' world radio program .	90.03117
he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .	120.92313
after returning to the united states and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available .	84.865746
it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval	160.86838
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .	31.36484
it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-christian sentiment .	139.4156
ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since world war 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs .	128.71599
although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and non-christians in asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions themselves .	99.69007
the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims	79.42041
neither has the establishment of the state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews .	123.16128
the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form .	99.11049
the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ' ' .	112.04913
one of our foremost jurists , david dudley field , has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history ' ' .	49.169273
the trend throughout the world ' s religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment .	72.08953
pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation .	93.83731
`` what is the point ' ' , charles adams reports the pakistanis as asking , `` in demanding an islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is ' ' ? ?	177.17287
the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular .	262.42902
and while the nation was formerly named `` the islamic republic of pakistan ' ' , it is now simply `` the republic of pakistan ' ' .	26.765108
the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor .	30.007828
the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .	62.583508
during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .	157.24785
now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise .	85.89629
and in this country gustave weigel ' s delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state .	86.96271
the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigel ' s theological argument .	178.97221
everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine .	75.080086
my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them .	209.92328
that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .	241.15451
i do not mean to imply that christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .	97.21929
leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says , `` we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it ' ' .	95.67307
newbiggin ' s qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance .	88.39268
the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests , father feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church .	123.787895
in mentioning this under `` salvation reconsidered ' ' i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .	60.444557
when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit ' ' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .	87.71366
of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .	215.46036
yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man ' s own action .	53.72876
i mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit ' ' .	79.515594
he is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general .	119.59516
he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good .	303.01645
he is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both	226.62679
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .	178.34367
this is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit ' ' an evil result means .	104.587685
it means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends .	248.89738
of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits ' ' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .	65.08238
certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives , `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative ' ' .	67.457405
naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account .	72.37844
especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .	142.43872
presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account .	105.951
there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm .	184.47089
if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil .	193.58017
nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences .	199.60196
he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .	122.51065
above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .	95.697945
he does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit ' ' in the sense explained .	135.09436
by contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done	71.88128
and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone ' s doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .	154.89848
mr . philip toynbee writes , for example , that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues .	106.60814
if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin ' ' .	76.882805
against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we `` negotiate at once with the russians and get the best terms which are available ' ' , that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness ' ' .	128.85521
he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i . e . , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by russia within a few years .	64.309586
this would be by far the better choice , when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish ' ' .	60.10507
nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified it is `` a possible result , however improbable ' '	148.43872
`` the worst , and least probable ' ' result	69.47635
`` if it didn ' t prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing ' '	105.86187
for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	19.843996
if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test ' ' `` have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are ' ' ? ?	119.33825
thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality	119.73999
it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done .	76.4101
several of the replies to mr . toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .	80.674484
`` it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation ' ' .	71.353836
`` i am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .	406.76263
but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced ' ' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?	141.51888
) `` quoting mr . kennan ' s phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	57.273838
`` if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter ' ' .	86.79567
`` if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , i think he is right .	38.189823
i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war ' ' .	15.650931
even professor arnold toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms `` compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .	105.28942
let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be ' ' .	74.50888
mr . philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four , if he believed communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil ' ' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .	69.54954
even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday ' ' .	61.023293
no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .	66.221146
but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .	101.548
on their way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .	102.10929
not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .	185.99352
toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .	177.85698
`` i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation ' ' .	95.85783
would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?	96.557014
he does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that `` if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender ' ' .	74.408264
he wants to be `` brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far , far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956 ' ' .	108.44981
this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world ' s arsenal of unlimited weapons .	94.57716
it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .	191.13022
`` it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples .	50.302513
hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop ' ' .	108.74264
this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last	347.336
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .	114.10888
the only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war	48.242218
and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .	141.5369
that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted ' ' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .	184.10321
finally , just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to accelerate this end .	106.8674
we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind ' s thrusts toward we know not what future .	191.04965
much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging ' ' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .	88.41632
for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most americans .	199.68867
few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .	216.52283
this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics	51.4406
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .	29.273754
it is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the national association of real estate boards ( nareb ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure .	61.48909
how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?	104.375946
what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?	105.619095
what ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?	167.7607
what social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?	213.4874
recently , a group of the faculty at wesleyan university ' s public affairs center sought some answers to these questions .	75.81326
several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .	114.42621
here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .	181.7991
for a number of years , wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .	103.92239
this article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .	212.80563
such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .	231.53328
within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public ' ' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .	142.41768
professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .	228.74113
but as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .	102.74506
obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor ' s role .	89.24487
judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers ' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction	145.11343
and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial ' ' , `` happy ' ' relations to other people in certain community areas .	54.82993
how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of nareb ' s code of ethics article 34 in the code , adopted in 1924 , states that `` a realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood ' ' .	112.37686
though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such `` detrimental ' ' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid .	162.995
the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms	102.846436
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .	220.78221
they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals ' ' but agitators for some kind of `` cause ' ' or `` reform ' ' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro ' ' .	44.174984
obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional ' ' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one ' s work .	86.601
these men -- for the most part educated in our `` best ' ' new england colleges , well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship ' ' .	153.42337
this narrow `` professionalism ' ' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .	79.79663
as our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship ' ' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating ' ' became evident .	95.17315
realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc . .	103.587204
from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .	195.32817
it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue	156.33766
( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes	72.4362
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro ' ' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .	93.94615
( 1 ) most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .	101.8676
the commission on race and housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced , on the whole , than any other segment of the american population ' ' .	51.65228
but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices .	74.60729
also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed .	79.631775
like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .	147.43413
realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .	224.65384
recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion .	161.79173
there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes ' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc . .	135.33548
data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .	152.72797
often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically .	136.31334
significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the university of california press ) that present the commission ' s findings .	187.51978
no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised .	143.75563
the role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration .	134.18666
relevant `` facts ' ' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` harmonious ' ' neighborhoods .	129.59142
discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one ' s democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .	111.17005
( 2 ) realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing .	97.454605
on the positive side , recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position	238.2268
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .	126.8062
realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in connecticut ' s new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey ' ' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .	76.432076
as far as they were aware , the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the bill ' s passage or lobbied in its support .	133.42976
( this has not been the case everywhere .	9.402159
in 1957 , the real estate boards of new york city actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law .	239.2087
official reasoning the bill was a `` wanton invasion of basic property rights ' ' .	108.29529
there are sins of omission as well as commission	6557.054
the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced .	88.82008
judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v . kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible .	51.052773
such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .	64.97109
in the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of `` social reformism ' ' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid .	130.06134
but as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods .	135.18887
one of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .	93.68669
but responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , american good .	263.6411
such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces scarsdale or yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive .	154.29002
that community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment .	112.259186
racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator .	94.10348
thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions .	126.91031
( 3 ) over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .	71.06769
most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as `` professional people ' ' with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions .	79.925995
but what significance attaches to `` professional ' ' , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client ' s stated needs as already noted ? ?	112.17663
our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .	40.15616
as a theologian in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who `` professed ' ' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills .	111.687836
if we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion .	84.52082
science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom .	15.13298
religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .	118.50174
how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?	69.828636
and yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision .	107.086296
we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .	178.87674
and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .	45.100945
to see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom .	150.0556
you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on hiroshima .	126.43277
it was only about the size of a baseball	642.89905
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20 , 000 tons of aj .	40.804905
that is enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state building	183.90703
and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem .	497.73236
now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .	43.260555
but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb .	96.6011
hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .	1944.4645
water is af and the h stands for hydrogen	7243.9106
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .	87.6029
i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima .	105.934074
i won ' t try the experiment , but i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .	85.680756
and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond .	161.36397
salt water is still af , the same hydrogen is there .	120.51695
and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today .	43.953186
of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture .	65.00562
for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days .	150.8797
and think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make .	165.97194
with just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .	105.70771
then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .	73.43822
it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .	92.77198
now let us see where this power comes from .	187.84769
to grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is .	108.5745
i have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .	64.82142
one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms	126.61551
and i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ?	187.10419
i calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body	298.4142
that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number .	104.7454
then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator	242.21925
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic	114.381256
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people	60.02224
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia .	42.703487
i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so i decided to take another measure -- the whole state of pennsylvania .	112.7084
imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas	150.41013
so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep .	51.26353
you can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars	66.0159
pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .	11.107106
but we still have a long way to go .	55.44806
next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- north america , south america , europe , asia , and africa , all covered with peas four feet deep	53.957764
next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep	116.17054
finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way	196.47708
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body .	127.07834
so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .	346.27155
now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .	184.87991
let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill .	142.33574
i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .	96.08111
i shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long .	101.56974
then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .	114.14817
and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .	92.866516
these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone .	98.44468
since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom .	32.616287
so you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin .	59.098583
this is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus .	147.96107
even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead .	50.931694
it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits	339.52094
it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .	11.005048
you may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space .	61.511463
and since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .	117.59205
if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper .	86.997955
someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .	500.515
at any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .	292.6577
now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture .	106.096504
for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics	45.17209
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine	63.50552
and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .	22.664936
so if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine	155.74783
and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine .	54.47969
and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom .	125.77919
and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .	227.63683
then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920 ' s .	25.007006
a suggestion from louis de broglie , a physicist in france , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves .	231.34943
and to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .	77.259796
now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it .	123.92179
these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .	67.127
and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .	70.14627
it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .	79.307785
harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there	4052.2356
and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe .	57.363186
and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music .	44.087475
the island of nantucket , part of the state of massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state .	213.90518
some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living .	66.78634
the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors	1295.152
during about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers , food , and cars	62.571514
but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime .	189.49901
this is a fine trip , too , on a good day .	50.233578
with martha ' s vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .	71.22479
to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century ? ?	21.772722
how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age ? ?	78.6288
to what extent did it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? ?	43.025978
a complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the christian faith data are unobtainable .	103.09193
even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors .	73.600845
although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .	140.58392
at times we can say that it was the major factor .	57.015247
what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation .	135.93349
as we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches .	158.92477
presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater or lesser extent .	124.97034
many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse .	160.1629
the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock , for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration	63.918938
for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was roman catholicism , and for a small minority it was eastern orthodoxy .	82.26439
upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation .	42.260986
upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was .	184.4766
yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of christianity would be impossible .	143.9851
at best only an approximation could be arrived at .	288.02927
to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .	19.011633
for instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose .	169.84645
the temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level .	92.8818
we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed .	213.05478
thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .	76.66842
if guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership .	44.332043
as church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude .	78.3499
but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know .	70.46704
what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .	89.209984
we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .	146.22995
we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards , and through leaders in the government .	75.13012
throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock .	46.221775
by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .	140.32747
in the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .	48.55635
the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock .	18.454504
thus `` america ' ' , the most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a new england baptist clergyman , samuel francis smith ( 1808-1895 ) , while a student in andover theological seminary .	42.59561
with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals .	52.050365
the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith .	39.024544
here was what was called the american dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it .	90.14453
later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine lee bates ( 1859-1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of new england congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 , `` america the beautiful ' ' , with the words `` o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness .	109.404976
america , america , god mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law .	234.1035
o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .	53.63367
america , america , god shed his grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea ' ' .	59.140556
the american dream was compounded of many strains .	42.543278
some were clearly of christian origin , among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty , christian equality , and christian fraternity the passion of the land .	100.2823
some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountain-head of the american hope .	167.40518
here , too , must be placed unitarianism and , less obviously from christian inspiration , emerson , transcendentalism , and the idealism of walt whitman .	65.3871
we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them melville , hawthorne , and henry james the elder , all of them out of a christian background .	90.34843
with such a dream arising , at least in part , from the protestant heritage of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression .	49.545143
a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .	422.15842
significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism .	49.266117
several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .	64.69602
quakers , some from new england , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .	192.87172
we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints , the seventh day adventists , christian science , the american board of commissioners for foreign missions , the american home missionary society , the american bible society , and new england theology .	84.95522
the atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills .	83.10176
the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked for the early coming of the millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man ' s ability cherished by the unitarians , emerson , and the transcendentalists .	110.77012
we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the inner mission , and the red cross .	65.26213
we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .	102.013084
a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .	192.55093
several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .	153.1779
some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .	5.1104217
still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age .	64.94155
the movement to end negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until , as a result of the civil war , emancipation was achieved .	75.973404
long before 1815 the christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly .	163.22871
for example , in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .	228.1701
in the latter year samuel hopkins , from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name , asked the continental congress to abolish slavery .	76.71746
as we have seen , methodism early took a stand against slavery .	37.59519
beginning at least as far back as 1789 various baptist bodies condemned slavery .	112.571915
after 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock .	49.766792
the nineteenth-century immigration , whether protestant or roman catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves .	117.938126
benjamin lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies .	95.87909
it was he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .	107.375694
garrison , massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer .	50.032887
chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition ' ' , he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women ' s rights , prohibition , and justice to the indians .	78.91836
incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout baptist , in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john greenleaf whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible .	118.678505
a marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals .	30.30323
finney himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign .	119.9317
theodore dwight weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .	586.4645
weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational ministers .	12.247139
as a youth he became one of finney ' s band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .	71.37847
a strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , charles stewart , another finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause .	125.150604
a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position .	116.98457
the majority then went to the infant oberlin .	41.166916
they and others employed some of finney ' s techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .	110.52963
weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as joshua r . giddings and edwin m . stanton , enlisted john quincy adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay harriet beecher stowe ' s uncle tom ' s cabin .	89.4217
he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .	123.7388
wendell phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher .	133.91132
although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remained a devout christian .	127.527916
he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition .	141.86487
the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by arthur tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother , lewis tappan ( 1788-1873 ) .	78.25961
individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits	842.6481
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities .	103.79347
their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe .	40.168854
royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .	36.628548
thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors .	240.27196
but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .	8.455682
since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living .	76.060684
the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .	109.31863
proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world	144.09445
but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom .	151.56863
this is the familiar system of `` cosmic government ' ' .	17.373405
the chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .	37.80105
he regulated the dualities of light and darkness , yang and yin , which are locked in eternal struggle .	92.16079
by swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons .	74.44265
his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions .	231.20483
in this system , no man is exempt from obligations .	124.892166
failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one ' s family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead .	215.5949
and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters .	93.975365
the family home was , in fact , a temple	444.5072
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature .	173.11002
the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .	198.83061
the common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .	196.84213
the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .	79.475006
men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .	22.535479
if the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .	37.133644
modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection .	86.56355
living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes .	152.6254
basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns .	122.590645
in china , the magical system par excellence was taoism .	263.65884
the taoists were quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the tao -- underlying all phenomena .	83.253586
it was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .	50.026485
the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation	40.278988
in other words , they were actually an organization of magicians .	44.711487
mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .	23.69625
after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china , it underwent extensive changes .	104.99363
during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader .	121.19709
mahayana had gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world .	85.49376
the self-realized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .	73.18588
the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden .	180.30032
in its monastic form , mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who catered to the chinese faith in the supernatural .	114.40902
nonmagical confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .	117.3706
confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .	140.62883
if a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him .	151.14095
but let us not be mistaken about confucian `` virtue ' '	34.209232
this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation .	55.71797
to the confucian , `` virtue ' ' simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .	199.76402
propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .	194.76437
to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man ' s fate .	176.00203
this , in brief , was the historical background out of which zen emerged .	210.58217
promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry , and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism .	111.828735
but the `` marvelous person ' ' that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality than indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls .	233.81792
proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen , probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic .	97.20107
but in the chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be .	70.32605
actually , zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism .	61.42292
the ch ' an ( zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from mahayana , but its psychology was pure early taoist .	177.07507
this is well evidenced by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity , peace , and stillness -- a union with the infinite , with the tao -- could be effected .	193.04941
in fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the `` direct thinking ' ' zennist was a feature of taoism .	119.586105
so , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .	145.61311
zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .	74.201805
one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .	184.92525
one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse .	157.02014
but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it .	193.32982
it is simply that in taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books , words , or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience .	120.47732
the truth -- the eternal truth -- is not transmittable by words .	181.74373
reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap .	112.87463
the technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind ' s grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century b . c . chinese quietism the koan is not basically a new device .	89.03018
it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man .	84.63059
in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers .	242.24316
and this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest `` wonder drug ' ' .	134.95624
early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence .	228.65051
but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .	128.38254
the anchorite strove , in fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power .	61.817974
thus , the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation .	217.26117
as the zen literature reveals , as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers .	46.830746
the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles .	39.639706
exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of china , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe .	114.8228
in support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power .	128.3086
but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity `` hwang pah ( o baku ) , one day going up mount tien tai which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light .	108.66421
they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent .	222.60297
there being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore	121.26288
but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him .	92.60779
thereupon hwang pah said `` if i knew thou art an arhat , i would have doubled you up before thou got over there ' ' ! !	188.78732
the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah , and praised him as a true mahayanist .	35.4112
a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess `` on one occasion yang shan ( kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .	120.36752
when that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation , he asked `` where art thou from ' ' ? ?	74.74947
`` early this morning ' ' , replied the other , `` i set out from india ' ' .	59.600056
`` why ' ' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late ' ' ? ?	45.9871
`` i stopped ' ' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries ' ' .	97.82876
`` thou mayst have supernatural powers ' ' , exclaimed yang shan , `` yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me ' ' .	81.06566
then the monk praised yang shan saying `` i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri , and met unexpectedly with minor shakya ' ' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india , went back through the air .	169.18138
in the popular chinese mind , ch ' an ( zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated .	94.12713
a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes .	114.50055
to the zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings ' ' who have to be appeased .	87.28709
part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings ' ' .	124.55193
modern zen presentation to the west insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and so on .	171.52821
this picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as `` o you , demons and other spiritual beings , i now offer this to you , and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith .	107.56756
pope leo 13 , on the 13th day of december 1898 , granted the following indulgences `` an indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the faithful who read the holy gospels at least a quarter of an hour .	128.78764
a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading ' ' .	56.913006
pope pius the sixth , at rome , in april , 1778 , wrote the following `` the faithful should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times ' ' .	98.29828
the american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible .	113.87955
`` we hope ' ' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures ' ' .	71.79009
they recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures ' ' .	73.80669
since the catholic church expresses such desire that the sacred scriptures be read , the following taken from the holy bible ( new catholic edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing .	104.20214
do not wonder that i said to thee , `` you must be born again ' ' .	19.21844
the new birth is necessary because god is holy .	26.50219
but as the one who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior	455.96085
for it is written , you shall be holy , because i am holy .	66.298836
1 , st . peter 15 , 16 .	9.884001
holiness without which no man will see god .	11.951957
the new birth is necessary because all have sinned .	10.312282
as it is written , there is not one just man	795.27814
all have sinned and have need of the glory of god .	26.472553
the new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .	136.89311
therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death , and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned .	126.037476
you also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .	142.43172
and if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .	66.54246
in their case , the god of this world ( satan ) has blinded their unbelieving minds , that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ , who is the image of god .	67.458206
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	35.518353
the new birth is effected through the word of god	5.1689095
for you have been reborn , not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible , through the word of god .	88.13636
of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .	80.52018
amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water ( symbol of the word of god , see ephesians 26 ) and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	64.29371
that which is born of the flesh is flesh	4.550064
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .	21.059437
if we are born of god we have faith in christ as the only saviour .	35.839367
everyone who believes that jesus is the christ is born of god .	28.973515
as many as received him were born of god .	26.229214
if we are born of god we do not practice sin as a habit .	71.1336
whoever is born of god does not commit sin ( that is , he does not practice sin .	32.825947
cf . 1 st . john 2 1 ) .	13.963066
we know that no one who is born of god commits sin .	34.726234
( the new nature , received at the time of regeneration , is divine and holy , and as the believer lives under the power of this new nature he does not practice sin .	84.557625
) if we are born of god we practice righteousness .	71.58482
if you know that he ( god ) is just ( righteous ) , know that everyone also who does what is just ( righteous ) has been born of him .	89.97246
if we are born of god we love god .	81.02326
everyone who loves is born of god , and knows god .	147.52739
if we are born of god we love the brethren .	70.44476
we know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren .	83.73281
he who does not love abides in death .	5.9400587
if we are born of god we overcome the world .	26.386303
all that is born of god overcomes the world	70.0738
and this is the victory that overcomes the world , our faith .	46.948895
if we are born of god we grow in ( not into , but in ) grace .	441.65622
but grow in grace and knowledge of our lord and savior , jesus christ .	18.899763
if we are born of god we persevere unto the end .	36.183167
i am convinced of this , that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of christ jesus .	156.8185
now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory , without blemish , in gladness , to the only god our savior , through jesus christ our lord , belong glory and majesty , dominion and authority , before all time , and now , and forever .	135.40437
the new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .	128.53064
jesus answered and said to him ( nicodemus ) `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' .	18.573336
`` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	40.32831
that which is born of the flesh is flesh	3.0570252
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .	22.966297
do not wonder that i said to thee , ' you must be born again ' ' ' .	41.621315
for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account .	232.42671
if then any man is in christ , he is a new creature ( literally , `` he is a new creation ) , the former things have passed away	113.48101
for by grace you have been saved through faith	172.91656
and that not from yourselves , for it is the gift of god	50.518673
not as the outcome of works , lest anyone may boast .	183.2215
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	55.532467
the new birth is the implantation of a new life .	149.7523
he who has the son has the life .	38.38798
he who has not the son has not the life .	112.4029
he who believes in the son ( jesus christ , the son of god ) , has everlasting life .	26.061962
the new birth is the impartation of the divine nature .	37.48459
through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises , so that through them you may become partaker of the divine nature .	149.47978
the new birth is christ living in you by faith .	253.76843
christ in you , your hope of glory .	5.633995
it is now no longer i that live , but christ lives in me .	147.35098
and the life that i now live in the flesh , i live in the faith of the son of god , who loved me and gave himself up for me .	56.418888
to have christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .	13.477235
the wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes .	209.29161
so is everyone who is born of the spirit .	33.22773
amen , amen , i say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has life everlasting , and does not come to judgment , but has passed from death to life .	139.04688
the new birth is a work of god .	28.729923
but to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of god	192.43977
to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .	144.17316
you may be very religious , a good church member , an upright , honest and sincere person	120.413216
you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful	12.2459545
you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church	79.07585
you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment .	127.11246
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .	33.37846
our blessed lord jesus christ , the sinless son of god , who could not lie , said , `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' ( st . john 3 3 ) .	21.189356
`` you must be born again ' ' ( st . john 3 7 ) .	21.15894
being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting christ as saviour , and being convicted by the holy spirit of my lost condition , i do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works , and just now receive jesus as my personal saviour and salvation as a free gift from him .	106.38475
you may do as you please with god now .	148.13417
god placed himself in men ' s hands when he sent jesus christ into the world as perfect god and perfect man in one being .	90.27564
he was then in man ' s hands .	4.806405
finally men arrested him , gave him a mock trial , flogged him , nailed him on a cross and hung him between earth and heaven	202.23581
you can do likewise though christ is not bodily present .	333.28632
you can ignore his book , the bible , and his church .	58.97078
you can laugh at his blood-bought salvation , curse his followers , and laugh at hell .	139.5817
the eternal christ may knock at your soul ' s door , calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven .	114.746666
you may refuse him , spit on him , call him a devil , curse him .	66.11063
you may take his name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .	154.52129
on the other hand , you may seek his favor , humble yourself before him and beg his mercy , implore his forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to him .	157.09338
he has said , `` behold , i stand at the door , and knock if any man hear my voice , and open the door , i will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me ' ' ( revelation 3 20	98.609535
the latch is on your side of the door .	32.821415
the choice is yours the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with god	167.0407
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of holy spirit discipline .	373.389
the choice is yours god is in your hands , now .	72.90588
god has already set the day when you will be in his hands .	35.757225
what he does with you then depends on what you do with him now .	104.47987
then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god ' ' if you have abused him in your hands .	67.04012
this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .	23.569666
when i came into being , 15 years ago , i had one primary purpose to help men and women everywhere to know god better , and through knowing him better to become happier and more effective people .	126.17229
when you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts .	160.04686
some of the people who speak through my pages are famous	727.2152
some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .	330.29916
some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of god , that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see .	86.20938
fifteen years ago , there were no guideposts at all .	29.14107
this month a million guideposts will circulate all over the world .	13.410057
experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .	5.1875944
they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following .	277.23315
to me , the explanation is very simple .	13.425537
i am not doing anything , of myself .	7.040956
it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn away from it .	207.33578
it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass .	124.74152
it is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .	174.14674
it is mankind ' s wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .	50.458557
all things are possible to god , but he chooses -- usually -- to work through people .	249.35544
sometimes such people sense that they are being used	53.90226
fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .	95.8529
neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea .	149.86288
they borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2 , 000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called guideposts .	153.99823
compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed .	1012.90814
but from the start they had two important ingredients sincerity and realism .	44.134686
the people who told the stories were sincere .	4.6414976
for example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of new york ' s down-and-outers , he didn ' t just ask questions .	87.28959
len lesourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .	72.28528
many of you are familiar , i ' m sure , with the story of my early struggles the fire in january , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers .	99.88839
the help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .	97.846535
the crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .	120.49553
that was when a remarkable woman , teresa durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage .	104.60036
`` you ' re not living up to your own principles ' ' , she told my discouraged people .	63.854782
`` you ' re so preoccupied that you ' ve let your faith grow dim .	159.52919
what do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ? ?	29.884808
visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them ' ' ! !	42.289024
and the 100 , 000 subscribers became a reality .	334.87933
and now a million january guideposts are in circulation .	151.67296
with our growth came expansion into new fields of service .	58.842587
today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .	81.42606
they say all personnel have spiritual needs which guideposts helps to meet .	132.60513
hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land .	899.15674
they say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built .	282.5697
thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the armed forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere .	101.430305
bedridden people say i am easy to hold -- and read .	162.72118
three years ago it became possible to finance a braille edition for blind readers .	77.310165
throughout these exciting years i have been fortunate for , although i have never offered great financial inducements , talent has found its way to me william boal who so ably organizes business operations	298.59625
irving granville and nelson rector who travel widely calling on business firms .	19.72992
searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not only the country , but the whole world .	278.75104
glenn kittler has been twice to africa , once spending a week with dr . albert schweitzer .	175.93246
last summer john and elizabeth sherrill were in alaska .	38.721424
twice a month the editorial staff meets in new york for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange .	86.0841
around the table sit protestant , catholic , and jew .	64.33495
each contributes something different , and something important ruth peale , her wide experience in church work	249.73657
sidney fields , years of experience as a new york columnist	357.04114
catherine marshall lesourd , the insight that has made her books world-famous and norm mullendore , the keen perception of an advertising executive .	160.29951
there are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence .	786.7568
elaine st . johns may fly in from the west coast for the editorial staff meetings .	61.926132

arthur gordon comes once a month all the way from georgia .	72.62408
we have also seen the power of faith at work among us .	205.89755
rose weiss , who handles all the prayer-requests that we receive , answering each letter personally , has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering she has had many major operations , and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches .	207.51707
recently , john sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer .	86.082664
we prayed for john , during surgery , we asked others to pray	122.642975
all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .	121.62086
perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .	92.23931
but , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it .	162.37688
that is the kind of people they are .	93.58881
perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ?	120.19609
serious , yes , but also much laughter .	4.407707
sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate .	33.605713
there are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea .	60.011818
and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .	55.278732
each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group .	45.097923
it takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help guideposts ' readers .	107.81544
for you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is guideposts .	108.20696
i need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers .	71.63782
my message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in god .	149.22354
havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men ' s eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices .	75.94544
rumors flew from lip to lip that fidel castro was on his way to havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought batista for five years .	49.671547
already the city was filled with barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the prado .	133.36342
and then castro himself did come , bearded , smiling	39.642864
yet if you looked closely you ' d see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .	83.90499
at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .	291.36972
i am sure that castro was happy , too , about that support .	287.90802
diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny .	172.79071
my grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .	112.40087
my own earliest memories are of exiles my three brothers and i were taken often to the united states `` to visit relatives ' ' while my father stayed on to fight the dictator machado .	101.075096
when it was my turn , i , too , printed the truth as i knew it about batista , and rejoiced to see his regime topple .	138.96118
none of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead .	82.59991
i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana .	16.040125
within a week , however , i began to suspect that something was wrong .	84.61938
for castro was bringing cuba not freedom , but hatred .	267.85147
he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge .	191.86024
he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras .	164.00305
on home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall .	68.66788
he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .	2.445563
new schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation any academic degree earned during batista ' s regime was invalid .	134.52962
he had promised cheaper housing arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room .	122.81486
under another law , hundreds of farms were seized .	41.36475
farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .	36.19191
of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in `` people ' s stores ' ' .	54.45882
a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist .	54.812336
in my mind , i began to review his use of hate to gain support	202.85384
his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain .	236.57565
but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace	70.03872
what should i do about it , i asked myself ? ?	68.44039
i had watched castro handling his enemies before the paredon .	4.7240243
there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting `` paredon ! !	126.64788
i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario now the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors	411.03397
the thump and whir of our new presses .	8.426151
here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if i told it to .	165.67511
then one day , early in january , 1960 , i sat down at my desk , and suddenly i was aware of the crucifix .	56.912872
it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .	66.28256
i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner .	79.00089
now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness in his eyes , saying	197.11029
but do you have any choice ' ' ? ?	6.0028133
i knew in that moment that i did not have any choice .	21.763552
from that day on i began to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in fidel castro ' s regime .	76.418846
too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don ' t want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things ' ' because `` you ' ll stunt your growth ' ' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` hey lookit mr . america	171.94815
whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) ' ' ? ?	35.26273
after all , a guy ' s gotta have a little ego ! !	72.75009
therefore it ' s a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! !	123.100975
this happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new junior mr . canada -- henri de courcy .	156.82417
far from discouraging henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .	347.23685
instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority , professor roland claude .	316.48914
and they couldn ' t have entrusted henri to better hands because `` le professeur ' ' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth .	281.3109
that ' s because the good professor teaches only weider methods at his famous montreal health studio which is located at 1821 mt . royal east in montreal .	268.82776
undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) .	254.25633
there ' s gaetan d ' amours who is our newest mr . canada	411.54327
jean-paul senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago	876.01855
jack boissoneault , who was with us last month	291.11932
charles harve , who recently won the `` most muscular man ' ' subdivision award in the mr . canada event	222.10571
yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! !	1.121714
now when henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 ' ' ' ' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .	128.56712
about that time he began reading mr . america and muscle builder and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining .	234.64687
seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of quick-wate and super-protein , those two wonder-working weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .	104.26183
well , sir they did real great ! !	1.155669
for in almost less time than it takes to tell it , henri ' s bodyweight was increasing rapidly .	96.05476
he ' s crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame .	208.84758
henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn ' t have to work them very much .	41.826538
but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .	25.601318
it was muscular but it wasn ' t symmetrical .	108.4239
`` a real ' nothing ' torso ' ' , says henri .	16.208252
it just got longer and longer ' ' .	1.5252566
that ' s when he went to professor claude .	168.75333
and at once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .	63.91857
in his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out ' ' equipment since vic tanny .	76.82348
mr . claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous weider push-pull super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set is a pressing or `` pushing ' ' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling ' ' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .	82.57991
so right away claude introduced henri to his famous `` moon ' ' bench and proceeded to teach him his first push-pull super-set consisting of the wide-grip straight-arm pullover ( the `` pull ' ' part of the push-pull super-set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar bench press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , reeves-type `` gladiator ' ' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .	100.31152
as you can see , in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! !	339.48904
now when henri has completed four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete push-pull super-sets no . 2 .	130.48587
super-set no . 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon ' ' and flat benches .	116.52593
the `` push ' ' exercise of this push-pull super-set is the bench press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .	193.03679
you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .	76.31452
the dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the aj .	15.817222
the `` pull ' ' exercise in this super-set is the one-dumbbell bent-arm pullover .	813.7538
( note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) .	163.36038
in the third push-pull super-set the `` push ' ' exercise is the widegrip pushup between bars , while the `` pull ' ' exercise is the moon bench lateral raise with bent arms .	184.87013
the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! !	168.1217
this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .	99.59984
you ' ll know when you ' ve made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ! !	144.77711
as you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip .	143.73575
he just can ' t do anything about it at all ! !	41.72379
but as you can also see , it ' s not a painful exercise at all , because henri de courcy -- the `` happy ' ' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! !	62.56417
the last exercise of roland claude ' s prescribed program for henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets .	259.44965
by this time henri ' s entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work .	353.01376
he has henri do from four to six sets of the incline bench press ( note the high incline ) .	77.472435
this gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and aj .	138.2543
this is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests	11.954379
that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock ' ' looks of the great champions .	59.0291
so with four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , four of no . 2 , four of no . 3 and four to six sets of the incline bench press , you can see that henri de courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon .	89.08637
physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .	101.29439
rarer still is a mr . america or mr . universe of true herculean build .	171.50433
the aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles .	171.8506
now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts .	148.25487
but contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor ' s chisel -- is something quite different .	140.43947
this comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .	95.29622
often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .	143.31274
because they are `` minority ' ' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten .	146.29927
only when the newest mr . america or mr . universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are .	303.37558
the exercise i shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the one leg lunge .	68.28649
why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! !	382.95187
it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders	105.418076
a criterion of muscle `` drama ' ' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike	76.910385
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .	32.44272
definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which is easily understandable .	131.29575
the one leg lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .	428.28778
but for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular squatting , leg curling , leg extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed .	174.6303
indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .	250.704
used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ! !	161.48212
really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective 1 .	231.69838
it ' s a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise .	4.6811156
it places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .	150.1931
it improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make squats more easily and more correctly performed .	128.69156
it speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each .	191.25868
you ' ll need your weider power stands for this fine exercise and here ' s the way it ' s done 1 .	107.08128
place your power stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean .	116.91799
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck )	78.60585
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .	55.849564
now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet .	179.61719
when the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the power stands .	253.36461
after you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .	76.08851
that ' s the one-leg lunge in a nutshell .	193.91774
you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety .	394.35913
you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise .	520.8329
oh , you ' ll wobble and weave quite a bit at first .	68.68893
before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you ' ll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ! !	91.03103
although i suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there ' s no reason why you shouldn ' t make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .	44.830482
squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front .	211.16547
the most beautiful bed of pansies i ' ve seen was in a south dakota yard on a sizzling day .	57.077652
pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .	289.99597
i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .	168.55074
`` i just love them ' ' , he said .	9.210857
the more i talked with him , the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming .	120.411674
of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .	113.83921
he planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist .	29.989904
these specialists , i learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers .	90.38427
their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .	36.763134
i asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .	132.8044
occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did	130.46864
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down ' ' .	48.9464
it ' s best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .	49.687843
his soil was `` nothing special ' ' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown-black .	52.000755
i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .	235.58334
it isn ' t easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .	96.517296
nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .	57.46763
they germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily .	85.9446
it doesn ' t really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours .	205.47209
i like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames .	163.66173
they ' d rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .	331.57608
if you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .	57.892868
for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .	38.11947
i dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .	237.15099
then i cover the sowing with a board .	14.703756
this keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .	108.22214
ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .	38.8804
when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board .	176.23297
a light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth .	259.3026
i like sawdust for this , or hay .	6.79244
when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it ' s time to set them out where they are to remain .	109.210464
every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .	129.19118
the moral is don ' t transplant it any oftener than you must .	399.27304
as soon as they are large enough to move , i put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom .	282.69153
i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .	220.27336
that encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .	109.04047
i doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .	45.94442
lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine .	124.07285
one year i simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and i had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience .	67.31821
in addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .	147.8132
as a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .	79.158775
three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .	46.46962
when winter comes be ready with additional mulch .	7.1726117
i like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost .	198.60036
that keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .	51.25914
don ' t miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .	73.52311
whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you ' ll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .	50.605816
if those aren ' t enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ?	233.68504
the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february during a particularly cold winter .	258.68033
i started the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .	191.35399
( an unheated greenhouse would have been better , if i had had one .	101.91885
) the plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them .	117.47212
in response to the lengthening days of february they budded , then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers .	164.33809
its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it .	406.4299
like strawberries in december , pansies are far more exciting in february than in may .	228.2775
try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can ' t take another day of it .	105.138466
the day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy ' ' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .	94.32959
try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there .	103.69558
pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season .	93.718636
as soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant .	157.00232
a second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch .	207.32797
these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .	272.13895
i like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming .	102.22768
probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed .	157.49434
nature ' s aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation .	71.95696
that done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .	287.48605
here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .	69.48218
go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .	19.103308
it is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things	343.08472
but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .	105.986725
many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .	63.26056
if the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first .	54.19596
would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ?	1.0312792
remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds .	98.59622
they stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it .	171.20242
treat them right and they ' ll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .	189.83826
give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they ' ll repay your solicitude with beauty .	61.991367
a salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .	111.550354
this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the united states .	67.38022
it has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven ' t made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should .	122.292366
you will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .	149.74887
it is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe bartlett pear , but oily .	118.40736
the avocado should have a `` give ' ' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .	79.11301
the flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange	416.63394
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like .	10.108777
it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .	76.93914
sometimes it takes several `` eatings ' ' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world .	252.40222
once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation .	371.58426
today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world .	58.24944
the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point .	29.780472
it is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior .	71.32628
the fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-f . , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state .	111.67388
this cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .	143.66093
this happens on the grocer ' s shelf or in your kitchen .	81.68643
one of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .	107.734856
there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .	199.53915
if the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed .	550.55237
and unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado .	16.009108
it is thick , much like an egg plant ' s skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .	76.870926
good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .	119.15357
avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients .	91.144
their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system .	45.96115
aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins a and c -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin e requirement .	156.01892
the b vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .	17.053516
calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts .	94.070595
none of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .	109.81831
dr . wilson c . grant , of the veterans ' administration hospital , coral gables , florida , and the university of miami school of medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .	71.40693
the study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .	179.66104
they were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood .	61.088505
then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .	48.677616
five , four , three , two , one , fire ! !	91.438446
the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .	109.96183
the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach .	164.43318
never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear .	209.29399
nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying .	95.78742
a great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets .	420.78015
it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent ' s cities and people .	85.4539
with a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim ' s people ? ?	106.733826
wouldn ' t the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?	124.84859
the will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken .	133.81403
nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days	491.79803
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .	252.36746
at this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being `` soft ' ' , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons .	75.759315
however , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent ' s cities , at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal .	87.97282
it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic .	89.274666
icbms have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways .	26.56834
they could be used to attack a nation ' s people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker ' s own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy ' s military force .	59.817093
if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles .	58.927326
we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .	227.91238
we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile .	103.66023
missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations .	421.1792
because of a missile ' s ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately .	100.804214
placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons .	145.9271
one must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .	99.76682
even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously , the icbm still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes .	82.7292
therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered .	111.523766
because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability .	118.132195
in order to destroy the enemy ' s mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles .	58.900074
until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .	80.58767
it seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other ' s citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us .	97.91048
let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm force .	179.17389
it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the b-52 or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based missiles .	90.659134
if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons .	61.58099
an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of russia -- provided that we had used some of our icbms to degrade russia ' s air defenses before our bombers got there .	165.5921
the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .	93.26761
why , then , aren ' t we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ?	142.5887
is there any other way to do the job ? ?	14.871574
survivability of our strategic forces ( polaris , mobile and hardened minuteman , hardened atlas and titan , and airborne skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force .	78.27987
war , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation .	46.928356
forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict .	125.17734
the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed .	29.317945
even mobile forces must be found and destroyed .	16.148666
but , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ?	32.322952
they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile .	12.219825
some day , many years in the future , true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets .	78.388054
but until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft .	108.71531
however , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft ' ' airfields .	186.05269
here then is our problem aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing	227.70033
but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile .	90.87568
this makes today ' s aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon .	182.4
aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .	260.37546
this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .	65.413765
but remember this -- it isn ' t the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield .	141.04796
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles .	78.24409
there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground	32.127575
put aircraft in `` bomb-proof ' ' hangars when they are on the ground .	55.01498
build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3 , 000-foot ) airfields with runways .	124.63052
if we could use all the small airfields we have in this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more .	73.559586
use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .	79.47989
using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( vtol ) long-range military aircraft .	107.21889
we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 aj .	103.32648
we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .	22.535091
large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3 , 000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today .	71.398926
there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile .	95.012955
this same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft .	125.21787
one seldom hears the analogy `` nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine ' ' .	61.36048
if , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one .	76.54682
with powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built .	27.477438
for example , a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter .	10.369023
with a 15-to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300 , 000 pounds could rise vertically .	92.02668
the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don ' t spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete .	100.54345
when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to aj .	52.765686
if our sac bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance .	236.9246
we would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy ' s force -- whether it were fixed or mobile .	119.896194
with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating .	66.35969
no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy ' s military force .	101.978455
our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance .	101.74279
in a few years we will have samos ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .	60.038635
but in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ? ?	129.6586
what targets have we successfully knocked out ? ?	1.0717863
a ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful .	84.56803
what targets still remain to be hit ? ?	1.0814453
these crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .	68.42476
samos will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark .	74.47534
even if this is some day possible , there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target .	159.20154
if the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced .	91.184906
pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably .	91.493744
it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .	55.709263
it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .	26.433697
it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the united states with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone .	121.6592
a large aircraft , such as the b-52 or b-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons .	183.9023
few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1 , 000 psi overpressure at 100 feet .	111.07812
or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in hiroshima and nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! !	134.41138
it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons .	184.24373
today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc . .	125.331436
with these keen `` eyes ' ' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas .	219.99467
if we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy ' s military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening .	94.73916
the lyric beauties of schubert ' s trout quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners .	130.93275
but for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems .	90.725655
since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic .	132.50545
moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .	115.16392
the many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .	108.71863
some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .	266.671
other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .	71.61691
in these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown ' s attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .	131.44464
recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer than ten different performances .	99.316284
the occasion for this marathon angel ' s long-awaited reissue in its `` great recordings of the century ' ' series of the schnabel-pro arte version .	108.65421
let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first .	106.33186
whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , colh 40 is a document of prime importance .	141.47017
artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .	223.51387
but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to are by schnabel pupils ( clifford curzon , frank glazer , adrian aeschbacher , and victor babin ) also sheds light on the master ' s pedagogical skills .	120.01529
certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` schnabel trill ' ' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .	85.008545
but the most impressive testimony to schnabel ' s distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student ' s approach as distinctly his own .	147.9179
schnabel ' s emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .	89.69975
yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .	138.22523
this is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .	56.139446
and although schnabel ' s pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to schubert ' s dynamic markings and phrase indications .	45.87125
the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .	208.34576
about the pro arte ' s contribution i am less happy .	105.23351
i , for one , rather regret that schnabel didn ' t collaborate with the budapest quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist ' s interpretative outlook than the style of the belgian group .	95.8753
from a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the pro arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .	96.0038
the violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .	45.23861
the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .	88.48254
there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` forellen ' ' movement , and i suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original aj .	70.21845
turning to the more modern versions , curzon ' s ( london ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .	68.530975
every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these i would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .	161.58072
some of curzon ' s playing strikes me as finicky , however .	131.05713
why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? ?	47.74247
the assisting musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .	123.181305
( special compliments to the double bass playing of johann krumpp his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance .	123.883026
the glazer-fine arts edition ( concert-disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .	82.10681
it is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .	599.39465
but having lived with the disc for some time now , i find the performance less exciting than either schnabel ' s or fleisher ' s ( whose superb performance with the budapest quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon ' s .	113.75017
aeschbacher ' s work is very much akin to schnabel ' s , but the sound on his decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it .	88.67747
the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet ( angel ) and victor babin-festival quartet ( rca victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .	90.06981
( babin has acquired some of schnabel ' s keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight .	217.33195
) badura-skoda-vienna konzerthaus ( westminster ) and demus-schubert quartet ( deutsche grammophon ) are both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .	124.32669
helmut roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists .	122.32392
telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2 . 98 ) is worthy of consideration .	174.75398
returning once again to the schnabel reissue , i am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist ' s musical penetration .	79.992256
here is truly a `` great recording of the century ' ' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .	33.814194
this recording surely belongs in everyone ' s collection .	270.22827
from the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation .	87.67557
seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones .	94.39825
although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .	112.49379
on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of parsifal under karl muck ' s baton , or sense the type of ensemble toscanini created in his years with the new york philharmonic .	119.44869
since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .	152.35295
in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer .	129.13734
other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .	175.54808
if we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing .	130.92226
records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .	136.22522
this difference is made up of many factors .	7.953704
some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .	142.97589
( music often sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat .	93.34427
) from the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original .	83.26212
any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .	132.09187
yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .	161.14221
but if you know the real thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation .	171.61894
command ' s new brahms second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .	72.110886
like the recent scheherazade from london ( high fidelity , sept . 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .	110.153694
because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph .	77.06243
the easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .	84.45954
the engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .	224.11034
the effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .	164.20587
this absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .	213.7448
a contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .	306.88303
the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .	116.3101
yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .	115.85096
command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .	8.084444
the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority	124.605095
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .	29.14651
the timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .	41.814938
all of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction .	128.43985
for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .	37.363815
steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what brahms set down on paper .	106.356094
those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .	109.620445
without losing the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect .	116.3385
the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real allegro con spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .	125.02588
in the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .	207.07632
steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .	131.46683
the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .	79.55485
too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .	74.76445
the command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .	65.9347
your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .	188.1106
it is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .	150.90445
the first substantially complete stereo giselle ( and the only one of its scope since feyer ' s four-sided lp edition of 1958 for angel ) , this set is , i ' m afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .	150.52205
the already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari ' s melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .	91.403175
and in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super-high fidelity ' ' .	131.49367
the home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .	86.38925
as with the penultimate giselle release ( wolff ' s abridgment for rca victor ) i find the cleaner , less razor-edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my sd copies .	94.921165
at the westminster kc dog show in madison square garden , new york on the second day , the finals of the junior class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class .	42.20976
the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far south as kentucky .	127.35951
this year several entries from canada were entered which made the junior class international .	364.50565
forty-six of the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present .	63.512062
it was interesting to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class .	70.43771
as has been the custom for the past several years , john cross , jr . , bench show chmn . of westminster , arranged for the juniors ' meeting before the class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them .	157.55452
over 60 juniors , parents and guests attended .	55.05324
mrs . william h . long , jr . speaks	106.725075
after the juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the finals of the junior class , mrs . william h . long , jr . was introduced as the first speaker .	36.857864
in her opening remarks mrs . long also welcomed the juniors and stated , `` there isn ' t any other show quite like westminster .	70.73255
i know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break .	396.8361
mrs . long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years .	229.93092
twenty years ago her daughter betsey long , then 13 years of age , won the grand challenge trophy , children ' s handling class ( as they were called then ) at westminster .	235.6276
no sooner had betsey come out of the ring than mrs . long walked into the working competition with ch . cadet or noranda , another home-bred product , and won ! !	183.95221
speaking from long years of experience , mrs . long advised the juniors `` when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ! !	129.54643
dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ! !	81.12494
when you and your dog step into the junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do .	81.38127
if you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! !	89.29962
he knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers ' ' .	136.09116
`` take away your attitude ' ' , said mrs . long , `` and what have you left ? ?	72.052864
either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ! !	100.11957
or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the class , or you are just doing this to please the parents .	84.91987
`` the reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce .	204.16855
aids sounds more like a pony club , or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ! !	182.80766
`` your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be	236.92697
legs to produce motion and rate of speed .	7.293769
without right attitude the other aids just do not work right ' ' .	39.475903
mrs . long wished all the juniors luck in the class and stated , `` have fun ! !	43.99205
and may you all continue to show at westminster in the years to come ' ' ! !	27.129503
the second speaker was harvey barcus , president of the dog writers ass ' n of america .	76.69036
mr . barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for juniors -- with which he is very familiar .	93.771736
last year a boy he knows and helped in journalism won the thoroughbred racing ass ' n scholarship which is worth $10 , 000 .	113.35635
he gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship .	105.75511
`` junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged ' ' ! !	86.907906
is one of mr . barcus ' strong beliefs .	236.1334
he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should take a more active part in encouraging the junior division ! !	173.5939
in closing , mr . barcus also wished all the juniors luck in their class .	52.79046
instead of 3 a . m . in the past , the juniors class at westminster was held at 4 45 p . m . .	41.884975
this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! !	79.90298
before the juniors entered the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs .	127.711876
from there on , each junior was going to be judged individually .	19.71318
this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the class .	100.63722
this year anne hone rogers , outstanding handler , judged the class .	54.42676
this is the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at westminster that a lady handler has judged the class .	61.439617
as the juniors entered the ring , mr . spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that westminster has held the finals of the junior competition .	138.62213
juniors competed last year at american kennel club and canadian kennel club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this class -- the finals for the year .	56.18031
a junior who won two or more wins in the open class was eligible .	124.15541
( the purpose of the junior showmanship competition is to teach and encourage juniors to become good sportsmen .	87.49131
many adults showing at westminster today are products of this class .	17.889738
it seemed an almost impossible job for miss rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 juniors entered .	95.68576
a large number of these juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners .	46.730824
after the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring .	59.978207
she then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship .	181.30316
betty lou ham , age 16 , holyoke , mass . , showing an irish setter , was chosen as international champion of the year .	51.98957
she was awarded the professional handlers ' ass ' ns ' leonard brumby , sr . memorial trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the junior classes .	44.602886
betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year .	113.0227
in addition to showing an irish setter throughout the year , she also scored with an afghan .	48.86414
sydney le blanc , age 15 , staten island , n . y . , showing a doberman pinscher , was 2nd .	26.02364
susan hackmann , age 14 , from baltimore , md . , showing a dachshund , was 3rd .	53.024757
last year susan also placed 3rd in the finals at westminster .	27.384104
from the records we keep -- susan is the only junior who has placed in the junior classes in both united states and canada .	48.51433
karen marcmann , age 16 , trapp , penna . , showing a keeshond was 4th .	189.74603
most juniors who were entered in the finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in junior classes but score in the breed classes as well .	116.4414
in 1960 , there were 7287 entries in the junior classes .	9.938572
each year these shows have increased in entries .	6.9140368
next year 1962 , at westminster , the bench show committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more junior classes in the open division only to qualify for westminster .	253.41162
percy roberts , a leading judge will not be at the international show this year for the junior judging contest as he has been invited to judge in australia in march .	76.07085
it has been suggested many times that a class be set up for the juniors who are overage and cannot enter the junior classes .	89.38951
for some time this writer has been suggesting a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the junior class .	43.669304
such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester kc show recently .	162.3206
not only were the contestants pleased with the class , but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day .	86.926346
the intermediates in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the judge .	109.60298
we suggested this class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows .	165.32086
at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated that this intermediate judging class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world .	91.22309
this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .	145.02992
last year robert harris , a leading junior handler entered the dog judging contest ( junior ) at the international kc of chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any junior since the class ' inception .	68.0765
juniors who attend this chicago show should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help to them .	79.58611
superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed handler to judge junior showmanship competition .	41.244312
the founder of the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby , sr . ( for whom the trophy is named after at westminster ) was an outstanding handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division .	82.42101
some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a junior ' s ability to show a dog .	63.522327
to overcome this unfair judging , the a . k . c . requires that a licensed handler be present to judge the class .	63.866898
if the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from handlers , it has been suggested that licensed judges also be qualified to judge this class .	51.322926
by recognizing and helping juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners .	78.05996
the airedale terrier club of america and the kerry blue terrier club of america have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in junior showmanship competition at any show .	99.702614
the kansas city and the topeka kcs are arranging that juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for westminster .	132.59616
the rio grande kc is also considering having their junior classes set up so that juniors can qualify with points for westminster .	222.14404
the american pointer club is still continuing to donate trophies to juniors who win at junior showmanship classes with pointers .	94.635124
traveling through the south -- over 16 , 000 miles -- with two great danes , an afghan , and a persian kitten , we ' ve worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels .	84.43119
my husband enters the motel office , signs up for a room , and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets .	65.28563
`` no ' ' , he replies , `` full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained ' ' .	67.24923
once settled , we ' re careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can ' t do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture .	111.887085
in the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ! !	100.299576
many a motel owner -- when we ' ve stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children .	189.61986
so many times i have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination .	192.70645
is it that they don ' t care ? ?	5.0411353
are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient ? ?	176.98532
at one time , to most americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the united states navy .	105.196434
today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport .	124.372696
there are more than 8 , 000 , 000 recreational boats in use in the united states with almost 10 , 000 , 000 the prediction for within the next decade .	62.582195
about 40 , 000 , 000 people participated in boating in 1960 .	41.806934
boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .	65.47418
boats are operated in every state in the union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the middle west .	84.83022
the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation ' s coastline .	84.83123
but during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock .	99.8812
developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country .	89.456375
no matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile lake texoma , located between texas and oklahoma , which resulted when the corp of army engineers dammed the red river .	87.45019
in 1959 , according to the engineers , lake texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1 , 000 , 000 persons .	69.3682
where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water .	78.95232
providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1 , 800 , 000 boat trailers now in use .	79.386604
it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2 , 000 .	95.39611
the sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace .	153.95836
boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year- ' round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat .	84.40482
today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door .	85.8845
arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun .	230.17369
and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .	73.02741
this year , americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation ' s national , regional and local boat shows .	146.71591
the boats of america ' s trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons .	133.25879
the variety of craft on the country ' s waters today is overwhelming .	160.82036
they range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100 , 000 .	66.57461
boat prices vary according to the buyer ' s desires or needs .	98.60008
in this respect , boats can be compared with houses .	64.19742
there is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget .	150.2416
there is no question as to just what is available .	63.866566
you name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models .	78.704414
there are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips .	108.924
there are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience .	189.18753
you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond .	120.90421
you may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal .	42.983307
you may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks .	63.50531
you may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .	125.04006
designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat .	157.37784
you pay your money and you take your choice .	86.53743
american technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in american boating .	77.93473
i wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , americans excel over any country in the world in the long run .	125.150116
russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance .	57.64718
the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .	101.342125
these engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .	249.99345
their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook , the range being about $150 to $1 , 000 , depending on size .	107.14028
great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country	270.7855
and to making the owning of a boat simpler .	66.05948
there was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel .	52.187424
having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended .	94.36599
marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later .	831.71814
terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles .	173.2134
of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser ' s earning power , credit rating and local bank policy .	115.829315
outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats .	33.164936
terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .	53.01204
when the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go .	274.02707
when air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all .	93.9152
man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft .	212.36731
it was much the same with pleasure boating at first .	63.69157
come one , come all , the water ' s fine ! !	42.654865
as the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do	135.04883
however , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating .	117.85032
laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower .	75.64643
what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .	62.722935
the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used .	61.124348
if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the u . s . coast guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on federal waterways .	73.12351
state numbering laws differ from each other in many ways .	29.277285
fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such as sailboats with no power , to be registered at all .	105.41884
many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators .	94.03565
generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities .	55.821846
it is always wise to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are .	206.88731
ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land	114.36026
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .	154.99445
hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry ' s self originated and directed safety program .	134.68199
foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 .	75.31297
a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers .	91.420746
the industry has been its own watch dog .	15.00263
with u . s . coast guard cooperation , the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety .	105.198944
in 1959 , the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment .	97.62818
a new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at atlantic city , new jersey , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe .	123.24517
in addition to these activities , the naebm , with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue , new york city , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat .	160.1458
it is important to note the work of the united states power squadrons and the u . s . coast guard auxiliary .	23.42959
each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .	235.73438
this year , over 100 , 000 persons will receive this free instruction .	127.52091
as america on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .	77.21685
instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas .	14.688419
the word marina was coined by naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort .	100.32354
currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general store , and a grocery store .	96.59496
yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services .	183.08131
it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards .	210.80208
regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas .	226.24704
boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .	528.22766
a recent survey disclosed there are about 4 , 000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the united states , the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats .	25.711773
the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .	101.33705
in the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves .	91.20618
the main set of bars are the `` tappets ' ' and one tappet is connected to each lever .	19.84841
if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .	79.00097
close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .	37.756336
these can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .	20.566347
the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .	205.75829
in the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called `` dogs ' ' .	84.40825
two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .	48.73317
these slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them .	41.01396
here ' s how the scheme works suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .	65.69951
this also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars .	96.72227
the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets .	122.5047
by this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal .	144.1893
interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red ' ' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear ' ' the signal .	49.222572
this is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant ' ' .	92.7389
a turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points .	98.33522
a signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked .	181.0976
such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face ' ' oncoming traffic .	160.25908
the lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point .	71.50912
if the points aren ' t thrown all the way , the turnout cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be cleared .	36.428486
generally , these locks on turnouts are called `` facing point locks ' ' .	165.3863
figs . 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals .	21.429853
each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart ' ' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled .	127.80886
the lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars .	28.207817
by studying the track-signal diagrams you ' ll note several other details .	298.2862
derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a `` stop ' ' signal -- are used in many instances .	54.86508
`` home ' ' signals have two blades .	8.953412
the blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move .	71.00868
as an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant ' ' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant .	74.35669
in some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution .	83.91668
in other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects .	197.74234
the interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on paul larson ' s railroad follows the fig . 1 scheme and is shown beginning in fig . 7 , page 65 , and in the photos .	91.72645
here ' s how it can be built .	11.614026
the sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig . 7 , most of the bars being 1/8 ' ' ' ' brass in 1/4 ' ' ' ' and 1/2 ' ' ' ' widths .	37.512924
you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish .	96.317986
our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction .	87.287544
when cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk .	49.113728
start with the right-hand piece `` b ' ' , af , soldering it to the lower piece `` a ' ' of the same material but 12 ' ' ' ' long .	79.856125
let exactly 1 ' ' ' ' of `` a ' ' extend beyond `` b ' ' and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees .	73.74354
now lay 12 pieces of af cut 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . .	62.811947
this gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece `` b ' ' .	47.678795
compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` b ' ' .	42.06141
solder this second `` b ' ' to `` a ' ' at right angles .	22.244703
there should be 10 ' ' ' ' between the two parallel members and each should be 1 ' ' ' ' from an end of the long piece .	86.02386
cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a af bar .	39.518692
tack-solder all the 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . pieces to the 10 ' ' ' ' and 12 ' ' ' ' members .	60.544506
these will be drilled and tapped later on .	2380.769
now cut five af locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) .	111.03035
position these using six intermediate temporary af spacers and locate the upper 12 ' ' ' ' bar `` a ' ' .	50.48392
solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame .	18.310625
now place 12 pieces 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long `` tappets ' ' , as they are called .	64.8584
cap with a af bar and tack-solder in place .	88.50162
cap the locking bar spacers with two af directly under the first two `` b ' ' pieces .	46.330418
mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together .	76.41877
placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8 ' ' ' ' from any edge .	72.15133
drill all no . 50 and counter-drill all except the `` a ' ' pieces size 43 .	137.50461
tap the `` a ' ' pieces 2-56 .	3.4489124
now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12 ' ' ' ' and the first two 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' bars ( `` a ' ' and `` b ' ' pieces ) , which are soldered together .	42.262615
either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions .	202.7754
dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs .	73.95373
drill 20 no . 47 holes in the upper piece `` a ' ' as shown in fig . 7 .	37.16212
tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on .	1956.3484
note , 6 and 8 lock levers don ' t require holes for contacts .	24.577148
now reassemble the frame , using af roundhead steel screws and nuts .	42.668
put the 12 tappets and some af locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws .	49.974163
be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . spacer .	24.020535
as an anchor for the spring lock , insert a af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in fig . 7 .	46.69099
drill a no . 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw .	83.136795
drill two no . 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 .	43.066387
number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots .	70.88993
remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth .	71.7839
cut five pieces of af brass bar stock 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	16.271776
these are supporting members for the short locking bars .	20.562872
locate their positions in fig . 7 and drill no . 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame .	75.252846
cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut .	71.79239
drill four no . 19 and four no . 28 holes in the 12 ' ' ' ' long `` a ' ' pieces .	30.386614
draw-file no . 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends .	105.42723
break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer .	559.62915
drill a no . 50 hole 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' from one end and tap 2-56 .	24.755503
) put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar .	34.266068
to find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge .	33.280525
scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1/4 ' ' ' ' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64 ' ' ' ' ) away from the frame edge .	61.092266
total distance is about 21/64 ' ' ' ' .	4.1356907
tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4 ' ' ' ' tappet movement .	88.93103
drill a no . 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end .	45.546062
drill a no . 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in figs . 7 and 8 .	40.688633
repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars .	37.208096
to each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs . 6 and 8 .	61.440292
these will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts .	64.60369
fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times .	126.082016
as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible .	265.72168
a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished .	149.989
each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting .	77.4091
the order of fitting is not too important .	11.014361
however , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back .	262.6873
since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar .	148.3434
figs . 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions .	23.807491
all the bars are cut from af brass .	16.16846
the lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of fig . 7 .	16.184118
bar `` c ' ' is 2-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	22.32014
draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame .	58.40385
fig . 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes .	103.302635
center-punch and drill the no . 31 hole 7/16 ' ' ' ' from one end of the bar .	29.414944
chuck a length of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8 ' ' ' ' long .	108.74056
cut the piece about 9/32 ' ' ' ' or 5/16 ' ' ' ' long and drive it into the no . 31 hole drilled in the locking bar .	53.117493
file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8 ' ' ' ' above the bar .	13.474408
this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 .	101.68929
place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 .	77.298744
scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` a ' ' .	105.79743
see the drawings for the shape of the notch .	97.33191
scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool .	128.43335
we used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about	47.14603
' ' thick and 1 ' ' ' ' dia . fitted on a 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . mandrel .	32.623203
such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts .	365.37344
a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one .	209.4197
endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible .	52.688747
the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it .	109.22458
assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces .	89.54765
all matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis .	300.39438
chuck a 2 ' ' ' ' or 3 ' ' ' ' piece of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool .	43.539528
fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64 ' ' ' ' long on one end , using swiss pattern files .	86.47003
this tool can also be made with a lathe .	311.9764
scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics .	60.35168
without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go ' round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn .	106.76116
math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .	99.74875
it ' s not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science .	129.91171
but because science is based on mathematics doesn ' t mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician .	61.06148
a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems	260.76364
however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding .	80.67699
a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .	221.44128
it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .	75.763466
the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula .	50.236534
this changes the formula to an `` equation ' ' .	2.4119291
the equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .	49.997925
they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes .	102.74482
however , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order .	137.75444
they indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .	18.073639
the symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .	287.5561
the lower number is always divided into the upper number af	215.0623
the symbol for multiplication is `` **b ' ' .	1.9413941
it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row .	72.63225
numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .	64.20094
the result will be the same regardless of the order used .	149.86932
the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .	114.00315
the number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol .	47.813103
when more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct .	62.15638
for example , for the problem af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 .	142.83492
the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers .	58.888588
numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .	46.907448
when solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value .	157.30687
multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right .	70.47739
completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps af .	151.25917
this would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 .	141.57193
this part of the equation would then become 4 .	486.38046
for use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents .	17.14365
the easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .	198.6305
charts for this purpose are available from many sources .	11.081159
they are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments .	125.32898
the various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .	141.32439
shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result .	53.092525
a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation .	49.306507
it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .	93.96892
rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .	397.09866
the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .	159.72034
when it is needed , one formula is as important as another .	69.53441
however , some formulas are used more than others .	83.95077
we ' ll take them in the general order of their popularity .	85.24178
a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine .	114.75684
displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume ' ' .	17.57796
most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions .	192.11346
it is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed .	203.32361
factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine ' s cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant .	39.084583
the constant is , which is one-quarter of 3 . 1416 , another constant known as `` pi ' ' .	133.04076
pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles .	58.527077
actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine .	56.11362
the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders .	44.32134
multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine ' s total displacement .	36.620777
dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .	32.22165
dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) .	18.725246
one inch equals 2 . 54 centimeters one cubic inch equals 16 . 38 cubic centimeters .	58.718445
for example , let ' s consider a standard 283 cubic inch chevy aj .	93.04076
these engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches .	54.631428
the formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes af .	90.22504
to arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right .	68.4872
a cylinder ' s compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder ' s volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber .	34.178154
cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .	24.763199
cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula af .	50.534924
to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level .	93.27922
then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface .	56.541615
this is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .	185.639
such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber .	66.95578
the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity .	115.83251
most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches .	44.211018
however , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .	10.509399
the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used .	55.3505
the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .	61.49469
the volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket ' s thickness in thousandths of an inch .	134.29568
sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won ' t affect the final computation .	92.26848
the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume .	12.515596
another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position .	42.906147
compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth .	48.248074
this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening .	72.456345
the total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume ' ' .	18.115685
after the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula af	78.31781
for an example let ' s dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches .	41.041985
applying these figures to the formula we get the equation af .	6.568297
this method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads .	162.21228
any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed .	64.60012
the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position .	57.30602
there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size .	31.936945
by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three .	65.39359
to simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors .	29.562277
tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .	113.40729
this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft .	36.73707
a tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made .	121.714615
any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics .	39.649345
when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula .	62.383053
to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is af .	22.176367
for an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4 . 00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this af	62.783024
to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is af .	47.31021
using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes af	52.39412
to determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is af .	33.56511
using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes af .	39.92554
-- the best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at ben white raceway has been that of mary liner ( mainliner-highland ellen ) , a member of the dick williams stable , who was clocked 2 25 .	195.96872
she is owned by ralph h . kroening , milwaukee , wis . , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her .	108.09233
other good miles have been by debonnie ( dale frost-debby hanover ) and prompt time ( adios-on time ) in 2 28- 36	134.75703
kimberly gal ( galophone-kimberly hanover ) 2 26 . 2	23.692768
laguerre hanover ( tar heel-lotus hanover ) and monel ( tar heel-miracle byrd ) in 2 34 .	19.156462
laguerre hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait .	176.05684
this colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them .	167.50626
monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races .	62.677315
stardel ( star ' s pride-starlette hanover ) , 2 34 , looks quite promising .	54.579758
fury hanover ( hoot mon-fay ) , caper ( hoot mon-columbia hanover ) and isaac ( hoot mon-goddess hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago .	69.443756
fury and caper worked in 2 35 and did it with ease .	160.93051
they are two good colts of different type .	6.7905636
fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and caper is more the compact type .	88.754166
i have never seen caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so .	122.603386
fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground .	96.04313
trackdown ( torrid-mighty lady ) has worked a mile in 2 33 . 3 .	32.711823
it took this colt several weeks to strike a pace .	168.62373
then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks .	24.342731
he has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse .	76.127594
thor hanover ( adios-trustful hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet .	211.41272
this colt arrived at the raceway early last november , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot .	102.438286
he appeared in the hopples about november 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace .	64.832085
on december 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all the way .	158.52658
this colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease .	157.70215
his best mile to date is 2 32 . 2 .	9.74188
gamecock ( tar heel-terka hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2 32 . 2 .	53.458794
this is one of the best-tempered tar heels ever at the center .	60.726345
the first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare	77.079636
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff .	255.8394
the fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman .	78.9333
being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat .	679.23975
but up to date he has shown as much as any in the big simpson stable .	51.198776
hustler ( knight dream-torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles .	157.40224
torrid freight ( torrid-breeze on hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him .	267.48938
strongheart ( adios-direct gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles .	162.27773
torrid adios ( torrid-adios molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but i like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds .	141.00864
blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me .	86.63681
first flyer ( frisco flyer-castle light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the illinois stakes .	82.00891
the colts in simpson ' s stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers .	250.9519
justine hanover ( sampson hanover-justitia hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2 32 . 4 weeks ago .	132.06638
mrs . freight ( knight dream-miss reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2 35 .	176.47902
hoopla ( tar heel-holiday hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself october 31 and november 1 fighting the hopples .	304.42255
she was then trained on the trot until december 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again .	130.26555
this time she submitted and in a few days was going good .	143.90186
on january 11 she paced a mile in 2 43 . 1-- 38	152.96317
on jan . 21 , , 2 36 .	7.5344653
this filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , valentine day and cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning .	371.3161
she is more like her full brother , taraday hanover , but larger .	463.97073
up to date she is a grand-looking filly .	13.466556
marquis pick ( gene abbe-direct grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time .	50.572624
he is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going .	184.89975
his best mile to date is 2 28- 33 .	24.081795
majestic pick comes next , with a mile in 2 30- 33 . 2 .	30.790731
staley hanover ( knight dream-sweetmite hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class .	163.95573
best time to date is 2 34- 34 .	9.829724
step aside ( direct rhythm-wily widow ) has worked in 2 32 on the half-mile track and shows promise .	57.30801
most of billy haughton ' s 2-year-olds have worked from 2 40 to 2 35 .	125.60227
bonnie wick ( gene abbe-scotch mary ) has gone in 2 36	14.431449
hickory ash ( titan hanover-misty hanover ) in 2 35 .	39.84891
the first time i saw the latter filly she trotted by me and i noticed such a family resemblance that i said to myself , `` that must be hickory ash ' ' .	78.39747
she is a beautiful filly and likes to trot .	18.999294
hickory hill ( star ' s pride-venus hanover ) has gone in 2 33	18.488918

i will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future .	98.32392
i have just seen debonnie and prompt time work a mile in 2 34 , last quarter in 35 . 3 .	132.45012
in going away debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy .	67.569275
they left the three-quarters together and finished almost together .	94.254906
this filly is another adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise .	184.57014
after well broken and equipped with 12-oz . shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , delvin , driving .	191.60472
being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled .	280.2106
she hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , from that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds .	100.11895
rain on friday prevented many workouts , but there were a few miles of note on thursday .	63.701744

the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he ' s always on the lookout for new and better arms .	145.81676
he ' s more than a reader of outdoor articles	966.52606
he ' s a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport .	41.44015
well , if you ' re that kind of sportsman we ' re here to help you .	148.96819
you ' ve probably given a lot of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it ' s not easy to decide on a new one .	99.162865
you still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you ' d appreciate most	217.043
the time to decide on them is now .	15.339246
as a christmas service , i ' ve taken a close look at this year ' s crop of new models .	86.65473
here they are , with my comments and judgments .	45.81809
read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints .	592.0707
first on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense .	113.13021
for me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn ' t constitute a truly new design .	290.4974
such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change arms-making concepts .	183.6465
bill ruger ' s long-awaited deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans	115.57739
it ' s a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail .	249.43797
ruger reports that on his recent african safari the little magnum cartridge was a real work horse .	72.39832
small antelope were generally grassed with one shot , and the magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency	141.7506
the deadliness of the magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me .	119.065926
at least five years ago , tom robinson of marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber , using the now defunct model 90 action in 20-gauge size .	475.31607
after figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in marlin ' s underground test gallery .	147.81926
we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill ruger in his first experiments three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group .	152.42699
ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet .	216.71082
the new , jacketed slug in magnum corrected this .	366.96826
but even without jacketed bullets , i had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year .	160.41252
within half an hour i jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and i caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards .	107.211426
he moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling .	115.51563
three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills .	120.67113
my double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in other respects , it ' s considerably heavier than the deerstalker , which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds .	136.03224
if ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it .	104.92671
the deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp .	112.89649
the 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1 , 850 fps , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges .	207.78185
with five shots at the immediate command of the hunter ' s trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination .	80.92252
the second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the	167.12627
at present it ' s available in one model , the fine and familiar smith & wesson magnum revolver ( about $110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms .	182.98723
, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2 , 460 fps , and it ' s the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range .	97.42139
this is a varmint load , pure and simple	5273.441
it ' s much too explosive for small edible game .	44.32605
it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers .	76.45529
the most intriguing aspect of the s & w magnum chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard	233.76204
rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers .	83.8456
you may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( jet vs . rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting .	89.31035
i tested it in my scoped s & w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun steadily .	153.76378
the fact that the deerstalker and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn ' t mean that 1961 didn ' t see changes in models , actions and calibers .	142.51984
aside from the ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time .	17.023928
here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models .	49.644966
newcomers to the american hunter are the browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles .	161.05203
they have fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood .	149.69904
barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the magnums ( around $170 )	185.66266
shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the magnums except the	49.00424
stock designs are excellent for use with scopes .	11.758431
colt ' s center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with sako actions , regardless of caliber .	417.6364
, af and the magnums , the long action ( about $135 for the standard coltsman and $200 for the custom version ) .	91.8525
previously , fn actions were used for the larger cartridges .	210.897
auto , the sport-king , in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45 , respectively ) .	202.60077
it ' s a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made .	16.226007
magnum rim-fire rifles , 1961 ' s lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) .	39.182896
previously known as jefferson arms , kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle	243.29207
marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings .	47.566162
the model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined	36.163414
rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles .	478.92685
it ' s extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle i tried was completely trouble-free in functioning .	346.0931
the 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer	266.11603
auto , this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip .	28.030415
once again the mossberg targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination .	73.80581
the bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it ' s only 3-1/2 inches long .	116.42041
you can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with	134.07181
shotshells -- to break the little targo clay targets .	21.265818
a trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets .	58.51477
a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available .	254.76178
you can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340tr ( about $40 ) or a single-shot , the 320tr ( $10 less ) .	246.24786
the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it ' s tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds .	90.912125
they ' ll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it ' s almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark .	111.335724
the combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ! !	62.192932
big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the and to the list of model 725 ' s .	76.293015
these are made on special order only , in kodiak grade ( about $310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads	122.784
a shortened version of the highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 .	26.742018
this carbine ( under $140 , about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year ' s model 760 pump with a short-barrel .	76.09293
this design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard .	114.82685
presently , the 742c is available in af .	7.038824
the latest versions of the famous savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design .	87.528076
the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate .	117.99196
a fresh crop of beginners ' guns showed up in 1961 , and they ' re good bets for your christmas gift list if you ' re wondering what to get for a youngster .	78.37732
the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49 ( about $20 , $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous winchester lever-action and featuring the western look .	45.086937
because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model .	383.713
the action is a drop-block , handling all the standard	26.81801
marlin ' s latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it ' s a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock .	111.31024
this is the model 122 ( about $20 )	1.2774178
it ' s a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i . e . , the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot .	83.65192
stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun .	116.95339
single-shot remington 514c ( around $20 ) , which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock	92.150246
it ' s just right for a boy of 12-1/2 .	354.98584
a beginner ' s shotgun has also been introduced this year .	158.50609
the single-barrel stevens 940y ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren ' t strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily .	178.26282
this gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge .	100.27193
there ' s another addition to the stevens line , the pump-action model 77 in ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid ' s gun	62.242058
many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too .	364.8581
although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market .	71.13306
for example , a browning trap version of the superposed over/under , the broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting .	79.21587
the colt line now includes a new scattergun , the standard or custom pump model ( about $90 and $150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 .	176.55124
firearms international has introduced another import , this one from finland .	806.1235
it ' s the valmet ( about $170 ) , a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices .	163.72083
high standard has also added two models to its line .	48.121956
the supermatic trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto .	60.298603
the flite-king trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16 .	93.38536
either model is a very good dollar value .	5.957453
mossberg ' s latest contribution to the field is the model 500 ( from $73 . 50 )	175.3723
this is an improved version of the old model 200 , a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun .	77.368
see page 24 for a complete report on it .	78.120094
jet -- which i coupled with the deerstalker carbine as one of the year ' s two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961 ' s handguns .	139.07559
livery stable -- j . vernon , prop . ' ' .	12.220309
coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old wells fargo building in san francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years .	109.05632
john vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom .	98.832184
he had two interests in life the pleasures of the table and driving .	98.36889
twice a week he drove his tallyho over the santa cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the pacific at the other .	106.22893
the journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze .	97.794754
the southward route was the classic run in california , and the most fashionable .	58.78425
his patronage on this stretch was made up largely of san franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself .	120.6419
they did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco .	146.1921
breakfast was at the palace hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa cruz .	73.91657
gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals .	583.12274
then the chinese hostler , who rode with vernon on the box , would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp .	108.68939
in spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine .	105.07286
they gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare santa lucia fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains .	51.38657
in the spanish days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense .	24.193638
it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar .	172.6772
vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves .	143.42677
my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run .	92.71162
this was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table .	226.45255
vernon ' s office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk art of the period .	51.05583
they advertised harness polish , liniments , ball ' s rubber boots , green river whiskey , hood ' s sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco .	49.39254
the hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove	86.59352
then a porter from manning ' s fish house would trot in with a tray on his head .	113.55544
it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters .	55.493317
vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and manning ' s had been famous for them since the civil war .	74.46154
oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at manning ' s .	102.17276
its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy .	198.2205
in the 1890 ' s the palace hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , john c . kirkpatrick .	167.64857
this dish much resembles the oysters rockefeller made famous by antoine ' s in new orleans , though the palace chef announced it as a variant of manning ' s roast oysters .	123.084366
( gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the palace ' s or antoine ' s .	54.562534
antoine ' s held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding .	76.20906
) vernon , however , held out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a bit of lemon .	118.35802
after the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig	57.644047
this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned .	512.20026
the tallyho had cost vernon $2 , 300 .	9.886669
a replica of two coaches made in england for the belmont club in the east , and matchless west of the rockies , it was the despair of whips on the santa cruz run .	64.162254
one could shave in the reflection of its french-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels .	173.79211
departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals .	142.64548
but for the start of the santa cruz run , the whip fell .	60.682144
the clients boarded the tallyho at the palace promptly at seven .	301.94623
they had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox hunting , was on the bill .	125.32187
there are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right .	125.85761
here is an original kedgeree recipe from the family club ' s kitchen	191.86089
flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled eggs , some buttery white sauce done with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a bit of anchovy .	45.5735
the omelet named for ernest arbogast , the palace ' s chef , was even more in demand .	153.64908
for decades it was the most popular dish served in the ladies ' grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old palace dishes that still survive .	58.863037
native california oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it .	113.93745
fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg .	55.996254
a jigger of dry sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters .	138.15013
louis sherry once stayed a fortnight at the palace , and he was so pleased with omelet arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in new york j . pierpont morgan had come in his private train to san francisco , to attend an episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him .	86.926674
as things happened , morgan was installed in the nob hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent .	248.51764
sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could .	125.907486
twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the santa cruz tour under vernon ' s guidance .	71.257545
in the grand court of the palace , notable for its tiers of moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , vernon ' s station was at the entrance .	69.971954
it was a post of honor , held inviolate for him	79.62764
of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late general winfield scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries .	126.53096
vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly .	129.80966
promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho .	130.52084
he had style he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them .	94.72131
they cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached woodside where the santa cruz uplands begin .	86.0836
the road maps of the region have changed since 1905	689.47943
inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names .	130.39276
once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing .	219.31166
an agreeable ease suffused vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke .	22.6009
vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar .	55.211952
they were no more on parade than was their driver	221.93611
one fork of the road was as good as another .	53.965973
the santa cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the santa clara valley below at the left .	148.93834
the water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery .	14.303222
you arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh .	158.09448
vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage .	162.74834
a number of them must have fallen into disfavor	9416.557
they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management .	107.990585
he was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat .	238.08669
the horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used to say such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins .	276.80887
there was wright ' s , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers .	130.25616
many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days .	44.61664
it was the haunt of writer ambrose bierce , who admired its redwoods .	84.41002
acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to berkshires ) , whose `` carcass sweepstakes ' ' were renowned .	57.86375
their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce	152.72578
put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic cloves .	72.239456
contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime .	29.879087
after this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of sherry .	46.94934
every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed .	78.6705
vineyards and orchards also grew around wright ' s , and deer were rather a nuisance	74.58883
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers .	43.67523
but no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies .	155.89651
no one complained of the white wine either at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint .	92.59092
( the almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height .	101.28985
though creeks in the santa cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle .	175.26595
dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets .	45.10902
the merit of the pie , vernon believed , was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven .	115.04158
the recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this	184.0036
peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set aside .	65.24841
in a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay leaf .	77.79527
let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain .	471.67673
poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool .	59.944096
set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg .	64.957344
those who have never traveled the width and length of this land cannot conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government .	152.77269

a western vacation is practically synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks in this area .	89.90341
a tour of several of them is possible in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can be of equal reward .	130.1423
in california is located one of the most popular of the national parks -- yosemite .	117.00064

built upon seven hills , istanbul , like rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast .	48.012627
it is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses .	104.89919
at the moment , many of these are being pulled down .	138.55684
whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the bosphorus and the golden horn .	98.99373
even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents .	130.47206
for almost 3 , 000 years europe and asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets .	77.703514
founded in the ninth century b . c . it was called byzantium 200 years later when byzas , ruler of the megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself .	232.14748
about a thousand years after that , when the roman empire was divided , it became capital of the eastern section .	57.205196
on may 11 , 330 , a . d . , , its name was changed again , this time to constantinople after its emperor , constantine .	93.50513
in 1453 when the last vestige of ancient roman power fell to the turks , the city officially shifted religions -- although the patriarch , or pope , of the orthodox church continued to live there , and still does -- and became the capital of the ottoman empire .	123.13397
when that was broken up after the first world war , its name was changed once more .	285.4609
rich in christian and moslem art , istanbul is today a fascinating museum of east and west that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the bosphorus and the sea of marmara only a short distance from the center of town .	62.967285
easy to get to , and becoming more popular every year , it is only fourteen hours from new york by pan american world airways jet , four hours from rome .	279.37448
most of the sights lie in the old section across the golden horn from the modern hotels .	91.50042
i started my tour of them at the turkish government tourist office , next to pan american ' s office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the hilton hotel .	114.69153
from there i turned left along cumhuriyet cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left , republic gardens , and came in a few moments to taksim square , one of the hubs of the city , with the monument of the republic , erected in 1928 , in its center .	59.72865
directly across from the gardens i found a bus stop sign for t 4 and rode it down to the bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before i reached the water and the entrance to dolmabahce palace immediately after that .	276.01343
there the bus turned right along the bosphorus , past ocean liners at anchor , to galata bridge over the entrance to the golden horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the bosphorus .	112.97775
across the bridge on the left i saw st . sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the blue mosque .	67.53594
on the other side of the golden horn i rode through eminonu square , with yeni cami , or the new mosque , which dates from the seventeenth century , just across from the entrance to the bridge .	106.50845
passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on the right and pandelli ' s , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it .	97.61088
at the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park .	103.695724
i got off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with st . sophia on my left , the blue mosque on my right , and in a moment came to the entrance of st . sophia .	45.719048
erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous st . sophias , the first of which was begun by constantine , this fourth church was started by justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later .	111.63428
on his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than solomon ' s in jerusalem .	91.86665
a few years later the dome fell in .	2003.9274
nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the eastern empire , where the byzantine emperors were crowned .	23.251013
after the turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets .	134.44408
in the second half of the sixteenth century , sinan , the great architect who is the michelangelo of the east , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome .	88.92751
with the birth of the turkish republic after the first world war , st . sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered over by the moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy places , have been restored .	91.5387
inside over the first door i saw one of these , which shows constantine offering the city to the virgin mary and justinian offering the temple .	59.92766
on the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with arabic writing .	153.8122
the eight green columns , i learned , came from the temple of artemis at ephesus , the others , red , from the temple of the sun at heliopolis .	35.611736
beneath the dome i saw the spot where the byzantine emperors were crowned , a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence .	47.120422
behind this is a minber or moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat .	91.40296
directly opposite is the emperor ' s door , through which they entered the building .	86.19874
outside st . sophia i walked through the flower garden in front of it , with the blue mosque ahead on my left .	51.17937
across the street on my right i saw the hippodrome , now a park .	125.52066
it was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games .	104.7414
statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of crusaders .	38.687584
at the beginning of the hippodrome i saw the kaiser ' s fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the german emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of sultan ahmet , who constructed the blue mosque , more properly known by his name .	83.21628
just before coming to the mosque entrance i crossed the street , entered the hippodrome , and walked ahead to the obelisk of theodosius , originally erected in heliopolis in egypt about 1 , 600 b . c . by thutmose , who also built those now in new york , london and rome at the lateran .	73.909805
this one was set up here in 390 a . d . on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them .	112.75624
beyond it i noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the serpentine column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the temple of apollo at delphi , greece .	132.20253
near the end of the hippodrome i came upon the built column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the colossus of rhodes .	160.19696
retracing my steps to the mosque of sultan ahmet , only one with six minarets , i entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle .	96.5806
one of the most beautiful buildings in istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the seventeenth century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery .	86.014175
the round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer .	137.67912
inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets .	60.628838
back at the kaiser ' s fountain , i walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the column of constantine , also known as the burnt column , at the top on my right .	87.17482
it stands in the middle of what was once the forum of constantine , who brought it from rome .	81.96548
i stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , bayezit , with the bayezit mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it .	137.75674
there i got off , crossed the square , and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come by in this part of the city .	83.01744
called the marmara gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the sea of marmara .	56.36202
after lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street i found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in istanbul .	82.76258
it ' s a great favorite of the university students , and i joined them there for dessert .	174.82016
taking the streetcar back to kaiser ' s fountain , i walked ahead , then left down the street opposite st . sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the sunken palace .	89.023605
actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was built by justinian in the sixth century to supply the palace with water .	73.13119
i found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately .	45.32381
outside i walked past the entrance to st . sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead .	37.07006
just before reaching it i came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an oriental pagoda , with arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the fountain of sultan ahmet .	92.06684
going through the imperial gate in the wall , i entered the grounds of topkapi palace , home of the sultans and nerve center of the vast ottoman empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the church of st . irene , completed by constantine in 330 a . d . on my left , and then , just outside the second gate , i saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the executioner ' s spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims .	78.19265
passing through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , i entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in english for each building .	145.38104
at one time about 10 , 000 people lived there .	769.4817
following arrowed signs , i veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world ' s greatest collections of chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services .	87.97189
next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe .	97.822784
in the court once more , i went right toward the reception house , a long one-story building with a deep portico .	95.93886
going through a door into another small court , i had the throne room directly in front .	54.291805
i walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the treasury , which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on which the sultans sat cross-legged .	100.89611
they are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels .	144.9711
taking the path behind the throne room to the building directly beyond it , the portrait gallery , i went right at the end of it , through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs .	143.33249
( do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals .	34.39724
keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease .	73.248695
do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat .	273.12265
don ' t forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces .	30.237955
clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly .	30.560425
do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit .	129.9293
make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such .	122.1956
don ' t fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops .	50.664513
sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results .	122.902855
do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them .	53.266678
if doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half .	62.53885
if necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time .	67.29968
for roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone .	93.71407
also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals .	124.03878
don ' t practice a new recipe on guests .	34.971203
have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right .	212.43132
do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it .	95.377365
keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator .	85.637665
don ' t plan meals that are too complicated .	58.105156
limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories .	47.015404
do whatever kitchen work , such as fixing a salad , preparing garlic bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead of time .	80.28176
when you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen .	116.24324
( this goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins .	137.36299
don ' t think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world .	37.736908
the simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef .	64.502914
do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up , flames cannot reach the meat .	365.43652
don ' t forget to have a supply of melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use .	37.197594
made of the world ' s toughest unbreakable plastic , melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors .	97.21803
there is even one set that has `` barbecue ' ' written on it .	60.063923
it ' s cheaper to buy wall-tex and cover your outdoor table .	68.71304
or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues .	76.96534
oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best .	212.90823
don ' t forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments .	126.23644
there are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes .	185.40176
with them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in a-1 condition .	93.39632
except when you prepare `` do it yourself ' ' shish kebob or a lobster roast .	225.46945
then you ' ll want terry cloth towels for mopping up .	30.39552
don ' t think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal .	282.09338
in the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace .	65.428116
even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside .	40.983395
summertime supper , outside , is a natural .	60.30326
you ' ll find , once your technique is perfected , that you can cook on a boat with a simple bernz-o-matic .	98.00552
get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot .	39.35587
be sure to get a few more than you need .	62.338387
you will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen -- and need one more to mix the salad dressing .	145.97977
don ' t forget the joys of a meal on the road .	15.761541
if you travel over the vast u . s . a . you will , no doubt , discover that feeding is an expensive business .	72.10019
decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work .	158.67291
a picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience foods .	54.652847
eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings	29.962524
turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas ( gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and -- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit -- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100% more fun .	182.52267
you need a little stove , a coffee pot and a stew pot	199.18999
maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can opener .	131.80655
as you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal .	78.708626
for 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car .	52.19753
spice is a fact of life in the u . s . a . .	40.80602
you only have to think of franks and sausages to know what i mean .	152.56784
go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties .	139.21048
threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast .	97.93045
sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite .	336.3491
a story goes that a certain herr feuchtwanger of st . louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers .	91.54293
so that his customers should not soil their hands , feuchtwanger issued white gloves .	106.87424
discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise .	166.03702
he had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks .	63.564598
years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go ' ' at the new york polo grounds .	32.49811
the nation ' s number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill .	311.97818
either way it ' s hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation .	82.584274
to make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips	1205.8733
-- score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through .	223.46399
this permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking .	169.14822
-- relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns .	261.97604
bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd .	53.781677
-- using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too .	61.318447
watch closely while browning them , as it doesn ' t take long .	35.615074
-- an unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in french dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic .	66.73107
contrary to popular opinion , `` a la mode ' ' doesn ' t mean `` with ice cream ' ' -- it just means , in the latest style .	46.96404
here are a couple of the latest , highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard ! !	71.637955
you ' ll have the neighbor ' s eyes popping as well as their mouths watering ! !	178.19865
1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped , spiced ham 6 sandwich buns , heated	29.989904
you ' ll never hear `` sayonara ' ' , the japanese word for goodbye , from your guests when you give a hibachi party .	61.805946
the fun of toasting their own sausages over the small oriental charcoal burners and dipping them in tasty sauces will keep your group busy -- try it and see ! !	160.38225
1 large onion , chopped fine 2 tablespoons salad oil 1 8-oz . can crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of the juice 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce pineapple chunks	24.203094
2 tablespoons dry mustard water 1/2 cup heavy cream , whipped salt paprika	61.397327
also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl .	288.81622
sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing coal stage .	206.54341

directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery .	122.44051
instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given .	193.13945
ceramic modeling clay red , white or buff .	6.8810863
glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions .	57.217937
use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking .	54.386745
they must be free of oil , wax and dust .	47.409992
the size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed .	43.564106
roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions .	4.3083944
whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay .	104.33365
when mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns .	369.7207
place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects	132.90164
experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) .	56.9078
place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold .	212.22903
to obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges .	87.910835
check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay .	88.69997
be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles .	191.74702
allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) .	186.5064
to release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project	596.619
gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold .	313.59586
slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold .	129.02779
place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action .	55.697254
this will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired .	110.51883
place project on table and carefully lift the mold off .	126.9362
study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections .	10.89849
if clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers .	116.66771
if the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush .	107.22763
make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) .	252.91908
leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping .	59.82308

hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat .	143.1964
menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view .	156.64233
youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet .	58.820282
the gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit .	7.4536934
all are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern .	45.190113
and with passenger weight shifted forward , hotei levels off for speed under power of a merc 800 .	321.79626
the 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard ! !	286.0897
with only two aboard , hotei does better than 27 mph -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop .	131.18266
she also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser .	95.37577
we ' ve been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry .	118.493996
a lot of thought went into storage space construction .	25.40313
there ' s a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items .	126.06357
the cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life jackets , etc . .	64.80906
the aft cockpit has a af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat .	67.34961
on each side of the motor well there ' s storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below .	152.00601
the well itself is designed to take two merc 800 ' s or 500 ' s if you wish and there ' s room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it .	117.9356
needless to say , you can ' t build hotei in a couple of weeks .	69.162
our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $800 .	135.5715
a comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3 , 000 .	5.3414707
consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3 , 000 and your building time is well worth it .	83.667076
a gator trailer , model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways .	71.055145
this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years .	113.40848
all framing in hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings .	202.27304
therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc . , on a table saw .	209.92278
besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze stronghold nails ( made by independent nail & packing co . , bridgewater , mass . ) are used extensively in assembly and weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints .	83.88663
construction follows a thorough study of the drawings .	29.409012
start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor .	77.20377
draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other .	73.02623
in this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes .	91.2569
the transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails .	56.895103
after notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails .	77.09349
all frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , no . 12 nails .	101.172264
the frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines .	53.28554
if notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through .	343.8217
nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking .	39.622906
the jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete .	110.3691
this is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction .	274.2936
be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required .	307.48386
after the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced , a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson .	116.97028
the frames are glued and screwed to this piece .	119.77831
the joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated fiberglas cloth and nailed .	50.544407
it is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced .	191.83984
the keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed .	323.6983
the first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two .	55.036106
the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first .	23.009232
note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end .	43.578735
one-inch , no . 10 screws are used in both cases .	25.86879
a stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one .	235.04552
take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four .	100.76135
then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig .	58.494877
the first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames .	22.497614
the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member .	52.72952
they ' re glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson .	17.650995
a number of c clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets .	43.012974
the battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames .	111.110855
glue and 1-1/2-inch , no . 10 screws are used .	21.186758
placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens .	134.59026
with the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling .	58.471764
the chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending .	105.65601
fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple jig .	81.45985
i clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of sure grips .	106.12119
the aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily .	154.08702
if you don ' t own a planer and don ' t want to buy one , it ' s well worth renting .	31.312912
the planking is five-ply , 3/8-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood .	21.834131
this can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long .	15.7046
plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom .	87.44889
another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening .	103.82105
the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off .	390.50552
i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter cable for this job .	96.29608
it ' s good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw .	242.84352
when cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming .	101.66689
then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens .	38.097538
it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings .	4.180365
the next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points .	85.51818
the bottom planking is applied in the same manner .	8.924357
after planking , the bottom gets a layer of fiberglas .	40.986843
the spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws .	58.62545
then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation .	426.2937
since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area .	69.57378
the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time .	35.174416
a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches .	99.80802
lay the cloth in place and trim it to size .	148.7521
then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin .	117.95253
when the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish .	84.54364
i used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener .	465.97195
using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth .	40.640976
when the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller .	82.3008
be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden .	300.56088
when the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail .	56.166706
then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem .	28.433954
before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline .	50.589413
fiberglas materials are available from glass plastic supply co . , 1605 w . elizabeth ave . , linden , n . j . .	63.8374
the hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , well-braced position .	254.19669
i laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time .	116.172424
for added strength , i also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint .	105.03329
again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed .	36.981995
after trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is installed .	52.069756
this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom .	29.810238
these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry .	345.65707
when they ' re on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten .	199.352
the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace .	37.3189
note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces .	89.954956
all the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood .	87.834785
most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring .	8.645959
these battens are glued and screwed to the frames .	8.042567
with all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line .	105.4139
use one coat of firzite and one coat of marine paint .	31.827585
bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place .	61.682617
after the decking is on , the cabin sides are installed .	238.74821
they ' re followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated .	415.31094
the windshield glass is shatterproof and plexiglas is used in the cabin .	46.792286
inside , bunks are framed up and installed as indicated .	126.76533
a head is a handy thing to have and i installed one under a removable section of the port bunk .	102.56356
the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink .	91.62512
for padding the seats and bunks , i used ensolite , type aj .	153.96275
lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement .	84.03175
available in af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot .	296.59006
it is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year ' round retreat complete in every detail .	253.59764
because of the unique design by the architect egils hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time .	100.53075
most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools .	63.78731
on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim .	128.54695
in recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind .	146.99442
it is a big project , not to be taken lightly .	45.627174
but each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman .	143.7089
the idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization .	151.50648
everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials .	91.615425
wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting .	205.45004
we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan .	109.341354
thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend .	63.74231
the roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days .	87.235405
then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure .	72.78747
due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are .	105.55283
close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used	135.83984
in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all .	45.07352
this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall .	52.465298
at the same time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as well as possible zoning regulations .	31.27085
whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) .	205.11958
be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion .	94.85162
if there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form .	144.73886
where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one .	117.2462
in many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector .	35.928207
these will be available at cost from our plans department .	111.934265
some general things to look for in a site , if you haven ' t already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation .	168.17583
how are the roads , and how will they stand up ? ?	107.28291
a visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative .	89.039055
note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from .	169.30478
will the view be something you can live with ? ?	67.219826
don ' t worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain	24.283222
we will take up alternative foundations later on .	890.344
with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( aja version ) and the expandable ( ajb version ) .	72.70407
this will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony .	93.35277
this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost .	68.97585
bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues .	62.820812
the wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard af and af of a good grade , free from structural faults .	77.86352
they should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected .	109.035416
the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer .	193.68958
the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired .	125.50474
all panel board comes in standard af foot size .	80.94364
it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame .	44.62896
the fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound .	70.96072
the louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation .	201.03052
there are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them .	86.90873
the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .	97.09554
the filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage .	436.75937
the battens covering the joints are of af stock and are applied after the walls are erected .	62.1125
all nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended .	153.76979
note if 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in af , af , and af can be used in making the glass panels .	116.25276
other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim .	318.37195
in any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels .	126.175354
with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool .	94.37539
the drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed .	94.96888
there is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted .	195.72395
the size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column .	107.10882
a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle .	90.96772
a new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle .	100.41882
the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work .	190.91507
the drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws .	143.74432
a coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table	40.57923
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill .	24.155035
presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill .	86.38468
the rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush .	54.13542
be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease .	55.160294
belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount .	67.07948
keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won ' t slip when pulled by hand	70.2426
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings .	18.099146
most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position .	92.10816
the return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved .	144.09465
turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it .	2206.3677
some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key	139.08362
otherwise , you ' ll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use .	105.89787
drill speeds are important if you want a good job .	11.215943
each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked .	203.63632
on most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys .	75.91518
you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool .	295.59903
see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds .	499.5868
generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed .	231.14233
too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools .	331.10577
too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge .	126.81569
the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate .	346.242
there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes .	61.17774
the most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit .	90.45602
all will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don ' t cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts .	79.67188
the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade .	89.93256
since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding .	79.4675
fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way .	82.55502
when drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath .	139.27786
this will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough .	92.457375
another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side .	138.45149
in soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood .	68.17412
in this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy .	134.66183
when a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark .	123.60777
the depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .	133.37296
the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects .	142.89165
for their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered .	50.05193
in this sequence i shall write about them in the order of their erection .	42.919724
the first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected newbury ( now newburyport ) with salisbury point .	198.6264
its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly newburyport men , petitioned the general court for an act of incorporation .	133.10497
this document began `` no . 1 newbury port , may 30th , 1791	181.80605
`` whereas , a bridge over merrimack river , from the land of hon ' ble jonathan greenleaf , esquire , in newbery , to deer island , and from said island to salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe conveyance to carriages , teams and travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all times of tide .	87.29162
`` we , the subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to this , or a similar writing , we will present a petition to the hon ' ble general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts , praying for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such writing with liberty to build such a bridge , and a right to demand a toll equal to that received at malden bridge , and on like terms , and if such an act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares set against our respective names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of money at such times and in such manners , as by the said proposed corporation , shall be directed and required ' ' .	143.58984
this paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares .	83.35472
a month later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that the bridge was to be built .	45.981285
the matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the court granted a charter on january 9 , 1792 .	99.82911
on november 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened .	65.01148
timothy palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex , or `` deer island ' ' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of william coombs , who received $300 as recompense .	63.989597
this two-part bridge is best described by rev . timothy dwight , president of yale college , in his `` travels in new-england and new-york ' ' , published in new haven in 1821 .	80.32078
`` it consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .	72.42467
the division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch	132.19357
whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark .	171.91313
in appearance and construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge .	78.592995
the whole length of essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four .	156.79651
i have already mentioned that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country .	26.828281
as mr . palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature	119.91083
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention ' ' .	9.216473
it is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby rowley	239.4471
that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was sixteen years old	86.02767
and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , moody spofford .	86.35317
it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth , haverhill , and philadelphia .	110.639626
the essex merrimack bridge when first built was not covered .	184.97542
as far as we know , no american bridge had been thus protected in 1792 .	333.21512
richard s . allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 .	175.08311
its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` massachusetts magazine ' ' in may 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( fig . 1 ) .	44.184475
a brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber .	64.5004
between the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet	50.908398
between the north shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long .	34.82468
a dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place july 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island .	81.984634
it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion .	55.429264
the `` essex journal ' ' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly ciceronian ' ' .	118.67087
the reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because dexter ' s oration could hardly be understood	95.28027
and , although he later explained that he was talking french , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening .	51.01563
the north portion of the essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning .	94.69661
it stood in its original form until 1882 .	4.226146
the southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation .	81.32467
in 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge .	140.50616
this was built by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette county , pennsylvania .	67.93123
timothy palmer had general supervision of the work .	29.338852
an advertisement in the `` newburyport herald ' ' , december 21 , 1810 , shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges .	127.27343
information is hereby given that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport , mass . has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the chain bridge , in the states of massachusetts , new hampshire , vermont , rhode island , and connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges .	42.07481
`` mr . palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it .	125.34315
this chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end .	215.11328
it fell , february 6 , 1827 , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen .	167.73645
the horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned .	54.311474
in spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on july 17 , 1827 .	129.39166
this second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway .	113.63041
the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the county commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways .	109.64971
sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site , may 28th to june 3rd .	108.72868
colonel frederick w . lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott ' s ( now college ) hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel benjamin f . kelley ' s ( west ) virginia infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates .	125.75671
he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction	653.7046
that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the ' 60s .	52.38585
the bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years .	74.53816
twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister .	89.45087
it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on u . s . route 250 -- the old beverly and fairmont turnpike .	99.19422
it is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the u . s . highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days .	63.817947
this covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of june 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story .	84.20331
so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known structures in west virginia .	182.74457
completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth and his brother , eli , of beverly .	141.2218
the chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties .	92.64652
the philippi bridge , however , was the chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders .	289.9177
never rebuilt , the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic .	245.36375
during the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior .	72.56453
union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams .	98.37368
but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when brigadier general william e . ( grumble ) jones reached philippi while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may , 1863 .	257.23013
general jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it .	85.18555
reverend joshual corder , a baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies , to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure	139.86053
he reasoned and argued , pointing out that jones or other confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat .	213.64178
jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the confederate army , while jones and his raiders turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden .	146.52525
again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing confederate force .	303.3954
on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose .	70.11012
centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on may 28th and continuing through june 3rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi .	125.87801
it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years .	270.09583
we have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there .	130.60664
we have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy .	41.191704
we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds .	313.12292
true , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions .	105.865204
but problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows .	369.5848
so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience .	130.32787
position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical .	214.95692
one of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house .	51.414265
the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill .	42.76555
if you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys .	167.98122
you are likely to be nearer the truth .	7.7914143
you can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let ' s-make-your-house-our-club attitude .	178.49103
on the other hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool .	86.87998
another dilemma as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool .	80.43426
yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .	290.67932
as in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good .	94.83752
in the colder climes , for instance , you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best .	153.33517
it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs .	146.24083
even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold .	72.16217
( we do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool .	284.77206
probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts .	141.08005
naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land .	98.91296
but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house .	111.09724
and a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement .	421.52942
the placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety .	196.92117
coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet .	136.28642
eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master ' s delectation .	225.04005
but not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies .	96.749565
we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards .	134.43216
our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled .	434.24478
had we taken a lien on a state park ? ?	115.15233
we had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .	112.35253
from proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks .	178.77646
naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool ' ' were both unexpected and unsettling .	268.54398
after the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result .	137.1181
so rules we made , in unabashed collusion .	37.443325
since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners .	133.19374
first and foremost no one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle .	130.95074
just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view .	103.38384
their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times .	151.0408
no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand .	299.03268
no ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees .	40.248306
we want to know when the potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won ' t end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august .	113.93767
no young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party .	145.8717
and accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities .	62.381
a gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard .	124.07168
no bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run .	213.35114
( sanity , solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop .	453.53915
we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours .	521.90967
this has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate ' ' than ours .	148.76573
we also worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille .	195.94592
we gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides .	112.94624
all dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers ' homes .	130.47585
( to avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area .	101.82069
) we do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences .	113.331116
life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young .	169.92601
safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together .	101.01237
in many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet .	149.10313
but fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay .	94.604675
we allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo .	132.53067
diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ) .	267.70145
and divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge .	91.02751
our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords .	100.067116
all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups .	87.35912
when you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent .	100.21643
you should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits .	203.22707
soignee pools , alas , do not just happen .	58.164787
they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements .	89.326195
unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool ' s pristine purity , its care and feeding -- from ph content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service .	146.10191
of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) .	147.92833
or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers .	112.10113
even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work .	300.80978
a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis .	163.13916
a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight .	128.8968
with or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse .	50.79607
you should see to it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in front of the filter , is always clean .	72.99632
a pool is no place for a shut trap .	35.61846
you should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water .	37.792084
you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing .	214.92575
many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall .	74.88726
as the pool is emptied , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet .	104.02139
much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry .	480.554
if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe , you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out .	85.245155
of course , when your 6-inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties .	77.28164
if your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris .	88.71825
it may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around .	307.11255
once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present .	149.47949
often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense .	240.95015
our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes .	156.711
follow pool-care instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming , `` it wasn ' t my turn ' ' .	91.559
never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship .	199.86615
you may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in .	104.78381
draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania .	155.37161
any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years .	57.54142
fortunately , it is the fha which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress .	159.12868
even if you live above that line , the fha will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged .	150.8502
new simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 .	82.26788
two men can often do the installation in a day .	27.794558
you can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .	108.071556
no less an authority than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs .	42.008095
home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted .	266.42404
we know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want .	171.2176
we know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling .	352.95905
on the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills .	377.53503
the filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever .	99.098434
control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid .	49.770542
heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat .	440.72153
the cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine .	86.897835
the need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent .	389.61346
clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words .	222.53824
when you ' re less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter .	596.7957
the children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms .	91.20009
you ' ll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves .	110.52599
you can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around .	185.85947
best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford .	102.77848
like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more .	81.8091
that brings its per-year cost down mighty low .	24.074038
no matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed .	123.83596
the equipment won ' t take up valuable space either .	240.84952
but there ' s no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year- ' round whole-house air conditioning is when you build .	113.162964
if that ' s done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself .	102.00516
if you can ' t see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later .	480.31073
manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial .	177.11266
if your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it .	122.06393
this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling .	75.38659
you can get year- ' round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow .	141.81104
the units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area .	96.14774
the cooling coil is located in the furnace ' s outlet .	26.974213
from the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement .	80.11479
if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for .	146.06178
be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .	107.493935
be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling .	28.190619
this is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone .	109.55319
be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating .	245.3861
you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .	205.2874
for cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water .	89.03061
instead of radiators you ' ll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat .	97.54429
these systems are more expensive than year- ' round forced air systems .	189.9836
the minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone .	97.171684
if the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system .	47.508038
the simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit .	134.57312
it is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted .	85.446
in a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone .	181.61984
in a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second .	62.04205
in each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control .	305.34586
one of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating .	113.36976
as you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors .	151.74068
a relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors .	96.99171
up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees .	180.25203
now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees .	97.50183
you can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .	222.27597
consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don ' t want to start up your whole heating plant .	98.926254
how large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors .	70.416756
among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family .	89.11964
families with children usually don ' t want the house quite so cool .	242.79176
if you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity .	240.10796
the body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load .	424.18896
cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of aj .	94.820465
a btu is a unit of heat , and the btu rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour .	64.49501
a very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you ' ll need 15 btu ' s of cooling for every square foot of your house .	110.377106
this is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees .	32.364025
you ' ll need more if the high average is above that , less if it ' s below .	226.26279
a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice .	316.01123
by accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12 , 000 btu of cooling in one hour .	132.48422
you may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .	5.8109064
it is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you ' ll get .	97.04829
a 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8 , 000 btu to well over 10 , 000 aj .	167.04477
the safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .	108.78184
don ' t urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough .	64.67933
better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big .	134.14648
reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .	60.772923
an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period .	48.045937
before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low .	131.25024
with a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature .	236.81775
attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately .	150.95549
a well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month .	132.33965
if you have a house which heat doesn ' t penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove .	111.20505
keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you ' ve won the first battle .	105.33407
in a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution .	58.159184
if the house you plan to buy or build won ' t have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .	98.69232
shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .	108.27045
drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house .	44.19754
the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact .	285.8238
the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you ' re going to need .	236.55534
a shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .	179.76062
you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation .	151.45694
restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house .	21.15605
an attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool .	14.878558
you ' ll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one .	125.00824
insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum .	285.41956
in insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 .	8.800871
they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors .	74.3009
such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling .	57.98816
a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent .	18.145325
it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary btu is worth attention .	164.51389
you ' ll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier .	137.65636
it ' s no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum .	126.0245
good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you ' re doing your own contracting , don ' t award the job on the basis of price alone .	59.617336
most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning .	106.0075
you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are	313.7957
you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed .	118.76953
with such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .	48.89529
begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible .	268.68503
these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .	53.61862
the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .	60.365837
these are inexpensive and available from the u . s . geological society , washington 25 , d . c . .	18.766504
in recent years many counties and the u . s . forest service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .	84.10255
most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor ' s office showing ownerships of land .	218.14186
inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation .	86.99758
this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons .	78.70948
it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site .	57.62885
these are a great aid for planning use back at the office .	194.76466
for site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study .	167.25104
however , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .	97.69566
county judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences .	121.42442
a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .	202.52676
this , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision .	58.166946
it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone .	88.50001
usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions .	272.29886
a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water .	136.34883
the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .	222.06853
in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others .	79.417915
how well can the site be developed ? ?	1.2806548
how useful will it be to the public ? ?	18.838375
check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site .	77.23269
naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes .	174.1714
frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water .	92.319305
some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .	250.64447
one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery .	325.596
it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees .	229.53667
a site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .	114.984215
an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .	56.90183
a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs .	75.756676
note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .	71.55322
water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .	80.16539
most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .	179.66576
this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports .	83.612915
a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use .	143.8074
it also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life .	62.766705
the amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important .	66.59677
a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .	60.7465
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .	137.6196
if the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied .	88.59772
a stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area .	110.54144
other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .	180.92773
other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed .	63.202488
just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area .	208.9988
although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .	94.45264
the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them .	346.53683
a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .	99.50851
the fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .	94.420715
fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission .	174.42506
animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .	38.72312
the site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life .	178.7519
clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas .	125.15615
each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .	84.16566
park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .	99.96773
the historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered .	298.68213
notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth ' s crust in your region .	87.23749
those which tell a story of the earth ' s formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .	130.49072
an old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest .	135.82204
some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .	77.22196
how well can the site be developed ? ?	1.2431988
look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites .	85.42795
-- the size of the area alone can be a determining factor .	50.011696
an area may be too small for the needs of the project .	62.72069
areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments .	92.971176
acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .	190.37726
shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development .	75.5979
a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide .	99.589584
this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions .	101.4811
however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman ' s trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit .	126.13625
-- the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there .	79.13927
for instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not .	88.000465
the utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .	54.400803
check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil .	171.93527
nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera .	57.747547
determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .	184.84695
-- in addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation .	79.13836
the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .	119.818
the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines .	357.67178
figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .	61.632458
-- the existing plant growth calls for thorough checking .	18.10533
look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera .	145.55759
an area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up .	138.53952
some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared .	67.94992
the extent and location of open areas is noted .	102.25649
-- how much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ?	166.58992
an area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use .	34.19781
the direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area .	99.42877
lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable .	84.99282
sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended .	103.256935
-- some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site .	97.22434
your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his 70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because i admire the music of prokofieff	101.664085
and with sober purpose , because the development of prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the union of soviet socialist republics .	42.035316
the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the united states of america was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician .	51.749634
these qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-world war 1 , era .	101.175545
prokofieff ' s outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in america was , indeed , brilliant .	284.4645
prokofieff ' s classical symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties .	168.35844
to the traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism	72.19692
to the neo-classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world .	20.858936
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times	74.52249
certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .	62.7023
i heard the classical symphony for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927 .	58.439316
i myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) .	37.919403
i remember ernest bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon dieu , can anyone take this music seriously ' ' ? ?	153.00905
the answer is , `` yes ' ' ! !	5.678851
certainly , america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure .	29.334047
his life-long friend , serge koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in boston , new york , and washington , d . c . , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation .	42.49775
chicago was also a welcome host there , in 1921 , prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the love for three oranges , and played the first performance of his third piano concerto .	63.320107
`` uncle sam ' ' was , indeed , a rich uncle to prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure `` the golden twenties ' ' .	113.21693
we attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites	150.0166
we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches	123.7365
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .	63.01005
we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers .	65.7867
nevertheless , prokofieff was much influenced by paris during the twenties the paris which was the artistic center of the western world -- the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich america -- the avant-garde paris of diaghileff , stravinsky , koussevitzky , cocteau , picasso -- the laissez-faire paris of dadaism and ultramodern art -- the paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .	118.707535
so young prokofieff was the darling of success in his motherland	76.95532
in the spacious hunting grounds of `` uncle sam ' '	3.8442187
in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .	165.14177
meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .	31.239298
in this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , prokofieff was recalled to his native land .	81.791664
the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist tyranny into cringing submission .	146.26794
after this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men	86.91979
a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure .	216.79228
in this changed world , prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose .	128.66885
here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world .	221.76643
here , prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism -- producing music for the masses .	89.49473
it is at this point in his life that the mature prokofieff emerges .	127.74519
one might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .	165.3189
he accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise .	97.730385
by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people `` i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody .	75.98097
this is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	104.90871
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .	131.66321
and with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music .	193.44684
compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent fifth symphony	116.37523
or the love for three oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , the stone flower .	108.29534
this masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people earthy , salty and humorous .	85.60398
of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .	74.03121
the early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience	537.7078
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .	180.66995
however , in all of prokofieff ' s music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature ' ' -- his craftsman ' s attitude .	68.888985
prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .	58.953995
in orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .	140.78397
his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .	5.501207
his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .	103.23783
his counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .	2013.4385
also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required .	177.39697
that prokofieff ' s harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original ' ' than we prefer to believe .	131.27545
need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .	51.288883
prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .	134.47113
at this date , it seems probable that the name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history , as an effective traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose	86.138954
yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics .	134.4973
certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the western world -- not his experimentations .	104.137924
so prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them .	92.84876
nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .	86.16631
his fellow-countryman , igor stravinsky , certainly did not .	24.96605
why did prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? ?	106.904816
i think the answer is to be found in prokofieff ' s own words `` the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	97.399414
when prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose ' ' , he shaped his talents to his purpose .	38.13257
when stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures .	121.36371
prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas .	61.72357
but stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting .	306.5832
in all his miscalculations , stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments .	106.3706
because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant petruchka , his savage sacre du printemps , his incisive les noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .	94.597595
but time is running out , and many of stravinsky ' s admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma .	113.38463
his various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself supra-expressionism , neo-paganism , neo-classicism , neo-romanticism , neo-jazz , neo-ecclesiasticism , neo-popularism , and most recently , post-serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ! !	294.0421
what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! !	1.6606421
meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist	500.77573
a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem ( the star-spangled banner )	34.66699
a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto	3.3135347
his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular american commercial songs ! !	188.8962
stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home .	180.2062
prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .	421.33932
in the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose .	220.79073
with a large and circumspect 20th-century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children ' s fairy tales -- slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large .	127.38776
of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him	122.59182
it must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose .	256.35718
thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced one of the great composers of the twentieth century .	36.433765
that his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it .	180.23878
that he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture	119.34024
and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-century evidence of the effectiveness of evolution , based on a broad traditionalism for the creative art of music .	86.04109
april 10 marked a memorable date in new york ' s musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states .	60.796513
on that date the musicians emergency fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary .	98.155464
roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell cotman .	90.33653
and like this english master , mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them .	298.00626
as a boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods .	156.86441
his father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature .	94.27477
out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that roy first painted subjects he knew best hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape .	117.64174
it is this subject matter that has brought mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors .	172.06035
mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .	98.54594
like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures .	134.79694
but it did teach roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia .	62.296547
on the death of their father , they returned to their home in batavia , new york .	34.72577
after more years of concentrated effort , roy and his brother max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .	100.73632
during all this time roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods .	84.94177
gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions .	66.92744
but even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! !	252.2024
except for a rich friendship with the painter , chauncey ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- roy developed his art by himself .	150.08902
in the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint .	71.206665
he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium .	114.52719
gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique .	245.85728
it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of batavia .	31.365728
more often than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .	189.59572
what i have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form	253.45209
color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition	50.93002
and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the mason stylemark .	93.13811
finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .	70.93876
but for the technical fact , we have the artist ' s own testimony	27.019178
`` of late years , i find that i like best to work out-of-doors .	162.22334
first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately af inches ) in which i pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns .	158.956
if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , i try to place them in the initial sketch .	82.76925
for me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose .	134.32726
`` i am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him	236.7771
as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .	65.252014
just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition .	103.285194
if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result .	262.23175
out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which i call clicking .	120.56599
`` speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .	135.69865
`` if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , i mean to project equal concern for color .	145.33344
often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .	116.96253
when this occurs , i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field .	57.97345
`` when working from one of my sketches i square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal .	314.44516
when this linear draft is completed , i dust it down to a faint image .	146.69759
from this point , i paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage .	132.12578
however , first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines i have described .	113.389114
then i plan my attack the parts i will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .	134.72284
the longer i work , the more i am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important .	37.59623
trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .	124.25403
`` as for materials , i use the best available .	52.813877
i work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain .	114.13886
in my studio i work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes .	135.25575
i have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an english make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight .	478.2338
after selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water .	225.10541
then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .	86.051384
`` in addition to the usual tools , i make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes .	199.5323
the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist .	64.33517
i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio .	41.321968
`` my brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for i combine the sable and the bristle .	82.95575
and a very large , flat wash brush .	7.242339
the bristles are a fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge .	91.013885
`` my usual palette consists of top-quality colors alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , french ultramarine blue , winsor green , hooker ' s green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , payne ' s gray , charcoal gray , davy ' s gray , and ivory black ' ' .	56.421658
in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here .	153.26888
true , a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory .	115.447075
unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist ' s pictures are full of atmosphere and climate .	181.16385
long observation has taught mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights	285.7461
and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky .	12.758345
in following this general principle , mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .	58.049824
when painting , mason ' s physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind ' s eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .	177.80609
he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject	287.90787
rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .	67.43933
it is for this reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .	156.00368
his pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale	67.831985
they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people .	60.94739
by dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , roy mason has found a particular niche in american landscape art .	106.4759
living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all .	110.998215
the artist was born in gilbert mills , new york , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to california , he lived in western new york , in batavia .	52.23742
when i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march 15th , i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist the water sign of pisces ( february 18 thru march 20 ) .	88.00483
and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again , in his natal month of march ! !	195.47661
over the years , beginning in 1929 , mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals	172.7304
the blair purchase prize for watercolor , art institute of chicago	40.827175
and others in buffalo , new york , chautauqua , new haven , rochester , rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the laguna beach art association ,	54.05972
he was elected to the national academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first ranger fund purchase prize at the academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to academicianship in 1940 .	78.7566
other memberships include the american watercolor society , philadelphia water color club , allied artists of america , audubon artists , baltimore watercolor society .	249.05908
the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts in the 1960 olympics for one reason -- they were better .	132.46529
they were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers .	155.26941
our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance .	259.86185
the russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .	125.54334
after all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics competition .	38.852943
but if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ?	31.48455
it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .	271.22305
taking first things first , let ' s understand the sport called gymnastics .	349.2456
it is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work .	85.884056
the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in american gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games .	215.47371
the parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .	76.99426
but the russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance .	216.12746
the gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .	108.97471
in short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well .	41.492493
the addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .	219.48941
another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .	141.88158
( an enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days .	95.04082
most europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries .	43.590466
) in most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him .	128.57397
the american is very lucky if he has three .	113.61654
if a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools .	90.75551
first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .	570.296
oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty .	110.81809
certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .	220.1969
russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800 , 000 competing for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team .	96.4069
eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .	161.13861
we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .	113.458725
and what has dancing to do with all this ? ?	40.680088
russia ' s young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .	125.31303
well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic contest .	101.02003
american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons .	4.771894
they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .	148.87408
they were further stripped of old wive ' s tales by seeing the slender , lovely russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle .	271.0595
president kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation .	113.29237
if we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it .	47.408817
to be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance .	175.46873
if the dance teachers of america make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead .	211.32492
school teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators .	138.24884
there should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it .	161.96556
they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .	167.3822
dance teachers can respond to president kennedy ' s request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .	138.11119
very little in today ' s living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility .	476.59427
they often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength .	65.95684
ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing .	154.99062
even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas .	78.40012
this isn ' t surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in america cannot chin themselves once , and that english school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) .	239.22011
the only area in which american boys hold their own is the baseball throw .	206.94524
for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended .	46.1536
it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .	104.33614
those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it .	342.99982
those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down .	88.47296
when they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up .	54.490486
parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .	86.518036
arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick .	158.12773
keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm .	176.6379
after this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher .	78.6771
follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .	94.4694
push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first .	353.09174
start on the knees in a large circle .	8.058934
fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor .	60.05891
do this exercise six times each class period .	14.149977
as strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward .	211.72707
start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out .	39.39788
try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands .	76.696175
the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .	85.43838
let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down .	178.96326
five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .	209.89935
handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength .	112.17176
of course those who have developed more will find them easier .	216.39899
start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle .	79.37771
at first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help .	126.700615
drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .	84.91124
the right will land first , followed by the left .	62.097366
care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible .	100.24879
this will prevent flat falls and toe injuries .	3.7769532
bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .	86.77597
eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg .	121.400406
the child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles .	108.21868
be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time .	169.95064
the backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results .	134.26706
have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent .	94.017494
place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders .	72.39977
arch the back upwards to make a bridge .	9.108542
be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling .	139.67572
as flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher .	344.17206
later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .	58.12425
to further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle .	40.182484
place the hands in front of the chest .	4.1003094
keep the legs straight and the toes pointed .	6.145916
straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back .	58.82261
at the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head .	54.46021
improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .	30.449228
the last essential to the beginner ' s gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll .	95.773674
this used to be part of every child ' s bag of tricks , but few children can do it today	113.12918
some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .	173.48799
for most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can .	253.39531
after it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) .	92.53822
he places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest .	30.782244
he then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over .	191.95982
one or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo .	61.226677
if , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed .	78.011024
when the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis	164.58763
then no matter what happens , the child ' s performance will be controlled .	41.74808
by lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded .	105.16052
these are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) .	139.88521
even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity .	66.020874
it is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative .	63.962048
and dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .	93.75024
every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics .	152.63136
we have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry .	122.6435
the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .	234.67104
when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .	72.66214
the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities .	107.69161
the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .	128.54965
we use the term `` bio-medicine ' ' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .	33.313206
electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine .	69.83057
recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis .	69.50189
commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices .	157.1746
in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow ' s commonplace equipment originates .	105.97849
from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research .	69.161316
many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .	61.148018
this stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside .	309.04227
a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv system to view the results .	109.64082
fig . 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical electronics center of rockefeller institute .	35.60792
by combining the talents of a medical man , dr . aterman , a biophysicist , mr . berkely , and an electronics expert , dr . zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .	75.1102
three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources .	64.40503
these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror	264.86942
instead of the observer ' s eye the image orthicon in the tv camera does the `` looking ' ' .	99.568405
the microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .	209.22466
the video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen .	166.72884
( note because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor .	113.72727
this assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry .	49.852108
) this is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-tv system which preceded the present simultaneous system .	164.86655
three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube .	18.548761
the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths .	162.64755
many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum .	26.234205
different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .	85.02396
where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail .	135.35234
at the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .	69.34168
the medical title of `` lobar ventilation in man ' ' by drs . c . j . martin and a . c . young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .	106.11775
at the university of washington medical school , the electronics group has developed the `` respiratory gas analyzer ' ' shown in fig . 3 .	108.851265
this unit , affectionately dubbed `` the monster ' ' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient ' s breathing .	52.92412
in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other .	40.243526
usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position .	126.4447
from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .	183.90045
the original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today ' s techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat .	89.34647
for many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed .	69.184235
a group of researchers at the university of washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques .	169.52718
one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched .	84.75025
a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .	267.87473
sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .	75.63056
the travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second	46.65271
thus it takes about 16 msec . to traverse 25 mm . of tissue .	332.7207
a sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation .	169.7174
in addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .	154.09062
the doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .	95.39515
a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself .	46.877544
it uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream .	106.62965
the latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .	37.073112
it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart ' s left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself .	31.68241
this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made .	58.972298
a simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in fig . 2 .	30.645235
outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder .	106.16335
from this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .	214.80978
several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .	199.19864
this original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm . in diameter .	31.543707
battery life limited the use of this `` pill ' ' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .	98.431206
a refinement of this technique has been described by drs . zworykin and farrar and mr . berkely of the medical electronics center of the rockefeller institute .	64.94167
in this novel arrangement the `` pill ' ' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer .	97.51406
as shown in fig . 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc . bursts .	220.01732
the energy received by the `` pill ' ' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring ' ' on after the burst and this `` ringing ' ' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill ' ' .	47.291702
these frequencies are amplified and detected by the fm receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill ' ' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .	74.53223
one of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill ' ' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .	72.78209
applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .	112.40328
one of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body .	31.508265
our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects .	175.09613
various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water .	131.23184
in medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar .	89.65588
because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels .	90.24354
bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .	56.855698
based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through ' ' human organs .	210.87558
a good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by dr . g . baum who has explored the human eye .	107.48133
he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .	783.8248
the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in fig . 6 .	27.009697
the transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown .	147.82982
for display , dr . baum uses a portion of an af , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record .	56.631466
a typical `` sonogram ' ' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in fig . 5 .	61.314587
the frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc . and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter .	160.93765
the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into ' ' all corners .	109.521225
the total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period .	187.91577
drs . howry and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results .	156.37106
by submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in fig . 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights .	68.64712
as mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in fig . 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .	85.489685
arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls .	147.10043
a cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in fig . 8 with the various parts labeled .	66.44867
oersted ' s boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life .	164.54274
he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august 14 , 1777 .	172.09834
his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school .	139.71396
the two older boys , hans and anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german	176.5531
his wife taught the two boys to read and write danish .	61.27005
other brothers later joined them for instruction with oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to bible reading , german , and danish in the informal curriculum .	89.09151
oldenburg ' s contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town ' s learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .	106.70655
from the town surveyor , hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects .	130.54955
the mayor of the town taught them english and french .	36.654808
whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed on to each other	78.908424
they read every book that they could borrow in the village .	24.909912
at 12 , hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science .	61.42603
his earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .	36.814034
in 1793 the brothers decided to enter the university of copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session .	108.9677
while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law .	92.87847
the brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt .	140.6322
they supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could .	141.02832
so impressive were those serious years of study at the university that hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination	90.60585
there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .	113.8189
i lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error ' ' .	157.16187
he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science .	91.20448
in this third year at the university , hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` limits of poetry and prose ' ' .	53.848053
he completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine .	124.22607
he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .	1162.4884
hans ' student days were at a time when europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america and in france , germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the continent .	152.21106
the new century opened with oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .	56.488743
he was stirred by the announcement of volta ' s discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis .	166.53163
the following year he devoted to the customary `` wanderjahr ' ' , traveling in germany , france , and the netherlands , meeting the philosophers schelling , fichte , and tieck .	46.55442
he also met count rumford ( born benjamin thompson in woburn , mass . ) who was then serving the elector of bavaria , and the physicist ritter	97.14204
these were oersted ' s main contacts in science .	228.29503
from gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` the first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .	106.51972
as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes i have invented , i have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in copenhagen i used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me ' ' .	157.36763
oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left .	308.4672
with ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host ' s fertile but disorganized mind .	123.27461
oersted remodeled ritter ' s notes into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france for its annual prize of 3 , 000 francs .	118.9501
the sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him .	110.54102
in may , 1803 , ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy .	115.28633
he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries .	91.55511
thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` leiden ' ' jar by kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile .	106.82527
ritter proceeded , `` you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon .	126.69179
ritter died in 1810 and oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .	124.64509
in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for the university ' s chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist .	131.57991
however , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in german and danish periodicals .	73.9919
in 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .	152.07062
during oersted ' s attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences .	67.91669
he was , however , fortunate in his contact with prof . j . g . l . manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` lion pharmacy ' ' in copenhagen where oersted assisted him .	69.72778
manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted ' s disposal during and after his graduation .	50.81933
in 1800 , manthey went abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy .	53.282963
in february 1801 , oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead .	132.79901
in the following year , 1803 , oersted , simultaneously with davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts .	92.47854
eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing ' ' .	63.806328
he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .	219.61482
the university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .	166.6275
his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him .	138.24
his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .	343.58456
the years 1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again , but on this visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .	107.576744
in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in german and this was issued in french translation ( paris , 1813 ) under the title recherches sur l ' identite des forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .	143.96582
his interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated .	84.26163
chapter 8 , is entitled `` on magnetism ' ' and in it are included such remarks as , `` one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces .	77.412834
the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison .	137.3121
it is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication	274.8173
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference .	191.7729
the form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .	90.30652
there , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism .	50.565727
but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it .	124.65253
one could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do .	249.11716
it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by bruckmann and coulomb .	145.40364
by that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces .	108.68872
an attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such ' ' .	124.44395
oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions .	71.412
in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship .	184.95619
he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .	61.04646
in 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm , one of the danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition .	88.218094
it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , lauritz esmarch , that oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow .	108.085266
together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents .	87.930244
esmarch was among those who witnessed oersted ' s first demonstration of his discovery .	49.492985
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades .	112.32408
electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles .	103.598564
in the late 1700 ' s beccaria and van marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .	127.1398
beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic .	92.315254
the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .	61.566956
the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces .	144.64297
oersted ' s own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .	84.58372
the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of oersted ' s discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 .	103.67436
at this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .	51.28315

there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle ( 1 ) fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons	107.53095
( 2 ) mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface	385.85144
( 3 ) special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides .	85.36279
several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk .	25.260202
the selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference .	209.36038
no one material is best for all situations .	6.3470807
selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem .	83.25108
animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk .	76.96945
these bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence .	174.61229
because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal .	52.333244
filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations .	195.01958
all-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year .	401.8491
this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .	1296.2356
marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs . .	108.96463
companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged r & d facilities , faster new product development .	215.52551
many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .	92.68174
given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	90.63044
based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .	158.5352
there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years	397.81525
frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers .	67.11129
despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer .	377.86624
here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target	65.65338
has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ?	115.524055
have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? ?	125.502884
have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? ?	195.00142
average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions .	41.49084
this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses .	201.10022
have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? ?	22.872734
need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties .	27.627914
first , most products tend to become more complex .	53.009727
second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around .	277.015
providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product .	206.13174
too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .	145.67242
good service starts with product design and planning many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one .	136.47293
proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations .	67.80877
have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ?	110.715836
in spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions .	104.511955
to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important .	108.053734
your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .	143.37344
many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer ' s dollar being spent on their particular products .	137.48703
has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying ' ' area ? ?	116.3557
the trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the southwest and far west , and from city to suburbs .	122.10922
these shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs . .	14.584318
have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? ?	111.58898
we have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends .	76.22342
instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts .	262.10123
the change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .	150.57475
have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? ?	153.55884
in the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .	29.128344
as mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer ' s as well as the distributor ' s profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .	92.74708
average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .	155.9545
moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on .	70.321655
if you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? ?	133.29475
if private brand competition hasn ' t been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ?	276.3594
display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .	22.774313
it has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .	137.1232
how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? ?	192.0825
if you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ?	190.41176
salesmanship is still necessary , but it ' s a different brand of salesmanship .	37.7716
have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ?	1073.7601
have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? ?	96.2169
are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? ?	149.00826
some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes .	77.08658
no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .	124.55597
the use of bulk handling is continuously growing .	18.923813
computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .	342.66946
`` selective selling ' ' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .	99.839386
there may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .	71.92551
do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ?	175.42355
in your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ?	242.77869
will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ?	149.21892
in one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos . .	280.91965
as a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .	66.781555
distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .	163.70552
from the manufacturer ' s point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .	38.34488
it is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition .	86.59865
how much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ?	117.79622
are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? ?	213.30861
have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ?	47.70259
practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon .	98.56126
will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? ?	154.86635
if competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store .	117.703285
on the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive .	372.46735
as markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger .	165.29651
is your r & d or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? ?	69.503784
are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with r & d people ? ?	159.71332
technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it ' s useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register .	106.14224
are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization	221.80597
who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs	40.28101
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ?	238.9735
we have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn ' t make up its mind .	84.19488
in the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .	134.18974
while many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training .	159.42784
nor has the training been enough in relation to the need .	60.865723
most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements .	242.4537
have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ?	122.84386
has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	49.16416
with the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future .	113.83921
men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work .	413.87744
the growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .	53.238712
does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ?	82.771034
does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ?	280.8074
every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning .	123.96139
`` hip-pocket ' ' tactics are going to be harder to apply .	28.358513
many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis .	89.54488
with greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can ' t switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically .	203.60475
are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ?	121.32766
we find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning .	280.93344
are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ?	132.41318
do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr . ) marketing program ? ?	65.9542
the key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company ' s marketing problems realistically .	117.92908
solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .	63.183205
if companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade .	175.10173
the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion .	201.35777
the architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building .	104.72143
ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education .	118.50727
it is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .	184.39648
the element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure .	66.63098
this would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer ' s training .	99.973976
we may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject .	162.77946
the real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ?	196.89114
the american institute of interior designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course .	164.5345
an examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the national association of schools of art , and a further `` on the spot ' ' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .	60.241936
one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .	136.12062
the suggested course of the a . i . d . was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .	110.31964
obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .	306.346
without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer .	68.66797
to begin with , what is an interior designer ? ?	12.831707
`` the dictionary of occupational titles ' ' published by the u . s . department of labor describes him as follows `` designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television .	70.82293
makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes .	112.155716
makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project ' ' .	76.58482
in addition to this the u . s . civil service bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them .	217.22491
he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings ' ' .	114.20327
the interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .	100.658676
yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it .	233.29604
and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .	77.51733
few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum .	113.29264
it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .	109.26656
the old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .	40.325935
as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment ' '	227.51714
no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment ' ' .	91.815155
working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .	190.12805
it is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel ' ' of real interior design demands .	233.10043
unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .	323.48996
it is like medical schools in india where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon .	177.15793
instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .	28.047392
thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .	70.035576
in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .	99.66711
but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .	64.2315
consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .	207.30681
fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade ' ' .	119.78596
even the `` history of furniture ' ' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .	64.967255
here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .	70.75593
the professional organizations such as american institute of interior designers , national society of interior designers , home fashions league and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .	135.06563
certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .	35.621143
not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .	62.5418
participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .	51.7397
the largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .	99.74147
this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .	59.524364
the professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .	138.69261
this seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .	108.570366
in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to the schools .	50.96154
that is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses ' ' in their membership requirements .	84.14162
when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .	106.83404
long hard years of `` on the job ' ' training had brought them to their competence .	51.27926
the necessity of that day has long disappeared .	19.47529
there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .	99.78518
it is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .	55.159164
the reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses ' ' has long since passed .	49.216846
no one can deny that these `` back door ' ' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .	131.00139
beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .	72.26002
it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students .	105.159676
the local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .	105.38426
nor will the hack , the jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .	94.215225
only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .	31.572687
at the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art ' ' .	96.290665
this kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .	97.813644
we must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .	144.63635
considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .	96.33406
in all `` degree ' ' courses in interior design a number of `` academic ' ' or `` general studies ' ' courses are included .	87.936
it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in english , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .	201.62497
the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .	176.24263
the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .	112.55297
one technical question of school organization comes to mind here .	226.89592
for proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate .	135.74092
since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .	328.0829
indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all .	67.202774
the question , however , cannot be ignored for long .	150.05646
the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .	170.72495
most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers .	175.73642
one solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .	79.000145
it is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .	258.3894
this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .	91.82277
only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .	261.0824
it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department .	112.36212
this , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design .	111.17975
in spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .	189.31856
there will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` national association of schools of art ' ' .	213.36151
independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .	139.27695

have you considered gradual withdrawal of subsidies to your in-plant feeding operation ? ?	271.10577
are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings or discussions ? ?	62.869476

have you audited your program recently to weed out those phases that draw least participation ? ?	706.2582

are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services -- flu shots , sun lamp treatments , etc . ? ?	73.48158
if you have an annual or regular physical examination program , is it worth what it is costing you ? ?	57.898914
consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program .	116.2276
too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant .	211.33994
but even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider .	71.61971
in what section of the country are you located ? ?	44.698772
are you in a rural or urban area ? ?	6.456936
these factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .	389.19235
above all , don ' t set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will .	648.44025
unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time .	83.28646
some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere .	312.08694
if you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they ' re entitled to .	216.74141
this can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command .	190.48787
hallmark cards , inc . , kansas city , mo . , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` benefit bafflers ' ' , which it distributes to employees .	48.752895
m & r dietetic laboratories , inc . , columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe .	327.434
u . s . rubber company , new york , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits .	44.086174
the blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs $227 . 72 .	136.8073
have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically .	180.36473
you may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .	165.33986
check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .	127.525055
it can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .	273.047
also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field .	20.874254
this will mean that every time there ' s an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner .	194.60924
don ' t go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .	254.31369
generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .	211.3214
in granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker ' s relation to the deceased must be to qualify .	123.88953
thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin ' s funeral .	84.09837
also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you ' ll probably never use it .	88.7146
coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .	127.37482
vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .	348.51395
if coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group .	232.53537
consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .	5.5098133
make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .	63.8307
otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers .	215.09964
keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .	57.968365
and so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .	222.2322
make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan .	222.74005
younger men usually don ' t think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they ' re liable to change jobs several times before settling down .	171.35342
choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans .	4.195601
there are two sides of a coin for this decision .	123.60965
workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .	128.25789
and they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .	131.56511
a non-contributory plan usually won ' t pay off for the worker until he retires .	72.67617
thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .	11.945137
make sure you don ' t pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .	121.467514
these include leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .	172.11844
consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant .	123.8362
it ' s usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .	208.65836
for example , the friday after thanksgiving can be substituted for washington ' s birthday .	41.66072
this reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .	63.20692
require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .	127.30966
consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .	3.798419
latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .	42.985786
if a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price .	188.6635
if the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won ' t blame the concessionaire .	90.319
check your cafeteria location to make sure it ' s convenient for most employees .	46.790802
you may save valuable production minutes with a change .	83.59331
spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .	145.01332
this will cut the expense of vacation replacements .	8.680409
and with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .	255.97668
also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation .	190.14139
you might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year .	213.1059
the long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .	84.469124
modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .	8.778259
the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .	57.992085
but with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .	186.79031
as the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports .	32.03839
sporting firearms change , markedly for the better .	47.68843
just as modern transportation has outmoded the early studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today ' s sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment .	114.19183
the american firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms .	137.35828
and millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today ' s hunting and target shooting .	115.94966
and due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water .	110.33321
present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .	130.33165
unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year .	99.1833
close to two million game birds were harvested on 1 , 500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on state game commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season .	153.13686
the shooting development program of the sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers ' institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers .	105.0919
the most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves .	163.8554
this has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the new york staff of the sportsmen ' s service bureau , and the saami shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .	59.05762
following the kick-off of saami ' s shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in washington , d . c . .	33.231674
the group known as the american association for health , , physical education , and recreation ( a division of the national education association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the national rifle association , saami and the american fishing tackle manufacturers .	109.648674
this meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the outdoor education project .	154.97589
the outdoor education project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .	167.42914
the various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development .	68.12346
but with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average american man or woman .	127.00481
following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by oep director dr . julian smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs .	156.76624
saami ' s financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .	35.724957
personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to outdoor education .	89.96358
considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .	304.33475
in 1959 saami ' s shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .	123.72075
this program is now nationally known as `` teen hunter clubs ' ' .	9.78542
teen hunter clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the allied merchandising corporation .	78.780785
the first program was sponsored by abraham & strauss , hempstead , new york , under the direction of special events director jennings dennis .	35.971714
other pilot programs were conducted by a & s , babylon , new york	106.77516
other thc activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-tv stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .	89.13179
saami ' s field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 teen hunter club activities which have reached over 40 , 000 enthusiastic young americans .	101.790344
through the efforts of saami ' s shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few .	108.825005
the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .	100.40063
while individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .	91.59878
help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .	169.64136
the american gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .	264.6182
since saami ' s conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the shooting development program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .	66.25418
we trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .	80.441895
are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? ?	16.868393
are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? ?	119.12397
is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ?	88.86935
would you like to organize teen hunters clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ? ?	100.94111
we were camping a few weeks ago on cape hatteras campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on north carolina ' s famed outer banks .	129.357
this beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .	175.52306
with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which americans are camping now .	165.91458
there were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , pop tents , baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .	55.890827
moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .	59.352863
we saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long national seashore recreation area .	269.2505
dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers .	112.92955
here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .	87.233574
almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .	91.39268
you read various guesses on how many americans are camping .	34.638836
the number depends on who is talking at the moment .	12.75131
the figures range as high as 15 million families .	6.9254966
i ' ve heard 10 million mentioned often , but i ' m more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping .	101.10648
seven million families would total 30 million americans or more .	90.81148
consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .	104.57522
harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .	196.28107
they are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .	197.17581
the national parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .	45.37469
the national park service hopes by 1966 to have 30 , 000 campsites available for 100 , 000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present .	133.78647
the u . s . forest service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 national forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .	234.99634
they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .	9.4399395
they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .	304.78278
they come prepared for family fun because americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance .	148.88295
there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .	212.39546
among them , according to the u . s . department of commerce , are ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .	99.236755
the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn .	69.14812
camping is family fun , and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .	290.12848
but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .	347.51944
here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .	163.42342
the american automobile association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 .	137.16473
the aaa then splits it down this way $10 . 50 for meals , $9 . 50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous .	154.4206
what does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ?	134.29504
the $9 . 50 for lodging they save .	51.79133
because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10 . 50 food bill along with most of the tip money .	321.71603
the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can ' t either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .	132.01556
where americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .	137.04646
long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .	137.30032
and even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .	76.58683
it would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they ' re buying the comforts of home .	61.980488
home is the place to find the comforts of home .	21.743568
they ' re buying fun and adventure and family experiences .	199.1257
but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .	256.3259
this is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .	74.59936
today ' s campers want comforts , and they have them .	73.796974
and this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .	216.87024
it ' s fun , and it ' s easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families .	124.76241
neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags .	12.426169
neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .	63.570568
but there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .	173.5998
throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad .	120.6396
since the industrial revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed .	103.80056
there have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn ' t like it	92.44939
the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work	3789.7346
and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions .	300.59598
there have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public ' s dissatisfaction and loss .	88.91437
this has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .	166.83826
the remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash ' ' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates .	228.62338
but the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer .	77.10853
some men have no talent for or interest in management	335.0905
forcing them into management can only create trouble .	12.14897
the old shop adage still holds `` a good mechanic is usually a bad boss ' ' .	27.556793
yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success .	125.20576
labor fights to change its collar from blue to white .	85.65898
all grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .	158.36475
as several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world .	47.38102
what can be done for the `` individual contributor ' ' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ?	83.01997
he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside	141.9075
usually concerned about america ' s belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles .	256.0044
yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title .	155.29376
even the college professor in america has been affected .	24.179228
it is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills .	88.282524
this difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .	299.91876
this leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people ' ' .	69.43552
nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .	215.99188
so we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up ' ' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions .	125.244385
in the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page .	57.39202
among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of general electric .	80.489395
there is no one point in a man ' s career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward .	125.72331
further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path .	243.88306
it is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions .	145.8651
actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services ' ' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities .	187.24529
also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man ' s recognition as a technical expert .	75.82002
as examples at ge glen b . warren , formerly manager of the turbine division , widely recognized as a turbine designer .	49.33242
the late w . r . g . baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the electronics division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant .	81.85538
harold e . strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period vp & gm of the measurements & industrial products division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the switchgear & control division .	96.73162
in the ge plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers .	116.474266
westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist .	106.466354
many companies have systems , particularly in r & d , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations .	101.9433
another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach ' ' .	178.7358
one company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels .	285.55515
there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks	30.996464
the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision .	119.35424
the second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision .	827.1773
the expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level .	119.63378
the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels .	324.58456
in this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere .	173.15286
this reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military .	103.32909
`` we have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer .	151.1297
we have set up a central r & d department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants .	181.34741
a separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs .	397.69708
part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management .	161.14476
these headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design	150.91185
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions .	65.79341
they must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product .	133.48347
`` we do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject .	144.86868
i suppose it is because we are just not big enough .	86.1777
we have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems .	528.2607
the only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by asme , aiee or aiche .	63.33291
i am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability ' ' .	99.089035
`` we have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either .	216.68054
one way to formalize this is in the job structure .	244.86469
we have these positions , which compare directly af	59.991703
`` above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of engrg , r & aj .	104.82729
the latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side .	180.36336
we have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but i believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president ' ' .	66.17256
approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons .	112.493835
the highest position is known as a ' research scientist .	10.783323
the primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society .	188.1794
scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it .	30.633492
we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important	318.32684
and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' dual-ladder ' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions .	168.33092
`` a serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level .	157.16936
with no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance .	135.02531
promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .	274.8899
if no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel ' ' .	108.4647
`` we have two approaches for the technical man the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager	151.93202
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work .	213.62407
these are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige ' ' .	260.8472
`` we have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan .	649.7488
the highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer .	37.68903
the salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) .	54.060818
we also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer .	331.38184
above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder .	147.44116
`` we also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence .	160.36143
these include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers .	122.852104
we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers .	179.89928
publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies .	105.68055
`` a recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for engineering .	53.078175
this function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff .	61.474403
salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management .	69.8749
additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit .	117.25453
`` we presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center .	113.42351
operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status .	22.563976
all scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member .	365.87344
the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community ' s acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field .	115.72983
contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly .	154.93533
`` these recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence .	59.7272
it is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .	281.86545
fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions ' ' .	73.58449
sixty miles north of new york city where the wooded hills of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there is a new home development called `` oakwood heights ' ' .	53.97018
as a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14 , 000 range .	208.58623
but oakwood heights is unique in one particular .	24.671621
its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point .	256.68036
this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state pipeline corporation , with principal offices in new york state .	77.87652
its president is otis m . waters , partner in the law firm of timen & waters , 540-k chrysler bldg . , new york city .	111.57068
vice-president is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter .	58.74121
ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft distributors , inc . , newburgh , n . y . .	44.010777
the idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .	69.084114
not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u . s . and canada , even overseas , write to fueloil & oil heat to inquire if it ' s feasible and where it is being done .	54.599243
its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in new haven described by john schulz in the march , 1950 issue .	87.56193
this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .	81.32785
rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .	32.250156
common complaints included `` mrs . murphy ' ' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` aunt minnie ' ' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .	114.380714
as a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution .	266.4332
a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at oakwood heights .	74.83535
called a `` slo-flo ' ' meter it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles , a key individual being don nelson .	267.84686
tri-state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .	488.23383
there ' s an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed by a lawyer .	131.95224
the earlier new haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .	110.568115
these have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others .	68.96526
in working out the practical legal conclusions president waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .	149.28127
it is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .	136.1982
to overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .	119.08676
when a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to tri-state .	114.45994
for the central storage , tri-state buys one acre , buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece .	642.5325
in other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to tri-state .	130.54955
how does tri-state get its revenue from this plan ? ?	22.747744
it leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position .	61.425144
this first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years .	108.95611
the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties .	119.67418
on this first venture the central storage is 20 , 000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes .	81.63744
the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .	228.04817
however , that is not all he has to do .	67.065094
he must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .	173.66891
in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups .	130.91028
again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best .	209.2902
for this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor .	128.44879
the major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .	103.95753
the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected .	67.183685
for example , the officials of poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .	281.76965
the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets .	155.40495
the public service commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations .	68.39553
several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out .	92.28137
they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies .	89.716995
the government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .	461.90854
there must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity .	89.19386
for a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' x-tru-coat , a product of republic steel corp . , and all lines are welded .	92.85629
they are laid a minimum of 24 ' ' ' ' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking .	213.80728
the meter is mounted high on the basement wall .	17.466743
its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons .	99.02593
it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .	68.42211
ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters .	129.79121
he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .	372.61264
it would be pretty difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhoods , and that ' s an understatement .	113.16857
the job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .	69.06716
but in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .	72.19393
what does tri-state actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for ' ' stage ? ?	139.80885
it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company .	113.97619
it may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .	123.026985
this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully .	128.62537
but it ' s too early yet to go visit oakwood heights .	129.15126
only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor ' s visit on june 8th	38.023254
the big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .	52.066578
a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit .	142.76892
the oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .	65.350105
a primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and tri-state pipeline corporation deserves a very good mark .	80.21315
every year about this time national gargle your cooling system week rolls around .	394.3317
it pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .	285.6077
first , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer .	23.711655
don ' t save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent ' ' type .	99.61613
the word means it won ' t boil away easily , nothing else .	418.61713
the rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don ' t want to risk the rust that two years ' use could mean .	83.84156
if a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner .	121.5488
then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .	19.73538
of course , you ' ll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .	85.66809
now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings .	100.25635
next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again .	113.37365
be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .	22.949919
check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .	39.468945
if you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` dowguard ' ' be sure to check it .	59.089085
dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .	49.634266
check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .	114.68152
take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer .	438.79214
don ' t let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .	297.89285
spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .	171.15408
the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators .	127.33475
if you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat .	66.51549
the thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant .	144.23999
are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?	29.256456
there ' s a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .	213.85419
be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money .	124.0502
first go over the type of coverage you now have .	112.425476
look for these features which may mean you can save	244.89912
for example , don ' t pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy .	113.877106
does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ?	1.8957984
this means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .	102.70945
this applies to repair work of winter storage .	23.631975
with many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .	66.904564
usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .	368.6344
for example if your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made .	313.61142
in the period since the end of world war 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field .	129.48036
the importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone .	64.30321
designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries .	69.10982
many of today ' s developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays	334.98172
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers	115.43882
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc . , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics .	94.23765
there is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .	127.34834
the concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p . 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved .	151.82578
according to a recent wall street journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales .	392.34378
five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing .	59.918633
and it ' s far from the end for plastics .	194.3255
industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960 ' s will be of plastic construction .	152.80971
evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , calif . .	47.33903
four years ago , the company ' s entire line was devoted to neon signs	99.190765
from the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive .	174.76874
aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million .	14.201207
currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components .	98.26046
what accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ?	28.738878
out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important 1 .	254.46617
plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication .	113.37338
according to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit .	238.85034
a 3-by-6-ft . plastic sign weighs about 120 lb . , compared to 275-300 lb . for neon .	89.81515
the weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping .	105.09391
the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed .	108.06053
finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs .	83.63134
they offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer .	91.13587
vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics .	17.064575
pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry .	190.37762
internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night	219.80173
during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest .	73.48855
advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs .	257.2061
among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .	75.39777
for outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture .	153.07976
at present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total .	46.900852
( see panel , p . 166 , for a comparison .	111.24986
of interest is a recent announcement by du pont ' s polychemicals dept . of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as monocite h 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry .	153.82567
sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow .	80.88603
its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to du pont .	88.389725
cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties .	144.8934
its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors .	19.558556
new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color .	39.72513
thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign .	70.423676
( see mpl , mar . 1961 , p . 98 ) .	22.92832
for specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc . , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used .	221.11249
a relative newcomer in outdoor signs is mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) .	63.72104
for outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited .	99.071175
here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene .	13.164492
the final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit .	167.18877
often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques .	111.64082
one of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , and industrial electric inc . , new orleans , la . .	103.48209
the essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within .	268.5568
with the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light .	113.85674
also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign .	106.273766
the copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process .	121.32823
the film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required .	103.691574
spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another	265.1865
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip .	24.938187
panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .	143.30159
signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way .	57.981083
it is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use .	113.77116
trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions .	4.7601957
as used by industrial electric inc . , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters .	178.94806
thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces	1769.6998
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .	106.29302
in this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media .	283.9517
recently industrial electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign .	115.067085
comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit .	98.7928
the triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec . of viewing time for each poster subject .	194.77599
sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft . wide , make up the 25-ft . length of the sign .	102.63734
perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs .	83.92124
signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters .	120.23198
frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc . .	187.86543
the huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them .	79.22225
here are some of the newer items currently available	6.572849
poster products inc . , chicago , ill . a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock .	231.54453
the background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely .	89.7336
the adaptaplex co . , beaverton , ore . letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black .	176.07027
ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel .	148.2507
for large letters , e . g . thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques .	112.12182
for example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in . and six 36-in . red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background .	123.49683
the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb . each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters .	147.19756
stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .	28.915394
for mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels .	39.660397
large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .	17.957663
wagner sign service inc . , chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches .	72.94399
they are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of tenite butyrate .	21.448496
also available from this company are snug-grip plasti-bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material .	56.928913
made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft . , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters .	99.347115
still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by merritt products , azusa , calif . .	72.01113
this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in . ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0 . 080-in . clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side .	139.02216
finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0 . 025-in . aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces .	120.58324
the sheets are extruded of tenite butyrate by jet specialties co . , los angeles , calif . .	30.517605
on large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e . g . right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate .	56.25497
joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft . high and of unlimited width .	294.71954
letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways .	76.8374
don ' t build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out	169.39563
don ' t insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit	96.69746
position your components before you close them in .	196.51389
don ' t wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances .	60.182674
it ' s a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place .	94.432335
set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom .	63.927376
don ' t try to wrestle a 400-lb . tub af through a narrow doorway .	274.36258
finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) .	152.6179
finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .	137.32887
there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished af closet .	66.63257
don ' t position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction	259.4024
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window .	332.79544
you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side .	68.389656
install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling .	73.76907
don ' t close in your house until everything has been carried in .	61.38884
last wall bob schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage .	63.61005
that way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .	103.192696
no auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block .	94.280846
and trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out .	223.45982
new rule no . 3 rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you	237.88432
this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because 1 .	406.14532
it makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside .	90.33007
it makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 .	112.55694
it changes the answers to `` who should do what , and where ' ' ? ?	22.22682
it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper .	127.179634
it changes the answers on when to do what at the site .	62.02395
for example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .	244.45612
instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) .	172.01639
not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct ' ' and short-cutting the dealer .	145.0262
but now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc . .	104.54804
says clarence thompson `` we dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself ' ' .	91.064415
the revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .	339.52823
the revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done	321.1338
five years ago a house & home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealers ' research council reported unhappily	114.93027
`` only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads	21.84227
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads	263.19498
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads	136.76204
only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads .	15.765875
`` so from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing ' ' .	173.41463
`` that house & home round table was the real starting point for today ' s revolution in materials handling ' ' , says clarence thompson , long chairman of the lumber dealers ' research council .	72.93763
`` it made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .	68.95392
before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem ' ' .	19.631239
almost all of the 3 , 000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year ' s new houses are mechanized .	137.52461
there are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it .	275.672
practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles .	83.75105
truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .	191.23679
for some significant new items see the pictures .	16.108576
an nlrda survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling .	244.9177
of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost .	166.62512
most of the others will swallow their $ . 50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer .	81.0522
`` with a 15 , 500-lb . fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $ . 30/mbf compared with $1 . 65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time ' ' , says james wright of aj .	134.63461
lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48 ' ' ' ' wide by a nominal 30 ' ' ' ' high ( or six mccracken packets 24 ' ' ' ' wide by nominal 7 ' ' ' ' high ) .	98.263885
these units make it easy to load as much as 48 , 000 bd/ft ( say 120 , 000 lb in a 50 ' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars .	103.04391
the railroads have responded by adding 20 , 000 more box cars with doors 12 ' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars .	131.70094
first was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40 , 000 lb	30.16049
later came a 1961 cut on the west coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $ . 07/cwt on 70 , 000 lb-plus carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70 , 000 lb .	116.19242
more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and nlrda studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type 6-b floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $ . 054/mbf .	158.12411
for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper .	223.01318
this costs from $ . 75 to $2 . 30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .	98.3832
these carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder	92.78773
says nrlda ' s james wright `` since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer ' s other equipment ' ' .	146.04695
the reason today ' s components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper .	55.663055
so manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier .	129.48357
it cuts the lumber dealer ' s cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading .	84.83564
and it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder ' s high-priced labor to help unload it .	104.91295
says wright `` our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years .	106.28649
and most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles ' ' .	112.62254
restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for	136.65793
half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip .	119.53547
even `` america ' s most efficient builder ' ' , bob schmitt of berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2 , 000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works .	122.434494
already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion .	132.62613
builder eddie carr of washington , past president of nahb , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` scr masonry process ' ' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the structural clay products research foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less .	202.46776
a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43 . 50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7 . 50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages .	232.73094
the scr process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day .	174.51083
one good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew .	70.68825
reports jim lendrum `` by studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .	79.38615
we found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don ' t make two teams	131.44922
we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number ' ' .	110.02414
no house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled .	245.02597
don ' t waste any $ . 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $ . 03 a stud	248.46136
this is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit .	201.35623
green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum .	88.303825
but now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels , green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford .	129.2475
dry studs cost less than $ . 03 more .	1185.5323
so if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds , the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud .	84.342834
there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone .	66.31436
not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance .	72.058426
if you ' ve travelled in europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you ' ve had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic .	163.63528
following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new .	194.08528
however , after you ' ve seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of europe , you ' ll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places .	70.48791
the champagne at troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour d ' argent .	133.7297
you can relive history and follow , in fancy , the crusaders in their quest for the holy grail as they sail out from brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of italy ' s boot .	113.90621
and you don ' t meet the folks from home in northwest spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the middle ages .	108.63836
time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea .	123.415306
they ' ve been there since the days of the moors and the saracens .	92.67361
and what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman ' s village on the mediterranean ? ?	163.06915
an almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road .	108.12831
for those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .	184.814
then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car .	101.530464
the answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one .	67.591415
almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you .	63.598854
you can call one of the car rental services directly ( hertz , avis , auto-europe nationalcar rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well .	202.683
with few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost .	218.25195
you can wait , of course , until you arrive in europe before renting your car .	50.43734
the disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all .	98.101425
since charges are relatively the same , reserving a car before you leave for europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it .	152.2239
for those who plan to travel to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home .	132.50041
at some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries .	119.5182
international touring documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data .	216.54514
a valid american driving license is accepted in all countries except portugal , spain , yugoslavia and eastern europe .	129.23691
if you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your international driving permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3 . 00 .	52.85726
your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , theft , liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries .	82.36181
if you would feel happier with full collision insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance .	102.1692
the average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1 . 00 a day .	59.21237
the charge is variable , however , and goes as low as $ . 50 a day in ireland and as high as $2 . 00 a day in greece .	130.79678
rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of europe .	16.503431
there are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available .	87.24963
as in the united states , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week .	91.58078
it drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days .	27.207705
it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $ . 80 to $ . 90 for the equivalent of a united states gallon and while you might prefer a familiar ford , chevrolet or even a cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller european makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon .	160.70238
your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group .	68.30691
with the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation .	156.85147
there is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn ' t all that much greater than for the wee sedans .	92.734474
the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages .	70.22817
there is the free intra-city `` rent it here , leave it there ' ' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or your hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services .	97.426125
a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits .	69.25236
the investigation will be well worth your time .	10.022318
all model cars are not available in all countries .	180.19719
quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country .	204.76007
if you would like to start your tour in italy , where the rental fees are actually the lowest in europe , fiats in all sizes are available , as are alfa romeo giulietta models .	67.03014
if you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only $1 . 26 a day plus $ . 03 a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station wagon , seating six , at just $1 . 10 a day and $ . 105 a kilometer .	127.453865
if you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn ' t all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $ . 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $ . 30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon .	73.87312
with six in the group , the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee .	180.5073
in the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3 . 00 to $3 . 50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7 . 00 and $8 . 00 a day for the larger , luxury european models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $ . 03 and going up as high as $ . 12 .	74.09337
the same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven .	150.12602
rates for american cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8 . 00 a day up to $14 . 00 a day for a chevrolet convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models .	43.45236
rates in greece and finland are fairly high , actually the highest in europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in ireland .	103.961945
if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to lease a car .	70.03842
the actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car .	74.0321
you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout europe .	136.30533
further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip .	105.40516
there is a fairly wide selection of models of english , german and french manufacture from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 , citroen 2 cv , volkswagens , renaults to the 6-passenger simca beaulieu .	123.88575
leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory .	68.039276
after the first month , rates are considerably less , averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models .	116.94643
there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan .	78.10218
for one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road .	136.31235
then , too , european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them .	171.02495
still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car .	55.437374
the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car .	2.9362278
it isn ' t as expensive as most people believe it to be .	86.518654
your chauffeur ' s expenses will average between $7 . 00 to $12 . 00 a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800 .	108.128365
the big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed .	160.989
since most european cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than american cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large american cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .	161.2433
the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars .	80.72767
however , whether you arrange to have a european or american model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10 . 00 per day per passenger .	120.93686
this will include your helpful , english-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day .	43.46563
if you drive greater distances than that , you ' ll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands .	92.085594
of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you ' ll have a memorable tour , but it won ' t be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you ' ve had a winner in the irish sweepstakes .	69.75698
in american romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute ' ' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn ' t take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom .	88.41308
just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` i wish they were emeralds ' ' .	94.08562
aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on .	105.65884
the way macarthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this af primary stresses on emeralds and wish	174.04852
note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness .	115.5667
conclusions the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .	181.41055
and the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .	266.2419
in other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of english words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white .	121.33627
at this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture	77.787
but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if macarthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo .	87.58168
to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .	194.11499
the point -- quite simply -- is this words they might have had	350.1023
this basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by dr . henry lee smith , jr . , at the university of buffalo , where he heads the world ' s first department of anthropology and linguistics .	48.37895
a brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , smith began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named arthur , who never could make up his mind ' ' .	106.76833
later , he became one of the central spirits of the army language program and the language school of washington ' s foreign service institute .	181.15399
it was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock ' ' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication ' ' .	136.00708
to the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history , socio-economic identity , education .	146.71109
it is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .	95.99986
this , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy .	83.49383
in the early 1950 ' s , smith , together with his distinguished colleague , george trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of birdwhistell ( ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone ' ' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking ' ' with one ' s hands , et cetera .	136.65552
smith ' s first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone .	74.85259
for example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother .	122.33441
the usual u . s . norm would be af middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end .	162.25366
the symbols of mother ' s status , here , are all usual for culture u . s . a . .	185.63132
quite other feelings are evidenced by this style af note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence	137.43317
this is a `` fade ' ' ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother .	180.91435
even less regard for mom and mom ' s apple pie goes with af in other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated .	179.4221
and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired .	163.9745
an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .	382.86496
with this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture .	119.29592
the joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .	85.88413
since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions in new research and training .	123.92143
some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940 ' s demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts .	148.29637
in a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words .	120.25216
at a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists .	119.31612
newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .	212.32985
by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist .	65.20996
linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient ' s voice departs from expected norms .	168.31903
it flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences .	129.3868
interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient ' s vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist .	103.18439
his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient .	252.8542
in one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , the first five minutes ) goes like this the therapist ' s level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you ' ' , which would imply disapproval	95.2428
or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people .	202.48225
the patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral	299.65344
aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed ' ' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i . e . , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before .	101.83754
then she catapults into `` everything and everybody ' ' , putting particular violence on `` everybody ' ' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient ' s general style of speech up to this point .	72.103836
consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention .	250.88899
he may then very well conclude that `` everybody ' ' is probably not the true target of her resentment .	81.433014
immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` i don ' t feel like talking right now ' ' .	58.859364
within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody ' ' truthfully refers to the woman ' s husband .	56.83409
she says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` i keep thinking of a divorce but that ' s another emotional death ' ' .	133.66626
the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence	179.16911
so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .	71.38487
by saying `` another emotional death ' ' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .	94.27698
this the therapist may pursue in later questioning .	16.426609
the phrase , `` emotional death ' ' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative ' ' .	119.631615
since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience .	111.28944
his own communication apparatus operated superbly , and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of dr . blauberman .	82.43398
interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques	297.76718
almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .	137.80444
yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what ' s wrong with him	79.661026
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .	391.66092
naturally , the patient does not say , `` i hate my father ' ' , or `` sibling rivalry is what bugs me ' ' .	28.214624
what he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .	484.92752
some of the classic indicators , as described by drs . pittenger , hockett , and danehy in the first five minutes , are these ambiguity of pronouns	79.87109
stammering or repetition of i , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .	156.84856
on the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean i or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person .	202.89107
the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used	36.686607
therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives .	15.64488
when someone says , for example , `` they took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me ' ' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made .	89.40669
( this patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty .	108.40321
) amateur linguists note here that pursewarden , in durrell ' s alexandria quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship .	81.97669
she was just another freighter from the states , and she seemed as commonplace as her name .	107.865364
she was the john harvey , one of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the u . s . fifteenth air force , to field marshal montgomery ' s eighth army then racing up the calf of the boot of italy in that early december of 1943 .	88.497475
the john harvey arrived in bari , a port on the adriatic , on november 28th , making for porto nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city ' s new and modern harbor .	110.34895
hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole .	605.90717
if anyone thought of the john harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried .	102.819115
it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront .	68.76017
for in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons .	116.72463
throughout the early years of world war 2 , , reports persisted that the axis powers had used gas -- germany in russia , japan in china again .	228.45403
influential people in america were warning the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns .	167.78949
some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first .	645.0814
to silence extremists , to warn the axis , president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august	137.47937
`` from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare .	86.6302
i have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons .	214.69868
`` however , evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources .	161.84244
`` use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .	72.12646
this country has not used them , and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them .	61.68579
i state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies ' ' .	101.88547
the following month the invasion of italy was begun , and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern italy .	108.61251
bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields .	82.96188
it would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below .	195.2993
so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey .	24.49483
a detachment of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under first lt . howard d . beckstrom went aboard , followed by lt . thomas h . richardson , the cargo security officer .	125.48608
only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks .	362.64798
thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at bari .	85.71239
it was the night of december 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in bari .	77.77346
it was getting on toward 7 o ' clock and the german me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit .	102.370316
capt . a . b . jenks of the office of harbor defense was very worried .	221.19244
he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in italy .	54.471912
on november 24th , they had made a raid on la maddalena .	131.81647
two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the me-210 had made its first appearance .	144.79457
after it had reappeared the next two nights , jenks went to higher headquarters and said	112.87884
`` for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures .	76.24268
they ' re just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic ' ' .	115.95033
but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist .	173.5339
even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general peltz , the commander who would conduct the `` little blitz ' ' on london in 1944 , a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously .	67.357956
true , there had been raids on naples -- but naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast .	159.30754
more than that , allied air had complete superiority in the eighth army ' s sector .	87.98893
so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him .	141.5371
for jenks knew that bari ' s defenses were made of paper .	58.13151
the royal air force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available .	477.55447
there were no r . a . f . fighter squadrons on bari airfield .	11.156146
the radar station with the best location was still not serviceable .	46.929573
and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command .	315.07224
it had been made shockingly evident that very morning to ensign kay k . vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the john bascom .	206.94
a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped .	232.41786
then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers .	238.35509
`` this harbor is a bomber ' s paradise ' ' , the britisher had said with frank grimness .	78.8443
`` it ' s up to you to protect yourselves .	23.426167
we can ' t expect any help from the fighters at foggia , either .	77.28562
they ' re all being used on offensive missions ' ' .	11.093405
not fire until the bombs came down ! !	1.0397129
he thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head .	103.297066
like hell he ' d wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ?	190.41904
what would his guns guide on then -- the north star ? ?	184.53308
ensign vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put seaman 2/c donald l . norton and seaman 1/c william a . rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette .	155.20404
below decks , seaman 1/c stanley bishop had begun to write a letter home .	63.15522
above decks on the john harvey , lieutenant richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy .	102.20014
there were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible .	104.3864
bari was asking for it , he thought .	89.82127
for five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold .	117.993706
he hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth .	38.06902
the burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men .	113.868904
lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs .	80.72251
they seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as bari .	88.60705
nine of them had gone down the gangplank already .	1734.5557
deck cadet james l . cahill and seaman walter brooks had been the first to leave .	68.492
richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer ' s stock in trade .	109.68329
the other half of the crew , plus beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard .	81.90578
damned if that wasn ' t a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- porto vecchio .	42.629898
the night was so clear that richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette .	100.743286
then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward .	190.12506
it was a clear night and it was raining ! !	63.08046
capt . michael a . musmanno , military governor of the sorrentine peninsula , had also seen and felt the `` rain ' ' .	58.427837
captain musmanno ' s renovated schooner with the flamboyant name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the sorrentine ' s civilian population .	140.68095
at exactly 7 30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face .	231.15533
he turned the beam of his flashlight on it .	38.99177
it was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating .	114.31305
another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth .	17.408737
it was `` window ' ' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers .	163.5263
unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at bari .	136.87712
they had come from airports in the balkans , these hundred-odd junkers 88 ' s .	42.034203
they had winged over the adriatic , they had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill .	232.83427
they had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares .	204.91399
and they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane ' s spotlight to guide on .	75.76097
after the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until british mp ' s shot it out .	129.10226
in that interval , the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor .	46.966423
merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss .	100.71216
captain musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft .	144.52762
they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under .	119.94738
ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets .	55.71043
most of the junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs .	69.01593
vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire .	52.91194
norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors .	35.86845
bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one , three and five .	122.5436
luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt .	171.04713
the order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks .	95.26819
there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement .	178.0642
you explain , `` i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before .	108.51436
i can ' t tell when , but i ' m positive i witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past ' ' ! !	70.04099
this experience will have happened to many of you .	141.04057
emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when ' ' .	123.16967
most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .	142.27473
in this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually .	88.236015
when a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .	66.30541
occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .	91.5717
one day maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified .	141.71687
rudyard kipling ' s scorn for the `` jargon ' ' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life film ' ' ? ?	136.85938
the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself .	120.35995
one day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` i want a word with you , please ' ' .	62.609173
at that moment kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier .	179.09473
freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .	96.178925
however , readers who accept freud ' s findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his interpretation of dreams , chapter 1	130.68843
as `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams ' ' .	102.45123
dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .	11.2835865
the basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .	108.54794
i recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town .	79.62126
i am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures i have seen .	272.5336
and when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it ' ' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .	109.371025
skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .	184.75935
the question becomes , `` what is a dream ' ' ? ?	10.535401
is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? ?	17.235592
every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .	108.024216
in most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects .	184.19965
but these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don ' t remember having seen in real life .	142.12033
for instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and , with photographic realism , sees smith driving the car	140.74791
whereas , it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car .	167.21219
there is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams .	242.577
the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .	156.18185
a `` mental image ' ' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension .	137.892
dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .	189.31358
as in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .	57.655674
but then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .	153.20311
the opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative perception , in the book philosophies of science by albert g . ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception ' ' .	108.5319
but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ?	54.415085
as retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location .	116.455605
hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness .	111.480644
modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy .	174.86852
we know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc . , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .	159.25316
so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies .	191.77776
this theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .	196.70064
space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions .	55.904533
if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? ?	215.26637
it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future .	182.03394
three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events .	122.4467
the body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies .	152.96155
the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .	149.44408
consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .	47.169415
when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .	125.400955
if the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life .	119.55355
dr . h . v . hilprecht , professor of assyrian at the university of pennsylvania , dreamed that a babylonian priest , associated with the king kurigalzu , ( 1300 b . c . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .	127.67303
as a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by dr . hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .	115.492775
some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest ' s information .	162.79242
dr . hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .	122.31761
he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite , and imagined it must have been german or english .	101.55347
we may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by dr . hilprecht ' s subconscious reasoning .	66.48451
but , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ?	100.24936
that the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor ' s brain , or 2 .	76.15399
that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met ? ?	293.6001
the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vue feeling .	110.50413
no doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper ' s mind .	74.912186
probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake .	175.48999
when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar .	82.31034
nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists .	129.00114
if deja vue is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people .	198.86769
chauncey depew , one-time runner-up for the republican presidential nomination , was attending a convention at saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met .	42.801094
after the preliminary business affair was finished depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for roosevelt .	115.10402
if depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue .	52.80169
but the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .	62.646355
he remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .	102.17827
one week before the convention , depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .	80.94946
`` the food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here ' ' ! !	32.16477
so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from north country school , lake placid , new york .	93.69245
in this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school .	43.896603
because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .	129.74728
when served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities .	150.62128
situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands .	91.95645
these contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight .	261.37286
from fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-september to june .	51.306984
the director , walter e . clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare .	155.52744
to him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind .	96.59519
the concept of good nutrition really began with the garden .	30.102736
the school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school .	76.56503
in a climate hostile to agriculture , mr . clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques .	80.61853
where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail .	111.832146
throughout the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat .	103.16362
mr . clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil .	72.80063
`` to give up these notions required a revolution in thought ' ' , mr . clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading `` organic gardening ' ' and `` modern nutrition ' ' in a search for help with his problems .	75.76238
`` louis bromfield ' s writings excited me as a conservationist ' ' .	51.65485
by 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray .	15.495481
he locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains .	81.19375
after reading `` plowman ' s folly ' ' by edward h . faulkner , he stopped plowing .	86.96842
the basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds .	88.7124
separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .	196.47783
all these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year .	98.807076
it was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader .	56.3406
years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity .	146.94424
soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this .	148.67899
to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , mr . clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth .	123.362755
sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , `` this soil used to be like that hard packed road over there ' ' .	114.687584
`` people and soils respond slowly ' ' , says walter clark , `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program .	83.0543
no chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used ' ' .	11.77208
the garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar .	37.9794
the carrots sometimes don ' t make it through the winter	268.22186
the cabbage and squash keep until march or april .	33.63837
there is never enough corn , peas or strawberries .	31.17082
mr . clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future .	137.09862
a new project planned is the use of bio-dynamic starter .	383.29132
new ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment .	208.50638
`` after the soil , the kitchen ' ' , says mr . clark .	31.461506
the first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread .	99.39099
`` adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push ' ' .	56.09904
at first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves .	282.03702
`` you can ' t make french toast with whole-wheat bread ' ' , was an early complaint .	30.50534
of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better .	190.32779
mrs . clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering .	300.76776
then miss lillian colman came from vermont to be kitchen manager .	168.48373
today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread .	196.53572
mr . clark ' s studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour .	62.417118
once the grains are ground , vitamin e begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week .	149.75717
a mill stands in a room off the kitchen .	47.001217
surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state .	38.394142
miss colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor .	43.082985
she goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding .	34.433224
the bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma .	94.97369
it is well liked by the children and faculty .	181.5833
`` lillian ' s bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much ' ' , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds .	83.53593
the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at one time that was all they ever served .	140.48889
when the chance came , they first eliminated cold cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day .	272.276
they serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal .	7.1193624
occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot ' ' .	104.69177
at the beginning of the school year , the new students don ' t eat the cereal right away , but within a short time they are eating it voraciously .	101.10335
when they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal .	39.0462
the school has received letters from parents asking , `` what happened to johnny ? ?	59.229683
he never used to like any hot cereal , now that ' s the only kind he wants .	113.38192
where can we get this cereal he likes so much ' ' ? ?	15.752814
salads are served at least once a day .	25.19882
most come from the root cellar or from the freezer .	40.224236
sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey .	43.68883
sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today ' ' ? ?	107.496086
the school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs .	92.10847
lots of cheese made from june grass milk is served .	33.020332
hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .	65.15007
organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week .	164.38637
also , salt water fish is on the table once a week .	174.44235
for deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week .	126.941284
most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at least , sometimes at snack time .	200.96698
dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed .	171.93887
apples come from a farm in vermont where they are not sprayed .	21.210297
oranges and grapefruit are shipped from florida weekly from an organic farm .	242.56555
finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem .	42.36067
following a talk by mr . clark at the new york state natural food associates convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from vermont .	138.38687
wheat-germ , brewer ' s yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves .	48.054607
miss colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables .	69.31675
raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves .	43.507214
very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged .	52.124977
pitchers of water merely appear on the tables .	14.727904
the source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues .	169.22914
the cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin c content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible .	497.7831
since mr . clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons .	116.385666
to solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains .	105.53628
on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail .	110.88068
they learn to like these so well that it isn ' t surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time .	95.45735
they tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey .	100.07938
maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .	69.284004
this and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking .	85.04123
parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts , but no candy .	199.76546
mr . clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs .	63.420635
the heavy meal comes in the middle of the day .	13.415254
soup is often the important dish at supper .	4.114912
homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins .	57.483006
the school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality .	103.81595
the cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day .	167.93013
even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , mr . clark felt the school had a good health program .	103.30801
rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule .	54.222275
a vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking .	52.931973
since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof .	265.30386
visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children ' s hair to bring out the sheen .	113.618484
the ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment .	199.381
buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond northfield gulf .	69.42065
wires whined as a cold november blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit .	43.2028
he peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below .	373.54056
`` good old iron compass ' ' ! !	1.0215938
a plume of smoke rose from a central vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights .	156.00784
the girders of a shattered dog river bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream .	159.61603
vermont ' s main railroad line was prostrate .	26.489614
and in the dark days after the great flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state ' s history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the united states mails .	82.122086
rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of friday , november 4 , 1927 , when officials of the post office department ' s railway mail service realized that their distribution system for vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight .	84.35969
clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail .	153.39886
the state ' s railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks .	436.30307
and once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood ' s victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems .	136.82484
from burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across lake champlain to the railroad at port kent , n . y . .	74.31437
the nearest undisrupted end of track from boston was at concord , n . h . .	32.07208
when governor al smith offered new york national guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing burlington ' s bottleneck and that at montpelier too .	131.99641
the question was `` where to land ' ' ? ?	3.1453986
there was no such thing as an airport in vermont .	133.32939
burlington aviator john j . burns suggested the parade ground southwest of fort ethan allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned national guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged `` jenny ' ' and dehaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base .	77.470955
the only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged montpelier was on the towne farm off upper main street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions .	143.42322
over in barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone .	74.69066
anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , granite city citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd infantry , vermont national guard , laid out runways on wilson flat , high on millstone hill .	143.36407
the `` barre aviation field ' ' was set to receive its first aircraft the sunday following the flood .	147.61612
though the makeshift airports were ready , the york state guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule .	104.36709
they had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their world war 1 , planes .	151.47484
it seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air .	239.19398
they had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals .	135.33368
down in concord , new hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time robert s . fogg , a native new englander , had been a world war 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the concord airport .	58.13595
tall , wiry , dark-haired bob fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history .	380.38885
piloting a curtiss navy mf flying boat off lake winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original rural delivery air service in america .	83.16554
during the excitement following lindbergh ' s flight to paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes .	323.83167
in concord , bob fogg was the most prominent new hampshire boy with wings .	389.85934
public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map .	205.81314
the ship was a waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225/hp wright radial engine known as the whirlwind .	151.57382
a trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long , the waco was entered to compete in the `` on-to-spokane ' ' air derby of 1927 .	55.618988
as a matter of fact , fogg and his plane didn ' t get beyond pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers .	245.57175
so with all this experience , bob fogg was a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract .	202.54568
his work began just six days after the flood .	235.63086
by airline from concord to burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier .	86.60839
the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back of the state house when the wind was right , and used wilson flat above barre when it wasn ' t .	111.58935
between the unsafe towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory .	212.61159
each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river .	89.94946
`` but fogg ' ' , they countered , `` we can ' t get over there .	29.436012
and besides you seem to make it all right here ' ' .	15.097545
it took a tragedy to bring things to a head .	63.100075
after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field .	64.96552
sent to montpelier by secretary herbert hoover , red cross aide reuben sleight had been killed , and his pilot , lt . franklin wolfe , badly injured .	163.90094
with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside .	166.0732
faced with this situation , postmaster charles f . mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of berlin .	179.84096
a long flat known as the st . john field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the winooski bridges were at last passable , they decided to use it .	79.146706
with a wary eye on the farmer ' s bull , fred somers of montpelier and mr . st . john marked the field with a red table cloth .	74.28124
as a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling .	76.39429
with these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the waco , bob fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21 , 1927 .	145.71579
each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches .	408.29953
during the second week of operations , fogg received a telegram from the post office department , asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one sunday trip ' ' .	141.4958
since fogg ' s was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions .	189.9759
over the weeks , america ' s first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation .	159.22778
each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home .	95.057144
always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer ' s boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them .	94.04193
a sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit .	61.2343
the airman ' s stock answer to `` weren ' t you cold ' ' ? ?	27.161293
became `` yes , the first half hour is tough , but by then i ' m so numb i don ' t notice it ' ' ! !	78.2354
as daylight began to show through the frosty windows , fogg would place a call to william a . shaw at the u . s . weather station at northfield , vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings .	124.398674
shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station .	107.99053
`` ceilings ' ' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions .	174.36287
later on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank e . hartwell .	161.89522
out at the airport each morning , fogg ' s skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar .	62.223217
( he ' d get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover .	65.83354
) wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , bob fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition .	182.57089
concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the whirlwind ' s exhaust overhead .	104.469604
sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed .	161.01733
plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation .	81.426994
often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the winooski or the white river along the line of the broken railroad .	104.20533
when driving rain or mist socked in one valley , fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the ottauquechee up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes .	244.68738
the dependable wright engine was never stopped on these trips .	89.56846
it ticked over smoothly , idling while fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen , and one from montpelier and barre at the st . john field .	65.65639
sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs ' ' high over the clouds .	128.0616
there he ' d take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he ' d be over the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him .	97.64774
bob fogg didn ' t have today ' s advantages of instrument flight and ground control approach systems .	705.75824
at the end of the calculated time he ' d nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable .	143.1958
usually back in concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of mrs . fogg ' s hot broth before starting the second trip .	88.70107
day after day fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .	90.99839
at fort ethan allen the ever-present wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated .	193.71127
once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved the engine and got the tail up .	257.87204
at a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream .	265.64743
tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet .	63.203094
one afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , fogg took off for concord from the st . john field .	56.599155
if so , are you saying , `` where did the last few years go ? ?	93.77281
how did i get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?	202.44229
what do i do now ' ' ? ?	1.0406947
yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly .	168.07777
somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire .	158.22443
we always thought we would die with our boots on .	327.70093
out of the blue comes talk of pension plans .	60.01405
compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon .	6.0678625
still , it seems in the far future .	12.699736
suddenly , one day , up it pops ! !	7.491258
sixty-five years and you ' ve had it ! !	17.052021
you ' ve thought about it before in a hazy sort of way .	89.06581
never seemed as if it could happen to you	77.62915
a great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers .	17.5938
if so , you are of the old school .	137.39291
you are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose ends .	105.39476
also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word .	279.45242
you never are late for work and seldom absent .	111.46268
actually , you can take no special credit for this .	20.271025
it is the way you were taught and your way of life .	48.594906
all this is standard equipment for a man of your day	69.63694
however , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing .	77.09147
your way doesn ' t seem to be so darned important any more .	365.38705
you realize you are getting in the old fogy class .	94.170135
to put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded .	880.7171
now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and i . b . m . machines .	110.038574
this is followed by a boom in conferences .	22.432287
when a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on .	584.27924
you had your day and it was a good day .	27.266726
well , to get back to the problem of retirement .	85.15774
every retiring person has a different situation facing him .	47.178513
some have plenty of money -- some have very little money .	161.1984
some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids .	138.0497
some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments .	299.1461
some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass .	51.550312
some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything .	163.39389
well , whatever you have , that ' s it ! !	13.602146
you ' ve got to learn to live with it .	39.812122
the question is `` how are you going to live with it ' ' ? ?	21.782412
you can sit back and moan and bewail your lot .	118.295555
but , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged .	119.6909
it seems to me , the first thing you ' ve got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be .	62.23387
make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life .	139.53099
one thing , i am sure of , you must get an interest in life .	70.91955
many of you will say , `` well , what can i do ' ' ? ?	22.198673
there are many , many things to do .	38.711666
find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl .	136.16359
if you can ' t think of a thing to do , try something -- anything .	195.30014
i , frankly , can ' t draw a straight line .	22.570719
maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? ?	135.17819
you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it .	32.418083
anyway , i ' ll bet you have a lot of fun .	28.668854
does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?	109.36471
do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? ?	77.862
there is always a market for this line of work .	94.49954
some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work .	152.35245
where sewing is concerned , i ' m a total loss .	226.45695
when you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and i have to sew them back on , or get out the safety pins .	184.04555
then again , there ' s always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs .	161.49245
not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you .	110.54265
how ' s about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? ?	145.87311
some people love to crack tile and it ' s amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time .	100.744865
do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? ?	47.651394
there is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary .	78.59622
some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood .	46.349133
some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc . .	54.897636
perhaps you couldn ' t do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? ?	71.4783
outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some dandy little gadgets .	137.30261
some women get a real thrill out of housework .	74.69201
they love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball .	149.13727
i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that ' s where it belongs .	414.17517
perhaps you would like to become a writer .	3.5833654
this gives you a wide and varied choice .	3.1977654
will it be short stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children ' s stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious ? ?	60.92098
ever since i was a child , i have always had a yen to try my hand at writing .	187.79897
if you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection .	120.256744

i can hear some of you folks protesting .	14.59805
you say , `` but it costs a lot of money to have a hobby .	44.983303
i haven ' t got that kind of money ' ' .	10.844002
it does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free .	189.96077
how about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? ?	90.45834
also , there ' s scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you .	131.65259
it ' s getting interested in something that counts .	141.66302

keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet .	350.59393
to one and all -- good days ahead ! !	27.006594
what does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ?	225.05045
when we turn to noah webster we find him helpful as usual .	108.711426
`` to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power ' ' .	150.78526
we are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .	209.91478
thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a league of nations or , developing a mature character .	115.16172
all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .	137.90376
while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .	109.28975
an animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .	90.73115
man ' s great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .	68.24987
this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .	156.25218
it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .	218.24062
in our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne come into actuality .	70.248535
the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of 1941 .	184.51717
in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man ' s projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .	75.53315
it is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his creator .	73.8974
not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .	133.08339
we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .	170.79488
we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .	30.994766
by this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .	125.273895
we must realize with prof . charles morris in his the open self that `` man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation ' ' .	111.787094
so far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .	121.37956
is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .	155.54456
is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? ?	136.20256
sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity .	106.097206
some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , victorian past	89.815704
that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation .	166.61026
perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance .	83.86799
joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women .	44.23609
various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .	69.89826
privacy must be highly assured both in time and place .	46.002274
that is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment .	103.28141
if the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other ' s arms will be bliss enough for these few hours .	137.2454
the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose .	135.31168
first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .	77.423645
one thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act .	151.90349
ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion .	89.83943
the hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .	173.37833
( hymen , in fact , is the greek word for membrane .	110.88903
often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse .	72.51071
as might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity .	79.609566
it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one	178.01436
so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations .	210.59824
but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs .	46.71328
some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood .	262.1915
more rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration .	41.79056
extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated .	258.78088
these cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds .	191.65224
in recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .	79.007256
obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation .	65.68244
is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? ?	106.72136
gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .	135.37099
if he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it .	163.77
as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .	137.6654
this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act .	50.390884
the vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation .	42.22095
this is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby .	74.3037
the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .	93.48574
but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .	54.430847
that is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain .	107.5748
the advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .	124.25391
since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .	100.79859
by using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape .	74.25812
in this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .	312.5085
she learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object .	220.58775
apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment .	112.38795
it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation .	273.68442
when no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves .	149.70425
special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .	92.64445
folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints .	383.20047
the long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels .	335.01047
under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .	154.66614
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .	75.69612
but during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain	56.39264
and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .	159.9943
these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .	51.577713
the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind .	335.65454
they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina	52.165592
at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .	168.62204
in fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon .	114.32259
locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration .	108.60019
the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all .	208.28966
ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .	151.64417
the insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen .	89.727905
the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .	153.3748
serious attention must also be given to the husband ' s problems in the honeymoon situation .	56.005493
the necessity for keeping alert to his bride ' s hazards can act as an interference with the man ' s spontaneous desire .	136.88025
the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .	68.83001
this is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife .	123.19076
or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .	146.11327
the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them .	83.451035
the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again .	178.16103
this may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .	77.886505
he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .	141.63965
now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .	263.06046
the accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman .	153.39476
too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment .	48.76327
only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .	93.1927
both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid .	74.63682
if the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older .	144.82787
writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled the nude a study in ideal form , kenneth clark declares `` the human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations .	136.25641
it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves ' ' .	30.797647
perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form .	132.17776
the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality .	107.0108
differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds .	111.05312
whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations .	148.78609
such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked ' ' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period ' ' .	133.55821
attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .	184.76085
the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger ' ' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons .	90.32705
the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man ' s spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration ' ' .	80.63368
one is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .	161.50754
i still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism ' ' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit .	118.85582
in tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .	56.523262
the partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy .	81.35811
at its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares .	157.76132
but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .	263.5075
instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .	17.9722
in the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .	141.74857
but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .	54.972607
in a growing number of american homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .	102.073326
it is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act .	67.327324
it is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband .	243.27931
the whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs .	54.876568
beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .	228.41676
but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .	48.70209
of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned ' ' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .	52.9097
yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .	109.846436
the meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother ' s or grandmother ' s standards .	54.361027
to many experts , this trend was inevitable .	32.802586
they consider it simply a sign of our times .	994.73065
our society has `` emancipated ' ' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .	307.82892
it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .	106.35447
`` the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum ' ' , declares dr . mary steichen calderone , medical director of the planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent book , release from sexual tensions .	101.24991
`` it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .	63.05995
a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too ' ' .	47.64476
yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .	124.77324
it can , in fact , wreck a marriage .	342.39212
when a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife ' s desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .	87.335884
and she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .	48.394325
on the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .	75.97967
he is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well .	172.06093
`` a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband ' s maleness ' ' , declares dr . calderone .	92.89084
this opinion is supported by one of the nation ' s leading psychiatrists , dr . maurice e . linden , director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health .	52.077354
`` when the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous ' ' .	65.911095
in one extreme case , cited by a pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker ' s wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .	149.98083
to win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .	229.3893
caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .	134.82072
while he was in custody his wife divorced him .	109.67664
more typical is the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage counselor .	209.77138
this woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired ' ' for marital relations .	46.519737
to please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .	33.607876
finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .	135.30426
one wife , described by a new york psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood card parties .	306.53552
after every money argument , she rebuffed her husband ' s overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .	71.12488
experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .	763.0088
the wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .	131.03632
she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .	72.45275
the husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is `` don ' t rock the boat ' ' .	90.20963
sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .	75.80604
hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .	211.155
more often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .	222.5584
some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .	530.8494
the wife ' s attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .	104.78841
naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .	111.173546
unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .	118.93956
generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife ' s mercy .	58.423214
`` the pattern ' ' , says dr . morton schillinger , psychologist at new york ' s lincoln institute for psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night ' ' .	74.55622
no one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .	198.97383
after all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as dr . schillinger points out .	163.03735
there is no evidence that these milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .	54.809093
furthermore , dr . calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around .	156.92516
they aren ' t `` frigid ' ' and they aren ' t homosexual	54.886826
they ' re just restrained in all of life .	47.88526
one such man once confided to dr . theodor reik , new york psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .	78.202126
asked why , he replied primly `` because that ' s no activity for a gentleman ' ' .	50.387856
but such cases were , in the past , unusual .	369.58765
society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the bible appears to endorse the concept .	212.7902
family survival on our own western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man ' s strength and ability to bring home the bacon	84.548515
and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .	173.94116
this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring life with father manner .	111.08791
in those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere .	79.096146
`` grandma wasn ' t expected to like it ' ' , dr . marion hilliard , the late toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the ' 90s .	62.012794
wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used ' ' by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were .	134.69342
when did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?	33.65656
some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .	186.25977
virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .	161.5573
left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .	89.01889
circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance .	117.54793
she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .	87.18376
she liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .	68.88997
`` very few wives ' ' , says dr . calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .	114.34794
a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well ' ' .	49.41612
and an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .	231.96115
marriage manuals and women ' s magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .	77.17297
they began to describe in detail the woman ' s capacity for response .	59.936924
in fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , dr . albert ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior ' ' to men .	55.682434
according to dr . ellis , the average 20-year-old american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .	257.47495
not surprisingly , dr . ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .	277.138
yet , paradoxically , according to dr . maurice linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .	249.73146
an aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .	283.9551
`` when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife ' s aggressiveness ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .	39.85654
often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction ' ' .	1.718163
one such wife , dr . linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .	120.61171
but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .	225.26828
then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .	61.9212
in some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .	105.69971
thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .	163.06644
if his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .	175.33107
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .	74.27777
on the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .	204.15775
or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .	237.75958
in any case , dr . calderone remarks , such problems are a couple ' s own affair , and can ' t always be measured by a general yardstick .	70.665695
`` as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates ' ' , dr . calderone declares .	131.62666
`` the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment ' ' .	35.575294
other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .	174.44177
and just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .	152.49045
`` to get a marriage back where it belongs ' ' , comments dr . schillinger of the lincoln institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .	108.69499
he must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .	59.066128
he must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' ' ' .	94.148094
too many husbands , dr . schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they ' re doing ' ' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play .	128.52046
she gave herself a title , lady diana harrington .	5.2133336
the new york d . a . gave her another , the golden girl of cafe society .	123.65623
houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute .	170.34966
and houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on september 20 , 1960 , `` diane harris graham , 30 , d . o . a . , circumstances -- unusual ' ' .	99.57657
early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor .	170.37906
she was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world ' s oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour .	125.71833
she never hid the fact that she liked to play .	34.483257
her neighbors in the expensive houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the golden girl of the mickey jelke trial ' ' .	126.00905
it was the trial of oleomargarine heir minot ( mickey ) jelke for compulsory prostitution in new york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl .	79.838646
( jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls .	141.1172
diane was needed as a material witness in the case and new york police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course .	75.89118
she had been moving in cafe society as lady diana harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns .	67.97426
it was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best .	181.6181
clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to assistant district attorney anthony liebler describe her to the arraigning judge	467.8089
`` this girl is the golden girl of cafe society .	33.414066
`` in 1951 she was a prostitute in new york county .	51.849678
in the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to france , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all europe with him .	162.04019
`` at deauville she met an egyptian by the name of pulley bey .	20.937948
he was the official procurer for king farouk , now in exile .	67.09416
she was in egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty .	180.40155
`` we have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally back into this country .	96.531235
`` our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to jelke ' ' .	17.26534
i am not a prostitute , and i had only one very wealthy boy friend ' ' , she said .	72.83228
during the course of the trial , jelke backed up part of that statement .	489.45084
`` diane is the type of girl ' ' , jelke said , `` who wouldn ' t get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor ' ' .	58.11433
but she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends ' ' .	41.372868
she came to new york from detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor ' ' instead of a chaperone .	62.4045
as she told it , `` he ' s a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 ' ' .	57.966568
she was mary lou brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive .	84.18528
she had talked her `` boy friend ' ' into sending her to new york to take a screen test .	68.3864
the screen test was never made -- but diane was .	1156.3346
she quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business .	329.04895
she seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke .	114.7384
an ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` mr . warfield , the famous producer ' ' .	86.14881
the phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows .	61.2851
`` i ' d love to audition for you ' ' , she gushed .	66.06603
the audition was held a few minutes later in somebody ' s apartment .	87.46783
she thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance .	211.34367
after a few minutes he said , `` i can ' t use you if you dance like that .	85.341675
i ' d like to see you dance nude ' ' .	17.01848
diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again .	144.4101
even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique .	326.0004
when the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` if you go home now , i ' ll scream ' ' .	35.699318
more often than not he would bow to the inevitable .	31.82329
one who needed no such threats was a french financier .	100.03925
one of the blonde ' s yearnings that he satisfied was for travel .	411.11844
she wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a french holiday .	136.1652
in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her .	117.79492
`` then she went to deauville where she met a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers ' ' .	27.825357
the greek evidently fell for her , `` monsieur x ' ' recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100 , 000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables .	106.75953
she could do no wrong at the tables that time .	117.89866
and in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way .	330.66855
smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to paris .	157.98596
no one ever learned what happened to the greek .	1001.6947
the luxury of paris ' most fashionable hotel , the george 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to rome .	194.91405
she teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made nero envious .	111.67383
to climax her roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky hotel excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help .	158.11053
it was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night .	78.3947
discreet italian police described it in a manner typically continental .	58.25591
`` there had been a threesome at the party in the suite ' s bedroom miss harrington ( this was diane ' s choice for a roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known american actors .	118.50281
`` the actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent .	379.86288
the hotel staff , as well as residents of the excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall .	167.05782
`` they were wearing nothing but their scratches .	5.9172697
the girls , after dressing , were indignant .	2.0013747
`` you can ' t do this to us ' ' , diane screamed .	41.121155
in the morning she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally luxurious hotel ambassador .	70.58192
with the ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad .	159.54372
of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do .	50.068653
by this time diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world .	67.84026
she thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in rome , she met pulley bey , a personal procurer to king farouk of egypt .	80.23319
a close friend of hers in the roman days described it this way	377.71906
she had a hard time making him understand that it was farouk she wished to meet .	76.87343
`` pulley bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him ' ' , the friend continued .	35.064034
it seemed as though she were always auditioning .	10.593089
no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see farouk .	114.228
pulley had set her up at the semiramis hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key .	86.496254
she picked her own middle-eastern friends from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzzed around her .	80.72825
tewfik badrawi , mohammed gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of cairo society enjoyed her company .	270.39285
`` so extensive became her circle of admirers ' ' , egyptian police said , `` that her escapades caused distrust ' ' .	55.721348
the roof was about ready to fall in on diane ' s little world , but it took nothing less than the egyptian revolution to bring it down .	122.03059
when farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , pulley bey .	46.206932
they also called upon diane with a request for a look at her passport .	84.170746
the cagey pulley bey , who spoke no english , had taken the passport so that diane couldn ' t leave the country without his approval .	67.059814
officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the united states .	21.364202
and return to the united states she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the new york district attorney ' s office .	61.796192
held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the women ' s house of detention , a terribly overcrowded prison .	71.63885
it is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the district attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at vesuvio ' s , an excellent italian restaurant .	127.74647
newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the district attorney .	43.985653
with the end of the trial diane disappeared from new york .	26.951494
it was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` lady harrington ' ' .	91.95189
several years ago she married a houston business man , robert graham .	126.43488
she later divorced graham , who is believed to have moved to bolivia .	55.421043
houston police got to know diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring .	98.39212
last may , they said , she admitted being a prostitute .	50.32671
the next time the police saw her she was dead .	35.647064
it was september 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles .	69.62556
she had had a party with a regular visitor , dr . william w . mcclellan .	49.09394
mcclellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died .	147.10745
he had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time .	93.02177
when he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police .	98.27288
when the police arrived , they found mcclellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently .	52.681625
the blonde ' s nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her .	136.71535
pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls .	21.083456
an autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in diane ' s body .	97.530014
police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her .	331.85416
`` i think that maybe she wanted it this way ' ' , a vice squad cop said .	36.370712
`` a maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date .	435.66052
she was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens .	366.76254
at least she never knew what the bottom was like ' ' .	27.305416
i work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the east .	41.48817
we cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8 , 000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores .	207.37218
i am selling the stuff of which is made one of the great american dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting .	55.93909
there is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream .	133.36081
from where i sit it looks more like a nightmare .	19.527327
they depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little .	271.26456
franklin d . lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs . claire shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in bakersfield , california , several months ago as a prospective patient .	126.440735
`` doctor ' ' lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes .	50.093037
then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .	120.73214
she had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder .	147.23595
( he explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it .	111.60351
) he knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator ' ' machine .	120.47284
as he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of mrs . shaefer ' s body , lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo .	85.804276
yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her .	73.19873
did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people ' s health ? ?	81.10885
the human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light .	460.59375
for that reason , he informed her , the lord made the sky blue .	156.85416
continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her	78.10326
this machine will cure your cancer-ridden body ' ' .	1.6962639
`` you didn ' t tell me i had cancer ' ' .	24.847054
but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about .	144.89445
why , i once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body ' ' .	96.65965
he urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300 .	119.95264
when she said that she didn ' t have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one .	88.50402
he then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again ' ' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away .	136.29858
lee renewed his pressure on mrs . shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .	88.30425
after another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts ' ' .	88.10964
he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine .	101.00322
when she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , mrs . shaefer felt intense pain .	51.197277
leaving lee ' s office , mrs . shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue .	140.4538
for several days , she was ill as a result of lee ' s treatment .	44.066257
mrs . shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some $30 , 000 for his ozone machines .	248.6535
for mrs . shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee -- and her friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection bureau .	119.262245
and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of lee ' s quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend ' s clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting franklin d . lee .	102.44083
the charge violation of the california medical practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs .	53.316616
the sentence 360 days ' confinement in the county jail .	24.069887
rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases .	82.32557
the machine quack makes his rube goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts .	112.90693
with these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people ' s respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age .	136.12555
he milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer .	178.40286
the gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10 , 000 -- anything the traffic will bear .	123.29995
he may call himself a anaprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor ' ' -- or what have you .	81.59731
not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .	304.26712
the medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines .	149.59993
his plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions .	75.11374
according to the food and drug administration ( fda ) , `` doctor ' ' ghadiali , dr . albert abrams and his clique , and dr . wilhelm reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10 , 000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines .	83.058495
authorities believe that many of the doctor frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .	113.82239
look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in cleveland .	43.70173
sarah gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and mr . a . , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast ' ' and the `` diagnometer ' ' .	58.180153
multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .	77.177315
you will come up with a frightening total .	11.250071
that ' s why the fda , the american medical association ( ama ) , and the national better business bureau ( bbb ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually .	113.16398
the postmaster general recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history .	77.28013
similarly , the american cancer society ( acs ) , the arthritis and rheumatism foundation , and the bbb have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high .	129.69699
for example , the bbb has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago .	266.89453
authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer .	240.49835
in this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .	168.7715
the economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .	24.3831
but it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .	72.04757
by preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity .	186.81953
typically , sarah gross and mr . a both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks .	108.430305
sarah gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .	88.64268
as a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor ' ' was using were phony .	118.631035
she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .	15.214737
mr . a . , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis -- and himself .	102.2329
mr . a has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man .	103.78947
`` that ' s a lot of hard-earned money to lose ' ' , he says today .	23.138807
`` neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor ' s treatments ' ' .	39.396675
and there was the case of tom hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine .	122.58258
after his pains got worse , tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .	91.42192
yes , tom caught it in time to stay alive .	267.91956
but he ' s a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor .	214.73726
but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .	38.659912
in such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor fraud ' s cure-all gadget can prove fatal .	108.878365
moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .	79.14542
in chicago , some time ago , mr . h . , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike ' ' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $306 as a cure-all .	96.88516
`` hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have ' ' , said the company .	146.14247
mr . h . is dead today because he followed this advice .	104.125854
doris hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see otis g . carroll , a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in spokane .	107.98882
carroll diagnosed mrs . hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic ' ' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) .	112.89628
his prescription hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .	77.15182
although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water .	183.54329
inevitably , mrs . hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds .	49.291447
moreover , her husband and child contracted t . b . from her .	36.41356
( small wonder a spokane jury awarded the husband $35 , 823 for his wife ' s death .	31.476915
in california , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of h . f . bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer .	104.35504
he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $185 each .	316.89673
when authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify he was dead of cancer .	130.01167
`` unfortunately ' ' , says chief postal inspector david h . stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court ' ' .	136.71796
that ' s where device quackery can lead .	10.560696
the evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands .	186.05942
who are the victims of the device quacks ? ?	7.0600605
authorities say that oldsters are a prime target .	25.101147
says wallace f . jannsen , director of the fda ' s division of public information `` quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer .	85.06183
people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks ' ' .	139.1008
the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like mr . a . , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to doctor fraud ' s avarice .	95.01223
they are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .	7.555364
ten-year-old richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year .	50.120594
his grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school .	240.10829
mr . and mrs . stewart were puzzled and concerned .	254.14201
then one day dick ' s classmate jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag .	129.76282
the youngsters in the boys ' class had nicknamed dick `` bugs bunny ' ' because his teeth protruded .	84.65836
when richard ' s parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested .	100.87755
during the year that followed , dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance .	196.18227
`` the majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment ' ' , says dr . allan g . brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field .	40.05806
what do parents need to know about those `` years of the braces ' ' in order not to waste a child ' s time and their money ? ?	114.11785
how can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ?	42.948753
why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? ?	1.0140731
occlusion is the dentist ' s expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed .	223.49255
malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for .	171.19417
one main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth .	65.78792
a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion .	78.63307
these two basic malformations have , of course , many variations .	37.31231
a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions	143.59758
a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw .	21.428822
crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth .	375.0392
front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close .	135.81647
upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close .	247.17947
the eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs .	112.45876
second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row .	46.58551
contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition .	86.683784
however , this does not mean that a child ' s teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family .	65.27997
tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it ' s important to remember that there ' s a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits .	57.5704
it ' s perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old .	185.46365
occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster ' s teeth	92.0481
but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect .	102.914566
malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .	174.19116
if a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble .	126.023415
if baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place .	112.04608
every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth .	80.12396
some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed .	79.412155
in certain cases , as in dick stewart ' s , a child ' s personality is affected .	43.13857
yet from the dentist ' s point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons .	215.67572
bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots .	65.097565
this serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults .	52.758278
then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay .	86.30275
`` for these and other reasons ' ' , says dr . brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth ' ' .	19.168161
the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system .	141.1464
because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition .	261.59955
badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping .	75.41618
`` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 ' ' , says dr . brodie .	63.60835
in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy .	247.23428
orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw	155.96365
they are not anchored directly to the bone .	12.439354
abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided .	83.42128
what can 10-year-old susan expect when she enters the orthodontist ' s office ? ?	24.480886
on her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and `` tooth prints ' ' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws .	55.09928
if he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs .	74.87161
this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone .	58.939125
as the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved .	124.99852
this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster .	186.72165
`` if teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place ' ' , explains dr . brodie .	71.768906
`` moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child ' s face ' ' .	58.400898
during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear .	119.20914
parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay .	100.16341
when in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered .	70.209656
next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending on the severity of her condition .	71.17343
during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth .	70.991585
susie ' s teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position .	79.41519
but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place .	74.45511
usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth .	65.281555
susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day .	59.310226
then comes the time when the last wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist .	109.48838
straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months .	114.04148
aligning all the teeth may take a year or more .	34.525345
an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct .	117.26476
the charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country .	18.458055
work that might cost $500 to $750 in the south could cost $750 to $1 , 200 in new york city or chicago .	135.42497
an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1 , 000 .	60.06321
`` factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner ' ' , says dr . brodie .	45.634792
to become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist .	94.30058
`` costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher ' ' , says dr . brodie .	25.678177
`` fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago ' ' .	53.71567
people today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field .	43.86617
most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years .	52.670837
in many cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee .	124.61211
some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents .	138.10146
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .	88.65341
dr . brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children ' s births .	70.3505
`` in the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at	895.66925
now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent ' ' , he says .	91.29019
`` fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do ' ' .	43.277992
this knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment .	6.9354525
for example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another .	241.91177
in the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy ' s large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them .	119.01961
in other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment .	342.3952
the child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth .	599.2918
`` nature often takes care of the problem ' ' , says dr . brodie .	7.1642036
`` a child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity ' ' .	38.926823
that is why dr . brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist ' s advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early .	122.843094
`` both because of our culture ' s stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so .	172.76624
let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment ' ' , he urges .	135.88326
superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research .	165.01881
plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money .	53.52298
plaster of paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child .	194.7889
as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be .	77.97406
`` after your child ' s baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it ' s time for that first dental appointment ' ' , dr . brodie advises .	92.07505
`` then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year ' ' .	63.441563
to help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things	125.08711
he can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth .	65.19075
if a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed .	253.58362
in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them .	414.5747
from time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him ' ' , who were `` on the other side ' ' , and reports what they are saying .	50.082623
after a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames .	203.95166
as the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements .	175.55394
there are a few prognoses of coming events .	10.286854
another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading .	149.05324
some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual .	188.99898
not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums ' ' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased .	74.95456
in fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( esp ) , on this side of the `` veil ' ' .	64.41028
however that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons .	60.088013
perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans .	95.95511
they may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship .	125.129005
the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control ' ' who speaks through an entranced sensitive .	136.57338
what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation .	258.44507
but it is not really only a conversation .	18.080944
many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind .	143.89189
he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood	85.81839
it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! !	238.90707
most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious ' ' moods and to clarify them .	34.916515
however , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading .	86.657875
instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing .	256.92453
for this was to be a `` proxy sitting ' ' .	5.422912
as was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive .	122.924706
dr . karlis osis , director of research at the parapsychology foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` new research on survival after death ' ' , spring 1958 ) .	121.523994
he remarked `` it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter ' ' .	80.12396
the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium ' s esp may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated .	67.86166
one way to do this is by `` proxy sittings ' ' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .	88.733894
if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions .	176.88687
all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions .	176.20245
sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings ' ' are used .	23.189407
here the absent sitter makes a `` date ' ' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to `` come in ' ' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him .	66.11847
in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else .	84.33941
he gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator .	123.32448
as always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter .	38.544495
so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium ' s esp and the absent sitter ' s mind .	28.734041
it is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield esp can range .	422.32712
now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .	43.021477
here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic ' ' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual ' s own case .	101.95035
if you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! !	55.323795
an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit ' ' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ?	115.57393
it is , of course , easy to see how `` j ' ' will mean uncle jack to one person and little jane to another .	294.79517
`` a journey ' ' , `` a little white house ' ' , `` a change of outlook ' ' , can apply to many people .	43.50822
and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one ' s own point of view , which is by nature so personal .	76.76357
one sitter may think `` a leather couch ' ' identifies a reading as surely directed to him	266.03928
to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` atta boy ' ' ! !	56.546604
to get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him .	209.75517
if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame `` does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ?	165.916
or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience ' ' ? ?	138.39719
conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant	123.67793
`` he had four children , two sets of twins .	22.080652
after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry .	74.031876
part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road .	31.004175
he died of typhoid in 1921 ' ' .	1.7784424
methods have been developed of assigning `` weights ' ' to statements	60.813477
that is , it is known empirically that names beginning with r are more common than those beginning with z	447.42972
that in the united states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox .	435.31808
so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights .	145.36427
specific dates would be important , as would double names .	1765.2161
various categories have been explored to find out about these `` empirical probabilities ' ' against which to measure the readings .	111.869
in the parapsychology foundation ' s long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements .	108.73615
it is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself .	109.11526
or , on the other hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? ?	378.03564
that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out .	29.32779
so , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator ' s name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as correct ( hit ) , incorrect ( miss ) , doubtful , or especially significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) .	131.26851
he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his .	404.88303
all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the hits and significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter ' s own reading .	56.179344
that is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .	339.73618
conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material .	139.24553
and there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated .	94.632195
in another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements .	121.607414
does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ?	328.27536
does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? ?	260.40042
it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` hits ' ' .	137.62103
now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream ' ' , where the sensitive is at her best .	152.5848
mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses .	131.17885
`` i feel cold ' ' , the medium says , or `` my leg aches ' ' , `` my head is heavy ' ' .	84.93072
or perhaps she hears words or sounds `` there ' s such a noise of loud machinery ' ' , or `` i hear a child crying ' ' , or `` he says we ' re all here and glad to see you ' ' .	44.09417
maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door ' ' .	84.61917
the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions .	42.203964
sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there .	98.45618
if pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer .	149.21729
if asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them ' ' -- some more vividly than others .	89.87838
perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all .	37.156
even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another ' s personalities , moods , intentions .	128.2434
of course , there is an element of training here these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power .	173.25394
simply using it increases its intensity , i was told by one sensitive .	63.47721
nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery .	49.262714
impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .	365.21268
it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning .	121.55036
if communication with an entity on the `` other side ' ' is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism .	156.23177
during one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons .	69.8834
but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail	948.77997
taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement .	49.441315
in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained .	554.9649
though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols a slope to signify the name `` hill ' ' , for instance .	149.33543
one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter .	143.71431
the farmer ' s life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock .	60.465485
livestock must be tended every day , routinely .	235.291
a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .	84.4479
even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .	56.4346
the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily .	297.46478
he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice	142.16493
such a move may mean a loss of capital .	38.819214
hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life .	62.025635
the farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night .	152.65488
frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .	54.228764
no matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up .	203.02869
it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .	124.18336
drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops .	150.94606
sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner ' s earnings , even into his capital .	108.151825
returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year .	210.75203
the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis .	134.17227
land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .	102.290535
part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .	235.67917
if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high .	109.8292
a part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .	76.579636
it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .	110.48136
he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn .	54.999268
there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job .	187.37874
the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost .	74.2184
this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .	22.95155
if the farm is rented , the rent must be paid .	21.172459
if it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of .	104.58958
a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children .	51.219887
it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air .	24.099392
the children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .	127.31113
caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work .	120.16572
part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs .	173.201
for some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income .	97.36236
it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health .	174.2391
generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city .	68.97487
the savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .	99.888725
usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more .	84.295265
where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same .	191.5225
a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .	36.96812
some persons consider the work on a farm recreational .	119.43668
for some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner .	65.65789
part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal .	71.04072
it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation .	36.13237
general requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below .	167.68912
specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .	68.846886
three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs .	63.445133
you could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .	225.12021
if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you ' ll need more land .	71.67209
in deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you ' ll need to bring in the income you expect .	79.532814
but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .	176.16315
the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .	441.51157
some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .	128.55762
sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .	53.63653
when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm .	88.30534
if you have a year-round , full-time job you can ' t expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help .	105.83804
as a rule , part-time farmers hire little help .	51.01721
in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .	63.31832
list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month .	19.668118
you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one .	69.89083
do not include all your spare time or all your family ' s spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work .	96.94279
if you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools .	134.0043
you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however .	84.195404
for larger plantings , you ' ll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .	52.91704
if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) .	157.27986
these tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing .	56.145042
cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer .	73.66095
if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises .	211.34154
you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .	179.23244
if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work .	101.54137
before you look for a farm you ' ll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake	155.27733
and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent .	46.52456
information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture .	103.94196
if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy .	112.190315
discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .	135.66042
choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .	131.94225
then if you change jobs you won ' t necessarily have to sell the farm .	45.38087
the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .	102.03736
obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .	26.470678
if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby .	294.4111
if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city .	48.43692
look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .	45.244118
there are slums in the country as well as in the city .	24.013988
a tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .	112.14362
check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them .	87.91419
find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality .	50.588085
if these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect .	308.07578
you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .	137.06941
you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water .	13.512872
if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled .	96.77947
a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden .	69.51671
pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble .	52.086086
the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses .	46.109264
is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ?	37.065838
if you can ' t tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist .	279.8319
soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones .	109.704636
small areas that aren ' t right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop .	212.148
will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? ?	118.719376
how much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? ?	72.38341
if the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements .	75.67995
the value of the farm to you will depend on --	190.88356
the value of the products you can raise on it .	63.363327
the possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision .	205.33252
decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town .	110.23467
take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work .	39.756737
next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm .	20.749813
to do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm .	214.04977
list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year .	41.83486
estimate the value of the produce at normal prices .	87.64263
the total is the probably gross income from farming .	62.126064
to find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming .	313.9142
include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment .	383.6283
also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family .	59.950756
it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it .	223.32657
otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor .	89.16235
to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .	99.485016
everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge .	157.91298
for almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .	79.08788
one who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers .	117.62935
the gruesome humor of the nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david -- nor the gratuitous sadism of ss officers .	112.15829
public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the german press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .	86.06575
and still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .	135.78564
most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant ' s department of jewish affairs .	75.92035
counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .	41.955185
would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client ' s chances ? ?	216.58727
those who feared `` emotionalism ' ' at the trial showed less understanding than dr . servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .	230.81621
interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the attorney general for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow .	140.74214
but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new york .	77.364746
in each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course in moscow the liquidation of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalin ' s dictatorship	75.10698
in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism , with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard .	45.49721
these trials were properly termed `` political cases ' ' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .	64.41255
but what could the eichmann trial initiate ? ?	1.0944284
of what new course could it mark the beginning ? ?	88.74857
the eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future .	48.97459
it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are jews .	118.67675
as such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message ' ' .	93.70509
`` it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial ' ' -- said ben gurion , `` and not the nazi regime alone -- but anti-semitism throughout history ' ' .	117.87443
how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism ? ?	113.25436
and if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove eichmann a `` fiend ' ' ? ?	84.83205
these questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution ' s case .	35.361286
it might be contended , of course , that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism .	96.91843
but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment .	98.113396
in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument .	83.23298
one who could be linked to anti-semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the ages .	154.38583
shout at eichmann though he might , the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism .	192.576
yes , he believed that the jews were `` enemies of the reich ' ' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic ' ' anti-semites	63.213276
but he believed in the jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .	123.87618
the real question was how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself .	55.486988
in regard to eichmann , it was to be found in the nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent .	156.05508
perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could , as eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer .	260.44238
not through fear of disobeying orders , as eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitler ' s victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` well , let ' s try it ' ' .	126.68224
at any rate , the substance of eichmann ' s testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the ss , and though the prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to that extent .	78.357666
but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it .	117.53851
if anti-semitism was on trial in jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of eichmann ' s department of jewish affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of jews by non-police and non-party anti-semites in germany , as well as in poland , czechoslovakia , hungary ? ?	83.2778
the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the german state , including the reich minister of the interior , the state secretary in charge of the four year plan , the reich minister of justice , the under secretary of foreign affairs .	89.755806
the measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .	57.2482
heydrich , in opening the conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by goering which authorized the final solution as `` a complement to ' ' previous `` solutions ' ' for eliminating the jews from german living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .	132.47159
in other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating in every phase of german life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .	155.64189
this , in fact , it turned out to be .	20.898525
since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling german industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of hitler ' s crimes	240.93349
whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .	106.82879
what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?	138.05602
not in eichmann ' s anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning of the trial .	163.26265
no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had conceived their anti-semitism as an `` innocent ' ' dislike of jews , as do others like them today .	129.48991
the final solution proved that the jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .	130.31116
ought not an edifying trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere ' ' anti-semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ?	139.42372
the prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-semitism ' ' among the germans which hitler `` stimulated and transformed ' ' .	48.695644
but if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmann ' s head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .	102.14504
nor did the trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .	123.040115
certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .	129.8111
eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .	93.68843
do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the jews in germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ?	99.10401
the career of eichmann made the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization fearful of being mistaken for a jew , he seeks protection in his nazi uniform	242.52032
clinging to the enemy-jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness	84.68279
once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .	111.90048
`` is this the type of citizen you desire ' ' ? ?	38.686996
but though this characterization in no way diminished eichmann ' s guilt , the prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it .	106.097824
finally , if the mission of the trial was to convict anti-semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the final solution was aided by native jew-haters -- i . e . , germany , poland , hungary , czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- denmark , holland , italy , bulgaria , france ? ?	78.01348
should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports ? ?	117.68163
wasn ' t this meaning of eichmann ' s experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ?	245.45338
as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage , the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .	83.371925
only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin .	286.21683
it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe .	112.52286
it is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable	351.89145
most of the information elicited in jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .	62.276707
in poughkeepsie , n . y . , , in 1952 , a roman catholic hospital presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff .	83.50896
three agreed , but four declined and were suspended .	52.89165
after a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 .	50.39718
the peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy .	129.36873
in new york city in 1958 , the city ' s commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a contraceptive device .	91.58585
he thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving protestants , jews and roman catholics that continued for two months , until the city ' s board of hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .	80.71727
a year later in albany , n . y . , a roman catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood association .	70.35956
immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man ' s right to freedom of religious belief and conscience .	56.644974
these incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .	100.25683
it has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies .	251.28673
it has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .	90.27164
where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .	131.57219
the time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .	71.634674
the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .	142.36885
instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .	61.829178
`` all too frequently ' ' , points out james o ' gara , managing editor of commonweal , `` catholics run roughshod over protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades ' ' .	96.522675
all too often our language is unduly harsh .	7.5684347
the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between catholics and non-catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning .	181.95288
instead of catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .	122.127335
family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring .	42.47922
pope pius 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications ' ' .	64.405945
this means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .	63.411263
these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics in family planning .	75.65981
the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons .	224.50917
the roman catholic church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning .	139.61732
catholics , protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used .	74.54197
the roman catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period .	102.67131
the church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author it involves no frustration of nature ' s laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .	136.42212
with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice .	122.02366
there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .	325.5606
the grounds for the church ' s position are scriptural ( old testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .	62.03729
the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .	122.65257
the roman catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end .	84.07047
this conclusion is based on two propositions that man by the use of his reason can ascertain god ' s purpose in the universe and that god makes known his purpose by certain `` given ' ' physical arrangements .	131.90143
thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .	83.33982
moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by god , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception .	89.10128
believing that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature , roman catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .	147.50319
let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable .	44.42065
but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .	69.69804
why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ?	82.464966
it is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others .	188.96536
it is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others .	224.36009
both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .	36.56399
consider what happened during world war 1 , , when the protestant churches united to push the prohibition law through congress .	250.40172
many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .	70.334404
with over four million american men away at war , protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public .	189.80937
with the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .	86.1362
the attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history .	73.361984
the so-called `` noble experiment ' ' came to an inglorious end .	118.370605
that tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .	161.35011
that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today .	92.90745
up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law .	108.97096
this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian countries .	45.14786
today , the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction .	510.33038
the various lambeth conferences , expressing the anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally .	127.41753
in 1920 , the lambeth conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race ' ' .	85.066864
denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the conference declared `` we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage .	118.65859
one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children	110.85445
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control ' ' .	42.80048
the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .	127.49034
in 1930 , the lambeth conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .	120.019005
in 1958 , the conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by god on parents everywhere .	138.47633
many other protestant denominations preceded the anglicans in such action .	59.86717
in march , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified artificial methods of birth control .	46.13302
`` as to the necessity ' ' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .	60.482815
there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right ' ' .	63.089695
since then , many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .	89.815956
what determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive in general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .	160.56956
this development is reflected in the action taken in february , 1961 , by the general board of the national council of churches , the largest protestant organization in the aj .	28.28088
the board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning .	98.52691
it called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives .	115.99368
the general board declared `` most of the protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .	149.16309
the general protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception ' ' .	133.7783
an action once universally condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .	67.008194
this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .	43.314125
repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control .	80.81463
for all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american people is clear , profound and far-reaching .	76.64383
to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment .	191.46115
this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .	82.95476
conscience and religion are concerned with private sin the civil law is concerned with public crimes .	130.03102
only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .	92.35497
among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself .	191.4292
on april 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , discovery , weighed anchor in st . katherine ' s pool , london , and floated down the thames toward the sea .	48.872856
she carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic waters of north america .	32.760803
seventeen months later , on september 6 , 1611 , an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery limping eastward outside galway bay .	83.666794
when she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation .	95.70716
the captain was gone , and the mate was gone .	65.77769
the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .	44.16719
what disaster struck the discovery during those seventeen months ? ?	18.84707
what happened to the fourteen missing men ? ?	1.0990081
these questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .	76.701004
for hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain ' s fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man ' s desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports .	92.99933
all told , they offered a highly confused picture .	274.28775
but since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .	98.1228
not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .	63.226154
historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .	59.53509
first , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma .	82.583534
second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on american towns and counties , on a great american river , and on half a million square miles of arctic seas .	88.88109
this is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine	99.98637
the sailing in the spring of 1610 was hudson ' s fourth in four years .	26.394424
each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from western europe to the far east .	143.56546
in 1607 and 1608 , the english muscovy company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole or across the top of russia .	90.235664
twice he had failed , and the muscovy company indicated it would not back him again .	215.22614
in 1609 , the dutch east india company hired hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the half moon , and supplied him with dutch sailors .	110.88384
this time he turned westward , to the middle atlantic coast of north america .	48.14019
his chief discovery was important -- the great north ( later , the hudson ) river -- but it produced no northwest passage .	318.28436
when the half moon put in at dartmouth , england , in the fall of 1609 , word of hudson ' s findings leaked out , and english interest in him revived .	116.62454
the government forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship .	35.974262
he thereupon went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .	188.0757
by springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of henry , prince of wales .	72.14239
he had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .	66.60306
the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .	8.871705
a century of exploration had established that a great land mass , north and south america , lay between europe and the indies .	78.41871
one by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .	345.23175
in fact , hudson ' s sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes .	123.44284
but there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .	47.4815
nearly twenty-five years before , captain john davis had noted , as he sailed near the arctic circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides ' ' .	105.90473
he named this opening , between baffin island and labrador , the `` furious overfall ' ' .	25.552114
( later , it was to be called hudson strait .	33.11867
in 1602 , george waymouth , in the same little discovery that hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .	214.6258
hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway .	217.66133
even hudson , experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the thames .	112.11198
on previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain .	180.54475
on the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .	124.356094
on the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic .	107.40079
worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .	104.53489
of only one could he be sure -- young john hudson , his second son .	168.03226
the mate , robert juet , who had kept the journal on the half moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity .	73.920135
philip staffe , the ship ' s carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .	80.475426
arnold lodley and michael perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against hudson in a crisis .	122.32491
but men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find .	170.99681
hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .	176.7373
it is believed that hudson was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was trained on company ships .	64.00116
he was a londoner , married , with three sons .	51.933834
( the common misconception that he was dutch and that his first name was hendrik stem from dutch documents of his third voyage .	71.848724
) in 1610 , hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession .	107.75767
hudson ' s first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the thames .	74.36736
there at the river ' s edge waited one henry greene , whom hudson listed as a `` clerk ' ' .	101.431076
greene was in actuality a young ruffian from kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores .	90.07497
he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had greene wait at gravesend , where the discovery picked him up .	132.34128
for the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of great britain , then turned westward .	100.70356
poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` lousie bay ' ' .	92.434494
the subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .	37.30553
with hudson looking on , his protege greene picked a fight with the ship ' s surgeon , edward wilson .	57.732292
the issue was settled on shore , greene winning and wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england .	278.9069
with difficulty , hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from iceland .	39.10164
early in june , the discovery passed `` desolation ' ' ( southern greenland ) and in mid-june entered the `` furious overfall ' ' .	39.414997
floating ice bore down from the north and west .	35.63085
turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet .	33.400955
the ship ' s compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north pole .	61.73861
as the bergs grew larger , hudson was forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay , an inlet of the great strait .	157.94249
after finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled .	91.044136
the trouble was at least partly juet ' s doing .	275.52942
for weeks he had been saying that hudson ' s idea of sailing through to java was absurd .	88.57427
the great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason .	255.61113
a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther .	201.80194
instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( sir francis drake lopped a man ' s head off under similar circumstances ) , hudson decided to be reasonable .	95.75468
he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew .	86.47506
patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives .	137.42758
when hudson had finished , the `` town meeting ' ' broke down into a general , wordy argument .	111.24577
one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in england .	53.915607
up spoke carpenter staffe , who said he wouldn ' t give ten pounds to be home .	51.32333
all through july the discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands .	57.963165
on august 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as hudson knew , seen by europeans .	188.5974
to starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds .	64.324585
to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2 , 000 feet .	66.93009
hudson named the capes digges and wolstenholme , for two of his backers .	156.68985
hudson pointed the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called hudson bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the pacific .	72.25889
after three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas .	76.20281
the great `` sea to the westwards ' ' was a dead end .	116.33894
this must have been hudson ' s blackest discovery .	29.195745
for he seemed to sense at once that before him was no south sea , but the solid bulk of the north american continent .	105.255394
this was the bitter end , and hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure .	124.9683
feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .	328.16785
north and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week .	249.66585
hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to england through the `` furious overfall ' ' was again filling with ice .	77.31353
the men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .	190.8803
once more , juet ' s complaints were the loudest .	90.57912
hudson ' s reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .	133.56357
juet demanded that hudson prove his charges in an open trial .	80.63506
hudson , presiding , heard juet ' s defense , then called for testimony from crew members .	178.28117
juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward .	93.088684
hands on bible , seaman lodley and carpenter staffe swore that juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins .	54.72083
cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .	16.935347
others added that juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .	114.2913
the new mate was robert bylot , talented but inexperienced .	369.26755
there were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves .	305.95404
the important result , however , was that juet and francis clemens , the deposed boatswain , became hudson ' s sworn enemies .	112.82863
as hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew ' s respect for him .	163.41235
once , after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather , hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed .	259.59766
just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .	152.75899
michael butt and adame moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .	48.496487
the anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but philip staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe .	42.6173
thomas douglas , fifth earl of selkirk , a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river of the north .	36.059593
since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the hudson ' s bay company , he purchased great blocks of the comany ' s stock with the view to controlling its policies .	80.391205
having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116 , 000 square miles in the valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers .	26.917313
the grant , which stretched southward to lake traverse -- the headwaters of the red -- was made in may , 1811 , and by october of that year a small group of scots was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay .	98.87664
thus at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle of tippecanoe , anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the north american continent to the west of the american agricultural frontier .	77.47428
seven hundred miles south of york factory , at `` the forks ' ' of the red and the assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in august 1812 .	95.83283
by october the little colony about fort douglas ( present-day winnipeg ) numbered 100 .	72.59492
within a few years the scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called meurons .	77.85547
the latter , members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the war of 1812 , had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .	45.481266
selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .	75.44682
the mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 .	151.22203
it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .	128.37793
when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the scots , swiss and metis moved up the red to the mouth of the pembina river .	60.69748
here they built huts and a stockade named fort daer after selkirk ' s barony in scotland .	49.201828
the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .	123.64201
the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by british fur traders .	88.2226
for many years the northwest company had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi river , some 300 miles southeast of present-day st . paul , minnesota .	73.55323
when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm out of the united states , its british-born employees , now become american citizens -- joseph rolette , joseph renville and alexis bailly -- continued in the fur business .	141.40764
on big stone lake near the headwaters of the red river , robert dickson , superintendent of the western indian department of canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .	78.103966
his trading goods came from canada to the forks of red river and from selkirk ' s settlement he brought them south in carts .	155.04709
these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk colony was begun .	187.3983
in 1802 henry referred to `` our new carts ' ' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack .	71.17228
they were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .	98.04475
it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states .	43.23651
in september 1817 at fort daer ( pembina ) dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of sioux , he escorted to prairie du chien .	60.00461
during the trip selkirk decided that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern united states was the best route for goods from england to reach red river and that the united states was a better source of supply for many goods than either canada or england .	86.4174
upon arriving at baltimore , selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams , secretary of state at washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` missouri and illinois territories ' ' .	146.32362
this traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our settlements .	220.09583
the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .	185.56078
in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the forks ' ' ( fort douglas ) and in december 1819 , twenty men left fort daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien .	51.11583
it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on mackinac boats .	78.83039
with these completed and ice gone from the st . peter ' s river ( present-day minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to big stone lake , across into lake traverse , and down the red .	81.99355
this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk ab1 , 040 .	217.9093
nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to fort daer for food .	48.866528
thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .	128.18501
activity by british traders and the presence of a colony on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of prairie du chien , until then the most advanced united states post .	114.18132
in september 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the st . peter ' s river , the head of navigation on the mississippi , and began construction of fort st . anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , colonel josiah snelling .	65.832794
it was from the american outposts that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good .	43.97802
hercules l . dousman , fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien , contracted to supply selkirk ' s people with some 300 head of cattle , and alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers .	62.079338
bailly , after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the hudson ' s bay company ' s post on lake traverse `` in the sieux country ' ' and reached fort garry , as the selkirk hudson ' s bay company center was now called , late in the fall .	77.327126
he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward the united states .	88.184364
observing their distressing condition , colonel snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation .	25.660196
as these swiss were moving from the selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota , dousman of michilimackinac , michigan , and prairie du chien was traveling to red river to open a trade in merchandise .	64.28454
early in 1822 he was at fort garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco .	99.84786
alexander mcdonnell , governor of red river , and james bird , a chief factor of the hudson ' s bay company , ordered such `` sundry articles ' ' to a value of ab4 , 500 .	50.47591
for its part the hudson ' s bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement .	44.054546
as the time drew near for the drawing of the british-american frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the pembina colony -- its own post and fort daer -- was on american territory .	133.84836
accordingly selkirk ' s agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by october , john halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to `` the forks ' ' in rafts .	146.93605
`` i have done everything ' ' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment .	61.214622
' ' despite company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village .	125.70712
they would attempt to bring supplies from st . louis or prairie du chien at `` great expense as well as danger ' ' .	39.57655
at fort garry some of the swiss also decided to cast their lot with the united states , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to fort snelling .	106.87281
the disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave .	28.865925
after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on october 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick .	87.50608
in april came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-june .	423.22766
on june 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the mississippi .	96.87311
by fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about fort snelling , but most of them were sent on to galena and st . louis , with a few going as far as vevay , indiana , a notable swiss center in the united states .	61.282726
in 1837 , 157 red river people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at fort snelling .	111.773506
below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the mississippi river .	70.94864
at the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by father lucian galtier in 1840 .	133.58199
its people , including pierre bottineau and other american fur company employees and the refugees from fort garry , were joined by the remaining scots and swiss from fort snelling when major joseph plympton expelled them from the reservation in may 1840 .	145.53572
the resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father galtier ' s mission , st . paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers who remained at red river .	80.960846
while population at fort garry increased rapidly , from 2 , 417 in 1831 to 4 , 369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .	186.71169
accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the hudson ' s bay company , some settlers went into trade .	80.46196
the company maintained a store at which products of england could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs .	111.63731
despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the fort garry merchants were trading with the indians for furs .	40.902893
in june 1845 , the governor and council of assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via hudson ' s bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the company ' s trade and power ' ' .	85.78672
to reduce further the flow of goods from england , the company ' s local officials asked that its london authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men .	220.72537
with their customary source of supply cut off , the fort garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the mississippi country .	88.068344
others carried pemmican from `` the forks ' ' to st . paul and goods from st . paul to red river , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the british settlement .	75.13176
this trade was subject to a tariff of 7 . 5 per cent after february 1835 , but much was smuggled into assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the london committee .	98.94366
the trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel .	192.24855
the letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .	139.39168
indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of american literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray .	51.089462
some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive .	104.24598
a confederate observed that the yankees were `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier ' ' .	34.823784
another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house ' ' .	93.764275
a third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide ' ' .	74.24487
one wrote `` ( i am so hungry ) i could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups ' ' .	68.8634
a second reported that the dilapidated houses in virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times ' ' .	230.09424
a third remarked of slowness of southerners `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god ' ' .	118.57635
still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget ' ' .	182.11528
a yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart `` my girl is none of your one-horse girls .	259.34256
she is a regular stub and twister , double geered .	128.78235
she is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and union from the muzzle to the crupper ' ' .	61.768852
a texan wrote to a male companion at home `` what has become of halda and laura ? ?	107.50234
when you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now , but love by god ' ' .	73.7703
william r . stillwell , an admirable georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the georgia department of archives and history , liked to tease his wife in his letters .	139.38164
after he had been away from home about a year he wrote `` ( dear wife ) if i did not write and receive letters from you i believe that i would forgit that i was married .	130.94717
i don ' t feel much like a maryed man but i never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if i should you must forgive me as i am so forgitful ' ' .	168.18199
a yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote `` i am growing so fat i am a burden 2 myself ' ' .	147.73152
another yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer `` now i lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o ' er my body creep	364.4041
if they should bite before i wake , i pray the lord their jaws to break ' ' .	48.014183
charles thiot , a splendid georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .	44.27567
but he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine .	62.523224
near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` fall-in ' ' and the other `` close-up ' ' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of fall-in and close-up ' ' .	63.111057
the soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the civil war armies were an earthy people .	125.3456
they talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body .	20.803875
one of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea .	85.18299
men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels ' '	101.16989
but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts ' ' .	17.53205
a michigan soldier stationed in georgia wrote in 1864	1577.8842
`` i expect to be tough as a knott as soon as i get over the georgia shitts ' ' .	109.92299
johnny rebs from the deep south who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the virginia quickstep ' ' .	143.8174
a georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea `` i have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days .	152.6564
it sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me ' ' .	49.728317
a michigan soldier wrote his brother `` i am well at present with the exception i have got the dyerear and i hope thease few lines find you the same ' ' .	177.61601
the letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .	46.478516
save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .	285.86685
most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee .	109.40482
in the south , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .	89.91233
scarcity of paper caused many southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing , i . e . , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written .	115.72127
sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .	40.237732
a yank writing from vicksburg , may 28 , 1863 , stated `` not less than 50 balls have passed over me since i commenced writing .	166.03004
i could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now ' ' .	54.27757
a reb stationed near petersburg informed his mother `` i need not tell you that i dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter .	129.6042
just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for i don ' t dodge every time ' ' .	69.50932
another reb writing under similar circumstances before atlanta reported `` the yankees keep shooting so i am afraid they will knock over my ink , so i will close ' ' .	185.55751
the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives .	97.505974
but fathers often addressed communications to their small children	177.43732
and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of civil war letters .	156.9116
rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the negro community .	42.65972
early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp negro `` body servants ' ' to perform the menial chores such as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes .	130.36417
sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners ' families .	48.68487
unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .	7.7087536
owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century america , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling .	130.783
occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in richmond , petersburg , washington , or nashville .	75.09824
an alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the virginia belles `` they thout i was a saint .	179.97615
i told them some sweet lies and they believed it all .	108.96894
i would tell them i got a letter from home stating that five of my negroes had runaway and ten of pappy ' s .	137.12517
but i wold say i recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk ' ' .	115.331635
an ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus `` dear sis .	242.6096
alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse .	361.50607
i think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as alf dyer and let that orney thefin , drunkard , damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you , the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion , he is too orney for hel .	450.94473
i will shute him as shore as i sea him ' ' .	23.480518
initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions .	98.28164
a federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in virginia `` dear pa .	47.154583
we got to one house where there were five secessionists .	1048.631
they brok & run and arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them .	116.37784
thay may say what they please but godamit pa it is fun ' ' .	150.74394
some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers .	51.98811
a mississippi soldier wrote `` our general reub davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass ' ' .	36.058804
an alabamian wrote `` col . henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn ' ' .	102.415184
a floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear ' ' .	58.73312
on december 9 , 1862 , sergeant edwin h . fay , an unusual louisianan who held a . b . and m . a . degrees from harvard university and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in louisiana , wrote his wife `` i saw pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke i ever saw .	100.38464
his head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps .	153.88283
jackson runs first and his cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader .	239.6591
but he is a west point graduate and therefore must be born to command ' ' .	52.89188
similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of northern soldiers .	50.947098
a massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a civil war version of bill mauldin , wrote `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks .	102.70363
they get all the glory and most of the pay and don ' t earn ten cents apiece on the average , the drunken rascals ' ' .	67.67513
private george gray hunter of pennsylvania wrote `` i am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago ' ' .	92.90089
another yankee became so disgusted as to state `` i wish to god one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ) ' ' .	121.334305
no group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors .	200.94168
one federal soldier wrote `` the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do ( c ) ters and offersey when this war is over ' ' .	259.82294
shortly after the beginning of sherman ' s georgia campaign , an ailing yank wrote his homefolk `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment .	165.10713
i insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that i had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) union quackery ' ' .	209.67049
the attitudes which the rebs and yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred .	153.99236
the rebs were , to a massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame ' ' .	193.70796
a pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever i saw .	180.20638
they looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings .	42.294872
' ' private jenkins lloyd jones of the wisconsin light artillery wrote in his diary `` i strolled among the alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity i think in the universe , their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect .	141.5128
they recooned as how you ' uns all would be a heap wus to we ' uns all ' ' ' .	69.791016
in a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , thomas taylor , a private in the 6th alabama volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated `` you know that my heart is with you but i never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe , by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is booty .	122.38838
the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america .	36.663486
and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world .	68.64368
thus , if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset .	55.08354
historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .	76.204994
1 ) every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .	185.39345
what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred .	214.04956
2 ) as a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness .	110.520515
its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .	104.37743
one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years .	52.70987
the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american war , the steady currency of the lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point .	91.487335
nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of american life , that learned societies such as the american folklore society and the american historical association were founded in the 1880s , or that courses in american literature , american civilization , american anything have swept our school and college curricula .	140.14058
of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century united states .	80.97231
yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .	72.54225
it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .	82.50654
after all , the average american as he lies and waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen ' s comprehension and control .	103.452095
anyone ' s identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .	182.31651
such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes .	404.9562
in america , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .	1197.2634
a heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land .	146.12315
but we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .	280.55673
parson weems ' s george washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting states .	80.149185
abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national constitution .	194.84778
robert e . lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .	52.254993
and their roles are paralleled by those of patrick henry , nathan hale , andrew jackson , davy crockett , theodore roosevelt and many , many more .	115.45688
therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts .	103.39755
1 ) most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all .	124.05127
2 ) the concept that an `` american national folklore ' ' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend .	138.78047
folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission .	158.9341
it has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .	53.29018
related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence .	215.86163
though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .	158.79395
in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .	90.845566
enthusiastically , americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like paul bunyan tales , abe lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition .	92.570175
nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .	221.53085
naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore .	98.83874
that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .	150.9125
as long as his material is americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic ' ' to his audience , he remains satisfied .	119.916084
from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore .	81.1314
on the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation .	192.09212
on the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western ' ' or colonial material willy-nilly .	165.06415
unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used american folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .	155.63113
after all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates .	389.29535
in addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever-expanding and changing society .	170.97342
for that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed .	34.35126
anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .	100.03362
they have little `` esprit de corps ' ' .	2.0534663
the outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque .	160.66751
his love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he doesn ' t care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote .	66.80599
folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such .	227.42104
the amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field .	57.54696
he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream ' ' reasons that many persons hunt game	219.21402
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .	51.508247
fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don ' t distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .	81.1591
but there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century german scholarship .	318.84943
both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .	48.170532
both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines .	63.37632
the commercial propagandist , who can ' t afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst ' s toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .	132.24918
his standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst .	131.78241
to both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .	250.18378
dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector .	116.817566
the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .	63.496284
the work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience .	153.74663
publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material .	316.77313
the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in .	61.77822
as a result , most people don ' t have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is	100.67164
they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there .	124.12475
and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .	256.87527
if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american public .	152.3313
and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each .	104.86499
does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz ' ' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?	103.93636
when the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? ?	293.3029
is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was ? ?	306.455
or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? ?	180.8689
when he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged .	117.25855
in the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale .	129.44714
robert frost , for instance , writes about rural life in new england , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems .	94.37426
this has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet ' ' , simply because he is a rural one .	61.740025
in the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than frost to being `` folk writers ' ' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material .	117.98201
stephen vincent benet ' s john brown ' s body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does john steinbeck ' s the grapes of wrath and carl sandburg ' s the people , yes .	143.54514
the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass .	86.7124
folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .	171.09721
the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude .	176.95006
in fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don ' t care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits .	110.15559
nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days ' ' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .	88.00105
as part of the same arrangement , torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign , bestowed upon o ' banion a third share in the hawthorne smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade .	78.77981
o ' banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others ' .	95.05755
he had a round , frank irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone ' s body .	94.01046
he carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands .	95.357765
he killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately .	26.04173
the police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them .	64.174255
like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol .	29.12647
he was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths .	42.5061
he divided humanity into `` right guys ' ' and `` wrong guys ' ' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .	45.064335
he had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality ' ' .	20.547003
he walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns .	125.30096
landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly ' ' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath .	75.4786
he was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as torrio and capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the chicago underworld , the roughneck king .	141.01347
o ' banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant irish plasterer , in the north side ' s little hell , close by the sicilian quarter and death corner .	123.92439
he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral and also served as an acolyte to father o ' brien .	91.149956
the influence of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace	91.36174
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking .	236.78342
at the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .	93.82434
because of this he was known as gimpy ( but , as with capone and his nickname of scarface , never in his presence ) .	164.47983
in his teens o ' banion was enrolled in the vicious market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgovern ' s cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out .	103.71882
he then got a job with the chicago herald-examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper ' s news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors .	76.57274
he was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary , later committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor .	74.69685
o ' banion ' s first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to bridewell prison for three months for burglary	79.284424
two years later he served another three months for assault .	80.0524
those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .	128.98326
but by now o ' banion ' s political pull was beginning to be effective .	116.45605
on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10 , 000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed .	100.2803
on one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant john j . ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the postal telegraph building	125.50702
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30 , 000 in bribes , it was estimated .	56.498035
as promptly as torrio , o ' banion jumped into bootlegging .	139.0665
he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the sicilians , but he had his huge north side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money .	92.27349
unlike the sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .	61.21824
he was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 o ' banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state `` i always deliver my borough as per requirements ' ' .	161.91623
until 1924 o ' banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his north side domain solidly democratic .	695.05835
there was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time q . `` who ' ll carry the forty-second and forty-third wards ' ' ? ?	52.18189
a . o ' banion , in his pistol pocket ' ' .	10.3202095
but as november 1924 drew close the democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that o ' banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important republicans .	105.83305
to forestall any change of allegiance , the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o ' banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .	118.71439
the reception was held in a private dining room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west .	54.60179
it was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .	91.10494
the guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of american civic life at this time .	58.44773
it included the top o ' banion men and chief of detectives michael hughes .	152.12166
when mayor dever heard of the banquet he summoned hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers .	107.35138
hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of jerry o ' connor , the proprieter of a loop gambling house .	91.55668
`` but when i arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , i knew i had been framed , and withdrew almost at once ' ' .	98.200226
in fact , o ' connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin .	167.42674
there was a brief interruption while one of o ' banion ' s men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip .	94.89021
then o ' banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .	34.463745
this dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth ' ' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` belshazzar feasts ' ' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels ' ' .	81.706955
pasley continued `` they became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 ' ' .	77.982834
however , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .	265.17172
o ' banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better republican deal .	140.28238
on election day -- november 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes .	175.9359
the result was a landslide for the republican candidates .	42.69913
this further demonstration of o ' banion ' s ballooning power did not please torrio and capone .	155.97935
in the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .	84.739296
he behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .	105.35447
they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , yankee schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by dave miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with torrio and o ' banion , frank , a policeman , and max , the youngest .	105.64992
to settle this slight , o ' banion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop , where , he had learned , dave miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy .	68.68841
at the end of the performance , dave and max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .	145.91873
o ' banion drew his guns and fired at dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .	146.80263
a second bullet ricocheted off max ' s belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .	94.89989
o ' banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre	53.4539
that sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of torrio and capone , was a nonsense .	55.629517
a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street and demanded $300 to let it through .	174.99164
one of the beer-runners telephoned o ' banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation .	103.10004
o ' banion ' s reaction was `` three hundred dollars ! !	135.86272
why , i can get them knocked off for half that much ' ' .	72.93752
upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if o ' banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen .	132.5978
but in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned torrio and returned to o ' banion with the message `` say , dionie , i just been talking to johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred .	120.34514
he says he don ' t want no trouble ' ' .	16.571476
but torrio and capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman .	96.67141
for three years , since the liquor territorial conference , torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated o ' banion ' s impudent double-crossing .	75.840454
they had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in cicero .	86.64061
when , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election , torrio had given o ' banion a slice of cicero , the profits from that district had been $20 , 000 a month .	111.06191
in six months o ' banion had boosted the profits to $100 , 000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb .	132.39587
these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the sheldon , saltis-mcerlane , and druggan-lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the torrio-capone saloons	142.86412
once again o ' banion ' s brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .	90.38401
the revenue from o ' banion ' s cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the torrio-capone takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago ' s south and west sides .	259.33734
but he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate .	23.107136
at last , even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that o ' banion should take a percentage in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer concession .	91.223526
o ' banion ' s reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .	83.42081
still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the o ' banion gang ' s seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of canadian whisky worth $100 , 000 and by one of the biggest coups of the prohibition era -- the sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .	72.575745
here was stored $1 , 000 , 000 worth of bonded whisky .	75.373695
these 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the o ' banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water .	73.2938
a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption .	53.191326
the most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883	40.542767
it raced across the pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of java and sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as san francisco .	83.39646
the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves .	70.14289
whether or not plato ' s tale of the lost continent of atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times .	113.04771
indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the arabian sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the biblical story of the flood .	83.63325
one of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november 1 , 1755	149.93579
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the english coast .	116.246284
tsunami are rare , however , in the atlantic ocean	273.49655
they are far more common in the pacific .	10.9733715
japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 .	93.75193
the hawaiian islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years .	161.5583
in 1707 an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the inland sea	207.32243
one wave swamped more than 1 , 000 ships and boats in osaka bay .	59.131138
a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been .	324.2747
in 1896 a japanese tsunami killed 27 , 000 people and swept away 10 , 000 homes .	120.42241
the dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .	34.89721
an ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the atlantic or 1 , 000 feet in the pacific .	55.642597
but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest .	63.72131
while a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .	58.5811
the greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave	156.80579
lagrange ' s law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity .	155.89607
in the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour .	113.37771
tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .	196.91338
their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest .	40.91513
usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights .	78.832794
on the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells .	226.56337
not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .	41.55192
the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .	123.101685
the giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .	154.47862
they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .	118.50648
generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .	133.04425
this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .	93.66314
reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish .	57.939762
at hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach .	68.549835
many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore .	36.08829
after an earthquake in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground .	168.5452
when a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides .	53.80266
just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them .	121.409775
a tsunami is not a single wave but a series .	168.40315
the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .	121.419846
the waves may keep coming for many hours .	7.050775
usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest .	216.33603
among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at hilo was francis p . shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography , one of the world ' s foremost marine geologists .	67.92025
he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves .	12.344772
their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling .	53.470943
the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .	146.18694
on some of the islands ' beaches the waves came in gently	53.490604
they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come .	133.54153
in hilo bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .	45.0658
the highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at pololu valley .	151.04376
scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon .	14.470602
during a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night .	63.904243
the luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea .	109.97384
japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs	149.40787
the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance .	179.57599
the waves of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3 , 000 feet .	132.04767
gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .	31.200682
the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by commander c . k . green of the coast and geodetic survey staff .	98.44045
it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface .	165.3927
but when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit .	87.95683
this in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress .	82.676125
such equipment has been installed at hilo , midway , attu and dutch harbor .	87.57951
the moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .	69.92803
this center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with seismographs .	110.62306
its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami .	97.909676
by means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific .	84.589035
the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps .	123.52546
all of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .	231.44795
since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the pacific , but only one was of any consequence .	87.28092
on november 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula .	116.351814
at 17 07 that afternoon ( greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in honolulu .	194.91275
within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in alaska , arizona and california , the quake ' s epicenter was placed at 51 degrees north latitude and 158 degrees east longitude .	114.27627
while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific ( midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at 23 30 greenwich time .	179.3181
it turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 .	116.53688
they hurled a cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .	175.92424
but not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the hawaiian islands did not exceed $800 , 000 .	54.64451
there is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .	339.99466
but it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough .	66.07857
in the vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves .	132.61937
the key to the world of geology is change	19322.809
life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .	123.34788
the land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .	93.81118
earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break .	214.92134
sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface	76.2281
often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there	63.527294
and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried .	711.03107
today ' s earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth ' s restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them .	104.602
the effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .	201.1339
the role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster .	149.2807
superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .	336.68286
we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth ' s interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .	117.005714
these waves have shown that 1 , 800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core .	83.369225
earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths .	83.39535
two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .	10.167009
( 1 ) as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .	153.97194
( 2 ) if earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ?	144.70354
knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields .	53.382412
in the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources .	124.213684
we have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate .	177.51764
the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book causes of catastrophe by l . don leet .	203.68031
at twelve minutes after five on the morning of wednesday , april 18 , 1906 , san francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .	84.20652
a sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll .	172.99664
in ireland ' s county limerick , near the river shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen , which means `` garden of owen ' ' .	49.737362
undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on american military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name .	97.709175
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes , sioux and apaches , mexican banditos under pancho villa , japanese in the south pacific , and chinese and north korean communists in korea .	76.3246
garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u . s . cavalry regiment , `` the fighting seventh ' ' .	18.483276
today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .	82.11864
but don ' t tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh , especially in a saloon on saturday night .	38.85766
of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than lieutenant colonel melbourne c . chandler .	121.3195
wiry and burr-headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper .	87.52987
the truth is , however , that when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil .	156.14343
chandler had been commissioned in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it .	92.53513
though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces .	87.73893
the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of troop h , 7th cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan .	60.31313
outside of combat , he couldn ' t have landed in a tougher spot .	41.901737
first of all , no unit likes to have a new co brought in from the outside , especially when he ' s an armchair trooper .	71.814095
second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it ' s on maneuvers .	116.260025
in combat , helping your co make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed .	246.10947
but in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it ' s easy .	59.98138
but his first few days with troop h were full of surprises , beginning with first sergeant robert early .	476.9016
chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .	116.93934
instead sergeant early was quiet , sharp and confident .	62.710495
he had enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade .	183.73697
there was no weapon early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .	630.5334
he could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .	116.11798
further , he had taken full advantage of the army ' s correspondence courses .	131.66885
he not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .	75.48868
but for all his erudite confidence , sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold .	216.16342
he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh .	13.935675
sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army .	53.34502
he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment .	35.433094
for example , it was a battalion of the 7th cavalry under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the battle of the little big horn .	37.075302
it didn ' t take captain chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of troop aj .	78.77298
but what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment .	93.8234
maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in tokyo , captain chandler still with them .	116.256424
it was the 7th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial palace of the emperor .	54.678055
but still mel chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word , `` garryowen ' ' .	48.827282
it happened at the st . patrick ' s day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an irish march .	157.47827
in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .	128.87364
the faces belonged to lieutenant marvin goulding , his wife and their two children .	85.58843
and when the singing began , it was the gouldings who sang the old irish songs the best .	118.69599
though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about marvin goulding , the jewish officer from chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange .	128.09146
for marvin goulding , like giovanni martini , the bugler boy who carried custer ' s last message , or margarito lopez , the one-man army on leyte , was a garryowen , through and through .	107.24276
it was no coincidence that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment .	31.837996
and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen .	8.7418995
he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment .	58.79241
one of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop .	165.14084
even the mess sergeant , bill brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range .	97.550804
the troop received a new leader , lieutenant robert m . carroll , fresh out of rotc and bucking for regular army status .	142.4939
carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that ra berth , and he wanted to play it cool .	121.045135
so mel chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before .	120.08874
when the korean war began , on june 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of leyte during world war 2 , , the 7th cavalry was not in the best fighting condition .	59.90029
its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world war 2 .	216.22961
just a month after the korean war broke out , the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat .	43.75908
from then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in korea .	64.1674
one night on the naktong river , mel chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps .	41.011166
the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .	42.527042
the troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn ' t know when , and they didn ' t know where .	28.730097
at 6 o ' clock on the morning of august 12 , they were in doubt no longer .	53.131893
the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with russian machine guns , attacked the position held by chandler ' s men .	117.02652
first came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram .	159.69177
they were followed by crack north korean troops , who mounted one charge after another .	123.46015
they overran the 7th cav ' s forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead .	265.6397
another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .	60.12189
captain chandler saw that it was building up strength .	1429.3623
he assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .	92.27165
one of the more seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll , the young officer bucking for the regular army .	135.44835
chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .	87.68263
he took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run .	46.921394
the first thing he knew the words `` garryowen ' ' ! !	7.481298
his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran .	185.22476
the koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire .	49.698032
chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran .	106.054016
it was bob carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of garryowen .	43.072178
he had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge .	90.54517
because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again .	75.00601
but an enemy grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .	77.829666
he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire .	93.67842
enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .	82.94317
they found it at the junction between troops h and g , and prepared to counterattack .	49.157528
`` okay , men ' ' , he said .	6.687764
goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` garryowen ' ' ! !	18.444782
but the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding fell dead .	68.089516
for an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead .	114.02452
then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` garryowen ' ' ! !	40.559605
they charged into the enemy like wild men .	3.668585
that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll had begun .	71.682205
goulding ' s platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack .	118.29104
reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by goulding ' s platoon .	52.65507
the north koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies .	91.16952
artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .	92.83677
though bob carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived .	100.94742
today he is a major -- in the regular army .	209.31696
so filled was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment .	67.682526
after years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , of garryowen and glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit .	141.175
the battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off .	62.807602
for nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment .	67.16622
take the case of major marcus a . reno , who survived the battle of the little big horn in 1876 .	65.7132
from the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus reno .	126.91896
many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him .	29.863007
but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him .	116.59819
he was a member of the fighting seventh .	70.66873
although it was at the battle of the little horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in american history , that the 7th cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then .	142.57198
brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment ' s first permanent commander and , like such generals as george s . patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military prominence , custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare .	154.80537
during the civil war , custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 .	137.60274
he finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the u . s . army .	60.016773
i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them .	59.523994
if they were , walter lippmann would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky , and herb lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about .	235.49236
i do mean , however , that i take them for granted , and that everything i shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions .	200.20305
the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity	74.29105
and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states .	44.575596
i speak of `` the largest possible measure ' ' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around .	125.07417
these conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense i have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world communism .	372.32367
this is true for two reasons because communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions	80.248344
and because communists have the will and , as long as soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .	61.245865
moreover , as communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote .	113.01245
it follows that victory over communism is the dominant , proximate goal of american policy .	60.068336
proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive ' ' ends we seek , to which victory over communism is but a means .	153.84152
but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .	146.30939
but if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin , then we must fight .	175.0807
freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective	33.59208
but if granting self-determination to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the sino-soviet orbit , then algerian freedom must be postponed .	169.94432
but if justice for bantus entails driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west , then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer .	57.898773
but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made .	163.77892
it may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism	91.31649
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of soviet communist power .	73.76981
this much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .	89.58135
this brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .	122.42428
i submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .	87.20554
and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of american policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously .	125.8177
in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .	91.25855
the other , for the most part , true .	373.30338
the first was that america had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .	107.58613
i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .	80.43104
you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- i certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all american strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of u . s . -soviet relations for the foreseeable future .	139.3518
i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts , and i think mr . jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth .	209.31027
suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the soviets ' position `` there would be more than 2 , 000 modern soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in mexico and the caribbean .	125.35612
overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast .	50.936565
half of the population of the u . s . would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people ' ' .	42.62819
add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .	154.97589
add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength .	149.52397
if we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of khrushchev ' s nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .	55.092266
the other charge was that america ' s political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .	38.83295
the contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it .	129.88873
the argument was typically advanced in terms of u . s . `` prestige ' ' .	18.205004
prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem	36.246918
and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .	49.41798
prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill .	166.10344
but contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .	46.062946
only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .	136.74951
the thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it .	119.04209
the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .	61.294888
this ignorant estimate , i repeat , is not of any interest in itself	126.735054
but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side .	121.51606
to the extent , then , that declining u . s . prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .	99.520744
still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves .	67.8724
here i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? ?	156.69359
and is western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ?	42.060787
in answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded the success of communism ' s war against the west does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .	181.37457
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence .	87.03692
communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages .	216.6413
fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they could not win , the communists seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the united nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level .	112.47587
the soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against the west .	204.9742
thus , typically , the first stage of a communist takeover is to `` neutralize ' ' a country .	131.64775
the second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist ' ' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy .	60.35994
and this may be as far as the process will go .	87.05797
the kremlin ' s goal is the isolation and capture , not of ghana , but of the united states -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist ' ' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the soviet foreign office .	128.9019
to recite the particulars of recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring .	301.9235
six years ago french indochina , though in troubie , was in the western camp .	89.843544
cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist .	189.26178
indonesia , in the early days of the republic , leaned toward the west .	35.54342
today sukarno ' s government is heavily besieged by avowed communists , and for all of its `` neutralist ' ' pretensions , it is a firm ally of soviet policy .	50.43645
ceylon has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west .	113.72191
in the middle east , iraq , syria and egypt were , a short while ago , in the western camp .	168.98514
today the nasser and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west , are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel	112.26118
in almost every particular follow the kremlin ' s foreign policy line .	40.057808
a short time ago all africa was a western preserve .	354.7077
never mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west .	99.71526
today , africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging , it would seem , into the soviet orbit .	66.20008
latin america was once an area as `` safe ' ' for the west as nebraska was for nixon .	65.532875
one latin american country , cuba , has become a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast .	54.206882
in some countries the trend has gone further than others mexico , panama , and venezuela are displaying open sympathy for castroism , and there is no country -- save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where castroism and anti-americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause .	175.17514
only in europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface .	92.34581
the strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in england , and even in germany .	80.14743
what have we to show by way of counter-successes ? ?	87.95675
we have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron curtain .	111.88682
there was the hungarian revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .	289.07812
there was the polish revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests .	261.6219
there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended did not exist .	138.27046
only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing communist power in guatemala .	150.77974
and contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures ' ' and `` world opinion ' ' to bring down that communist government	103.30594
we moved decisively to effect an anti-communist coup d ' etat .	88.94994
we served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery .	365.0986
the first rattle of the machine guns , at 7 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear .	148.23438
`` sounds exactly like last time ' ' .	2.15919
the young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven .	129.99568
the middle-aged man said over and over , `` why did i come here , why did i come here ' ' .	95.978806
amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , i heard the thumping of mortars .	186.96675
this was my second day in vientiane , the administrative capital of laos , and my thoughts were none too brave .	243.14641
better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick .	211.3204
chinese and indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters .	39.152405
hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby .	5.3262634
a woman with a small boy slipped in between them .	91.46024
`` please ' ' , she said , `` please ' ' .	14.198424
she held out her hand to show that she had money .	112.89988
the american newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office .	472.10855
had the communist-led pathet lao finally come this far ? ?	30.143137
or was it another revolt inside vientiane ? ?	1.2294625
`` let ' s play hero ' ' , i said .	22.056034
`` let ' s go to the roof and see ' ' .	15.200897
there had been an eclipse of the moon .	25.92698
a traditional lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms .	103.735886
the din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around .	184.57303
how quaint it all seemed the next day .	11.844685
a restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks ' ' .	118.638336
but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later .	106.11051
and no wonder , for vientiane , the old city of sandalwood , had become the city of bullet holes .	136.91125
i saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets .	131.82993
along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered .	48.258183
in place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble .	114.566574
mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door .	117.28495
what had been the ambassador ' s suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick .	35.76294
this damage had been done in the battle of vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( december 9-11 , 1960 ) .	126.62475
and now , in march , all laos suffered a state of siege .	224.00754
the pathet lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .	127.010315
throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .	69.01514
`` and it ' s all the more tragic because it ' s so little deserved ' ' , said mr . j . j . a . frans , a belgian official of the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization .	61.99018
we talked after i hailed his jeep marked with the u . n . flag .	29.105116
practically all the people of laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows .	145.2737
they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls .	96.72752
nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .	134.6341
they spread over an area no larger than oregon	676.70654
yet they include peoples as different from one another as oregonians are from patagonians .	201.92458
faith in the buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits	104.46229
and to live in harmony with nature ' ' .	1.8205855
`` precisely ' ' , said mr . frans .	344.10892
he spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest .	45.29991
the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering mekong river .	24.998684
shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside .	72.304276
for so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast .	86.20535
to many a frenchman -- they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti .	148.57085
yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe .	107.99949
the pathet lao , stiffened by communist veterans from neighboring north viet nam , were supplied by soviet aircraft .	33.817944
the royal lao army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with american funds .	90.744736
in six years , u . s . aid had amounted to more than $1 . 60 for each american -- a total of three hundred million dollars .	72.958145
we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened to ignite another war among the world ' s giants .	50.77988
even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ? ?	201.36133
to find out , we traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the royal lao army from attopeu , the city of buffalo dung in the southeast , to muong sing , the city of lions in the northwest , close to communist china ( map , page 250 ) .	109.20348
we rode over roads so rough that our jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .	169.8791
we flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn ' t crash .	50.833202
in the end we ran into communist artillery fire .	13.364739
`` we ' ' were bill garrett of the national geographic illustrations staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met	395.11618
boun my -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in savannakhet , the border of paradise .	78.77489
he had attended three universities in the united states .	4.190237
but he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of vientiane , including the royal capital , luang prabang .	71.92156
before the airplanes came , he said , travel in laos was just about impossible .	376.56183
alas , so it almost proved for us , too .	46.445297
to go outside the few cities required permits .	15.969767
and getting them seemed a life ' s work .	45.096024
nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts .	102.712
we were told that to the pathet lao , a kidnaped american was worth at least $750 , a fortune in laos .	235.98201
everyone had heard of the american contractor who had spurned an escort .	129.08029
now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil american intervention .	190.8802
although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in french , we were getting nowhere .	117.74225
we had nearly decided that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the prime minister .	53.494225
could we be ready in 15 minutes ? ?	1.4023337
his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off .	21.51697
and so , after a flight southeast to savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun oum of champassak , a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from texas .	118.50676
from his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a luger .	74.002235
with our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust .	67.317406
in keng kok , the city of silkworms , the prime minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .	39.658356
then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls .	119.81007
an hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary .	82.94598
more bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well .	212.75887
then off again , rushing to keep up .	16.37572
but our two jeep mates -- keo viphakone from luang prabang and john cool from beaver , pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust .	176.50957
together they had probably done more than any other men to help push laos toward the 20th century -- constructively .	161.65501
mr . keo , once a diplomat in paris and washington , was commissioner of rural affairs .	130.85007
john , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the london school of economics , headed the rural development division of usom , the united states operations mission administering u . s . aid .	55.210533
`` what you see are self-help projects ' ' , john said .	87.715675
`` we ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor .	44.27875
we send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs .	50.167953
that way they have an infirmary for $400 .	3.1374516
we have 2 , 500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools .	81.27613
`` our people have been used to accepting things as they found them ' ' , he said .	23.204628
`` where there was no road , they lived without one .	76.41345
now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence .	103.29849
that ' s a big step toward a modern state .	133.96509
you might say we are in the nation-building business ' ' .	37.36607
in the villages people lined up to give us flowers .	230.8532
then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine .	60.145775
the prime minister paid his respects to the buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech .	83.092094
the soldiers are fighting and the americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself .	92.63544
but our stumping tour of the south wasn ' t all misery .	15.467933
crossing the 4 , 000-foot width of the mekong at champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze .	86.02644
briefly we rolled over a paved road up to pak song , on the cool bolovens plateau .	116.854774
the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood , supported by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song .	63.10793
in the village of soukhouma , which means `` peaceful ' ' , we had a baci .	47.31035
this is the most endearing of lao ceremonies .	7.5050087
it takes place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the new year , for any good purpose .	81.80064
the preparations were elaborate flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string .	38.265408
the strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) .	70.43536
the candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables .	287.52347
i was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone ' s head , where the worthiest spirits reside .	98.21422
now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us .	280.92743
a man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body .	48.402023
those souls like to wander off , and must be called back .	133.28548
with the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power .	172.72563
then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists .	135.09023
these were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls .	116.073906
as we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to john cool and silently showed him his hand .	104.9737
it had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .	14.971895
john said `` i have some antiseptic salve with me , but it ' s too late for that ' ' .	49.836452
my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds .	89.50633
jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings .	48.218784
`` being jewish gives you tremendous drive ' ' , a boy remarked .	17.540464
`` it means that you have to get ahead ' ' .	15.483688
when i pressed for a purely religious definition , i encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty .	83.873146
`` i like the tradition ' ' , a girl said .	100.24081
`` i like to follow the holidays when they come along .	91.58974
but you don ' t have to worship in the traditional way .	17.415617
as i see it , there ' s no real difference between being jewish , catholic , or protestant ' ' .	68.70898
another teen-ager remarked `` most jews don ' t believe in god , but they believe in people -- in helping people ' ' .	63.48221
still another boy asserted `` to be a good jew is to do no wrong	144.79424
it ' s to be a good person ' ' .	6.255528
when asked how this was different from being a good protestant , the boy answered , `` it ' s the same thing ' ' .	48.12392
this accords with the study by maier and spinrad .	40.166294
they discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this conviction .	61.839287
the most important aims of the jewish students were as follows to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent	129.29768
to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent	1.1686207
nevertheless , most of the teen-agers i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .	128.9134
however , they were hostile to jewish orthodoxy , professing to believe in judaism `` but in a moderate way ' ' .	64.22002
one boy said querulously about orthodox jews `` it ' s the twentieth century , and they don ' t have to wear beards ' ' .	18.759378
the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers ' minds .	196.07874
`` we were brought up that way ' ' was one statement which won general assent .	84.94667
`` i want to show respect for my parents ' religion ' ' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism .	161.71475
still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since i ' ll be living in a suburb ' ' .	44.276463
intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval .	111.04703
most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds .	31.6697
`` when you marry , you want to have things in common ' ' , a girl said , `` and it ' s hard when you don ' t marry someone with your own background ' ' .	47.101204
a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle west observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious .	173.84622
it appears that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .	178.63297
another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only orthodox girl in town ' ' .	126.76122
this is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant .	177.39917
one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented .	40.036545
sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning .	68.55242
this is substantially higher than the figures for the american population at large -- 45 . 6 per cent for males and 29 . 2 per cent for females .	59.073112
this may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy .	137.47603
in their first two years in high school , jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .	228.51494
however , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement .	76.7963
it is significant , too , that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts .	61.54864
the percentage of jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .	161.61208
the motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different .	57.785282
the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed .	171.90059
one of the significant developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .	295.30826
it is they who read -- and make -- jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them .	106.751945
in upper teen jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality .	28.392977
`` people automatically assume that i ' m in college ' ' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably .	61.556828
however , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college .	213.40007
the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student .	138.6694
she is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .	394.5414
one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .	109.81841
this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york , chicago , and philadelphia .	62.017265
what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish world .	158.88628
perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class jewish student .	51.38103
there is , to begin , an important sex difference .	304.54538
typically , in a lower-middle class jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college .	133.29144
first , the girl ' s education has a lower priority than the son ' s .	93.049675
second , the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son .	293.17102
most jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home .	93.51191
the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .	178.36928
one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .	112.76941
brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school .	44.25222
on the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school .	228.49924
this is particularly acute for those who attended midwood high school directly across the street from brooklyn college .	61.563198
they have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school .	138.00099
at the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .	176.76883
`` it ' s people of your own kind ' ' , a girl remarked .	33.27895
`` you don ' t have to watch what you say .	67.760284
of course , i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but i would want lots of jewish kids there ' ' .	79.79835
for most brooklyn college students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family .	85.78329
brooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing .	231.50842
however , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents .	134.71938
and the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping .	154.25955
`` as long as i ' m home , i ' ll never grow up ' ' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly .	36.778404
`` they don ' t like it if i do anything away from home .	60.56902
it ' s so much trouble , i don ' t usually bother ' ' .	20.129335
for girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive .	177.25761
parents will drive on friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting .	557.1487
a freshman girl ' s father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn college and demanded the `` low-down ' ' on a boy who was going out with his daughter .	57.3117
the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .	41.051216
under pressure from parents , the majority of brooklyn college girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours .	480.1731
this means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature .	167.89026
a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex .	70.67039
the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual .	71.349304
first , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights .	196.57819
then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of new york .	118.93979
it is significant that the catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of new york , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps .	93.9815
but it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- fire island , nantucket , westhampton , long island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously jewish .	190.87338
although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in europe .	84.946144
in general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith .	122.46865
and acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years .	93.34663
brooklyn college is marjorie morningstar territory , as much as the bronx or central park west .	140.37384
there are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry .	124.801926
it is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate .	75.03281
`` almost everybody in the senior class is married ' ' , students say dogmatically .	90.02211
and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the house plan association ) that have good news to impart .	154.73422
these announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts .	96.46157
there are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity .	49.019356
`` witt house happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz of fife house ' ' .	74.60231
the brooklyn college student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .	35.285347
the ivy league enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down ivy way .	93.16804
the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes .	124.590485
among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking .	222.19754
brooklyn college is distinctive for not having an official drinking place .	268.24875
the fort lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys .	141.79744
this should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) .	130.32736
for galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste .	96.808876
this could also be used for any other skin irritation .	35.576817
or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts .	75.101425
`` female troubles ' ' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier	76.698006
at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation .	78.435234
bruises , burns , cuts , etc . , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too .	184.79918
bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak .	102.83289
( doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain .	227.79668
) salted butter was another cure for bruises .	16.419168
many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water	110.48047
the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts .	143.6673
another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter .	114.76505
`` butter salve ' ' or `` butter ointment ' ' was used for burns , and for bruises as well .	46.645134
this was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil	48.98975
when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled .	16.216084
cow ' s milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly .	106.37096
one man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time .	110.89828
a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat ' ' .	42.979874
later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns .	422.27795
the results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known .	114.222275
to stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds .	15.24397
one old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool	72.83465
this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .	42.886723
my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds	58.436363
she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine .	85.51945
he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated	115.80446
a `` chaw ' ' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing .	75.04987
or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing .	89.07822
one old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head .	121.038795
his brother ran a mile to get the father	33229.137
when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices .	198.23535
then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place .	52.68714
there was no cleaning or further care , but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar .	64.07802
veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic .	106.10642
until quite recently , `` sterile ' ' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound	196.25731
they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated .	67.2675
tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .	76.792015
one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .	44.99127
another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke .	61.52103
rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones ' ' which the pioneer wore or carried .	103.13544
in 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in norton county , and one had been in the family for 200 years .	81.75439
another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker .	58.995304
while nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation .	97.55378
since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid .	99.311165
this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) .	64.84362
nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient ' s neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life .	56.41566
or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears .	46.804726
old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water .	103.07359
blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance .	350.85718
felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine	82.07158
this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part .	85.79409
as the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed ' ' .	57.026695
`` get a bite , spit on it ' ' was a proverb .	27.042843
yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings	174.51083
not long ago `` denver mud ' ' was most popular .	117.0753
chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived	48.687134
so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they buried themselves in the victim ' s flesh .	78.391266
bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests .	96.67206
ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing .	29.322683
for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made .	52.910583
for wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief .	129.72588
a handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water	654.42163
mud was sometimes used as well as soap .	9.814948
just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings .	33.7336
to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900 ' s , was a chore .	42.926754
bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather .	113.97646
kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .	50.561764
at times pioneer children got lice in their hair .	24.980661
a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job .	29.568686
to remove an insect from one ' s ear warm water should be inserted .	294.6746
a cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye .	27.703922
as the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation , and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out .	121.47023
another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed	547.8412
the particle would then move toward the nose , where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton .	52.26085
shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations .	127.66766
for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth .	113.78641
itching skin , considered `` just nerves ' ' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .	67.208
winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped .	70.06851
to cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water .	129.8631
they drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution .	73.45366
six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies .	179.30057
frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow .	366.0202
now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead .	82.899635
another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains .	57.086823
chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves .	181.99419
boils have always been a source of much trouble .	38.22555
a german informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice .	259.64075
another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree , steeped in water until it formed a sticky , gummy solution .	155.59203
another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns .	144.19872
one veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire ' ' .	55.342716
another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight .	69.15838
this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .	113.78293
one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times .	62.85671
another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days .	165.69652
saliva gathered in the mouth after a night ' s sleep was considered poisonous	133.14783
wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that .	180.00816
one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy .	62.169926
another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week .	67.03382
a simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way .	98.85368
one person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water	274.2251
another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily .	226.09348
another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment	116.68529
the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave .	136.34213
as the onion decayed , so did the wart .	80.09142
sore feet by calf ' s-foot , an herb from the pioneer ' s ubiquitous herb garden , or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved .	91.289185
leg cramps , one person tells me , were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard .	60.49259
this does give relief , as i can testify .	7.302054
one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps .	90.467705
pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient ' s waist .	42.734997
for sprains and swellings , one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief .	151.93073
except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one ' s dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him .	170.60085
in instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal .	170.33641
it may , on occasion , be anything but that .	95.91476
however , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine .	144.02356
again , by spreading one ' s purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad .	116.82636
this is important because , despite all the efforts of the french government , an appreciable segment of france ' s export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas .	116.10252
a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them	187.61171
he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district .	253.31181
these are the wines the french themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in france virtually no one drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis .	70.36819
the grands crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them .	70.98264
and certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown .	124.0159
there is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper .	94.26717
some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse .	92.44181
consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown ' ' -- are the requisites .	205.65422
especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts .	111.84809
most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and some other latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself .	165.11841
now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! !	101.39974
) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all .	94.89939
this is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter .	100.54345
a really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the visigoths .	183.586
faced , on the one hand , with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines , and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks , it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence .	98.2876
the one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .	243.996
only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains .	181.74512
wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .	91.73882
this is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort .	114.19248
it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .	98.23343
wine stored for a long time should be on its side	85.293465
otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it .	49.591457
when stacking wine on its side in a bin , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork .	107.478714
fat bottles , such as burgundies , have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props , such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood , to hold them in the proper reclining posture .	100.67918
too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects .	835.26245
the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right	252.27348
if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion .	90.77139
seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it prematurely .	339.29404
the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees , with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes .	125.35032
consequently , one ' s wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces .	163.33228
if one lives near a subway or an express parkway , the solution is to have one ' s wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time .	73.01167
light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine .	34.68935
all in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking	177.43903
many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork .	162.69409
no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !	223.17593
but the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .	133.20155
a white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes	73.574066
for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow .	44.45096
though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .	120.372116
but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full .	112.53
in this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ) , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .	95.70725
the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire .	155.02911
this invariably effaces any wine ' s character , and drives its fragrance underground .	70.08526
it should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in magnums -- and slower yet in tregnums , double magnums , jeroboams , methuselahs , and imperiales , respectively .	125.41567
very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air .	85.19729
white wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .	82.25987
thus , sauternes or barsacs should be very cold	148.14307
a pouilly-fuisse or a chablis somewhat less cold .	10.08446
over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .	146.32362
the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .	167.89162
to quote professor saintsbury `` the last glass of claret or burgundy is as good as the first	75.363266
but the first glass of chateau d ' yquem or montrachet is a great deal better than the last ' ' ! !	76.50796
this does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .	162.94075
if this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place	134.88014
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk .	36.28931
a few red wines , notably those of the beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .	194.80644
by tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well .	215.00827
thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken	286.5424
very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself .	113.41464
a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea .	105.741394
the cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward .	46.52537
many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment .	81.2859
another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .	131.5821
in france , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them .	115.268524
the wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted .	77.55427
it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .	88.70758
for , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs .	120.42218
though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten .	126.09777
red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer	250.32053
the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red burgundy .	860.7884
some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more .	80.561424
if a red bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while .	174.82608
most of the wines of beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young	87.606865
giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically `` rest assured that your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter and spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views ' ' .	148.7321
giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation .	6.1506767
the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john palfrey ' s overseer .	122.51322
william , who lived in neighboring st . mary ' s parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .	68.88491
giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation .	254.35176
if sold then , the land and improvements might bring only $5 , 000 .	64.0992
early in january , 1844 he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans , and upon learning of gorham ' s intention , henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother .	162.84366
the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless negroes .	73.42774
they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and louisiana law required their removal from the state .	78.422485
gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the north involved ? ?	108.80638
the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic , since no planter would take the risk of having negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves .	65.53359
henry hid his annoyance , although both he and william were furious with their yankee brother .	348.15402
william , who did not write to gorham , told giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue `` amicably ' ' to protect his interests .	91.95645
palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation .	169.86427
if william wished to continue operations for a year , why not simply leave the negroes undisturbed and pay them `` as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age .	180.02945
a disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme .	67.783714
their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement ' ' .	89.48235
when he heard of his brothers ' anger , palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages .	54.71209
if not , he was willing to accede to william ' s wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim .	117.204384
william was adamant on one point under no circumstances would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his and henry ' s slaves if they were told of their coming freedom .	124.823166
knowing the antipathy that existed in louisiana against increasing the number of free negroes , giffen suggested that palfrey bring them to boston at once , and then send them on to liberia .	74.097145
lacking specific instructions , he agreed to william ' s condition .	35.71419
in march there was a division of the slaves , and giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible .	125.357544
of the fifty-two slaves , giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females .	122.80326
`` i considered that your views would be best carried out ' ' , he explained , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of emancipation .	168.08867
i have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience & justice ' ' .	70.1525
the ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child .	61.376633
if palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited .	95.83493
this cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed .	126.46907
each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value .	258.97626
old sam ' s sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150	216.08551
rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 .	75.198784
in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property , palfrey was giving up close to $7 , 000 .	75.595375
palfrey ' s brothers each received lots of sixteen negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6 , 666 . 66 .	108.07022
thus twenty `` black souls ' ' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men .	68.07832
giffen extracted one concession from william the house servants could be free at any time gorham thought expedient .	52.365696
despite giffen ' s warning , palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in louisiana .	104.60484
yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special permission .	206.44061
according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed .	51.876587
palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement .	65.22701
otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain ' ' .	70.2203
on march 11 the louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition .	167.11304
news of the legislative veto appeared in the new orleans papers , and henry and william became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance .	64.73376
henry stormed into giffen ' s office waving a copy of the new orleans courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the `` ears of the people on the plantation , and make them restless & unhappy ' ' .	60.14208
his brothers ' anger caused palfrey genuine concern , for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself to free his slaves , and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue .	83.901024
when giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey , gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him .	99.37986
in view of these difficulties , palfrey decided to go to louisiana .	48.370323
giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters .	197.91742
his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-april .	57.801846
palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for new orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence that he might be allowed to see his family again .	76.737404
during his journey palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists .	258.83676
in both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the north .	140.64975
in new york , lydia maria child welcomed him enthusiastically `` i have lately heard of you from the legislature of louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man ' ' .	83.53788
mrs . child , who had once apologized for sending editor palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of henry palfrey ' s slaves escape to canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in louisiana .	208.33206
she agreed to take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send them north immediately .	143.67615
at lexington , kentucky , palfrey consulted with cassius m . clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result .	124.78079
despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , palfrey ' s reception in new orleans was more than cordial .	89.08756
instead of the expected `` annoyances ' ' due to the nature of his mission , he received many calling cards and invitations from `` gentlemen of mark , on whom i had no sort of claim , & have had many more invitations than i could accept ' ' .	157.98882
he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of the `` marked attention and civility ' ' with which the new orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him .	103.72832
the memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and civil war .	278.67957
palfrey ' s autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans ' ' .	114.372536
he proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high ' ' .	46.813824
palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go north for freedom .	111.50016
the women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage .	61.293804
he had a short private talk with each adult slave .	50.48414
only one objected , but palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others .	52.055607
all the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce ' ' .	46.629814
the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account .	54.101006
william ' s threat that under no conditions would he allow `` freedom-conscious ' ' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before .	101.123116
palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience ' ' .	173.17194
from cambridge , palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves .	22.782469
in fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased .	117.28523
should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , giffen was to provide passage at once .	273.59268
when a sailing date of march , 1845 was finally established , palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters in new orleans and aboard ship .	130.83308
giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the negroes with consideration .	211.63016
palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 .	158.40923
the plantation was sold in january , 1845 , and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months ' wages .	118.16933
giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year ' s work	27.748291
the new owner at attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement .	223.96109
on march 21 , 1845 the bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans , while on the levee henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father ' s former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation .	92.34846
not all of palfrey ' s slaves were aboard the bashaw .	78.854004
giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants .	58.888954
two of these were included in palfrey ' s lot .	59.336483
giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the st . martin ' s parish police jury .	90.67847
after an initial rejection , which he attributed to a `` general excitement against abolition and emancipation ' ' , giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury , and got the permission without further delay .	89.80714
when the negroes landed at boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves .	47.370247
slavery was prohibited in massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 , which declared `` all men are born free and equal ' ' .	55.007793
nevertheless , palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at king ' s chapel to formalize the emancipation .	75.45474
an eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway , and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free .	199.3599
once the question of emancipation was settled to palfrey ' s satisfaction , he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants .	94.59634
palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a negro boy in the hopedale community , but he had better luck in his other attempts .	99.31017
mrs . child , true to her word , helped place anna and her four children with a quaker family named hathaway near canandaigua , new york .	128.56233
this group had been palfrey ' s greatest worry since anna was in bad health , and her children were too young to work for their keep .	88.8413
but certainly the new frontier has brought to washington a group more varied in background and interest .	270.1515
secretary of state dean rusk , a former rhodes scholar and mills college dean , has headed the rockefeller foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange .	105.64523
one of his initial acts in office was to appoint philip coombs of the ford foundation as the first assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs .	40.565495
( `` in the late forties and fifties ' ' , coombs has declared in defining his role , `` two strong new arms were added to reinforce united states foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance .	124.799416
as we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm , aimed at the development of people , at the fuller realization of their creative human potential , and a better understanding among them ' ' .	74.39609
many of the new appointees are art collectors .	8.550452
ambassador-at-large averell harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include renoir , cezanne , gauguin , van gogh , toulouse-lautrec , degas , matisse , picasso , and walt kuhn .	33.222702
the director of the peace corps , r . sargent shriver , jr . , a kennedy brother-in-law , collects heavily among the moderns , including kenzo okada and josef albers .	31.775835
secretary of the treasury douglas dillon owns a prize monet , femmes dans un jardin .	22.800734
secretary of defense robert mcnamara , former president of the ford motor company , comes from a generation different from that of eisenhower ' s own first secretary of defense , charles wilson , who had been head of general motors .	73.83256
unlike wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism .	75.449745
an inveterate reader of books , he chose while working in detroit to live in the university community of ann arbor , almost forty miles away .	74.921364
he selected as comptroller of defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former rhodes scholar , charles hitch , who is author of a study on the economics of defense in the nuclear age .	58.94801
one of the president ' s special assistants , the harvard dean mcgeorge bundy , was co-author with henry l . stimson of the latter ' s classic memoir , on active service .	99.39734
another , arthur m . schlesinger , jr . , has won a pulitzer prize in history	28.47332
his wife , marion , is a portrait painter .	5.150361
the press secretary , pierre salinger , was a child prodigy as a pianist .	100.98443
( `` it is always of sorrow to me when i find people who neither know nor understand music ' ' , he declared not long ago in proposing that white house prizes be awarded for music and art .	187.31012
) mrs . arthur goldberg , wife of the secretary of labor , paints professionally and helps sponsor the associated artists ' gallery in the district of columbia .	99.31699
( `` artists are always at a new frontier ' ' , she claims .	40.910362
`` in fact , the search is almost more important than the find ' ' .	31.825548
) mrs . henry labouisse , wife of the new director of the foreign aid program , is the writer and lecturer eve curie .	61.470005
at last count , sixteen former rhodes scholars ( see box on page 13 ) had been appointed to the administration , second in number only to its harvard graduates .	216.93497
besides schlesinger , the justice department ' s information director , edwin guthman , has won a pulitzer prize ( for national reporting ) .	64.7566
postmaster general j . edward day , who must deal with matters of postal censorship , is himself author of a novel , bartholf street , albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense .	146.27827
william walton , a writer-turned-painter , has been a long-time friend of the president .	47.607456
they arrived in washington about the same time during the early postwar years kennedy as the young congressman from massachusetts	144.61952
walton , after a wartime stint with time-life , to become bureau chief for the new republic .	99.56532
both lived in georgetown , were unattached , and shared an active social life .	216.39474
walton , who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital ' s leading semi-abstract painters , vows that he and kennedy never once discussed art in those days .	186.05899
during last year ' s campaign , kennedy asked walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him .	121.6986
walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important new york city .	106.43666
walton , who served as a correspondent with general james gavin ' s paratroopers during the invasion of france , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy .	85.81696
he provoked outraged editorials when , after a post-inaugural inspection of the white house with mrs . kennedy , he remarked to reporters , `` we just cased the joint to see what was there ' ' .	129.0806
already the president and the first lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the white house to the renovation of lafayette square .	52.253334
a man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture .	69.025665
a more official representative is the secretary of the interior .	5.7834673
udall , who comes from one of the mormon first-families of arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight .	87.73164
but even while sparring furiously with republican politicians , he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments .	228.07643
his private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as c . p . snow , arnold toynbee , and aaron copland .	62.53852
udall argues that interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves .	60.876984
after promoting frost ' s appearance at the inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of cabinet members , members of congress , and other washington notables gathered in the state department auditorium .	113.905556
the event was so successful that the interior secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the administration .	123.116646
his ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response .	116.37274
one tempest was stirred up last march when udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of william jennings bryan , sculpted by the late gutzon borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan ' ' to salem , illinois , bryan ' s birthplace .	102.05025
spokesmen for the nation ' s tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form .	225.22102
they dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which `` dot the washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans ' ' .	118.08489
hoping to cut down on such works , udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized .	283.1899
he is not likely to win this battle easily .	1108.3839
in the case of the borglum statue an interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the secretary had no desire to `` hustle ' ' it out of washington .	85.060936
the last congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to taras shevchenko , the ukrainian poet laureate	51.6431
active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first roosevelt on theodore roosevelt island in the potomac , and tr . ' s own living children , who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary .	74.762344
the hotly debated plan for the capital ' s franklin d . roosevelt memorial , a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics , `` instant stonehenge ' ' ) , is another of udall ' s headaches , since as supervisor of the national parks commission he will share in the responsibility for building it .	66.25832
`` washington ' ' , president kennedy has been heard to remark ironically , `` is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm ' ' .	83.96438
there have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the white house .	81.957504
one of mrs . kennedy ' s initial concerns as first lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine .	114.35372
ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by president thomas jefferson , the white house has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic .	140.6674
mrs . kennedy shows a determination to change all this .	137.87253
not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the british ship h . m . s . resolute and presented to president hayes by queen victoria .	76.172226
it now serves the president in his oval office .	39.822906
later , browsing in an old issue of the gazette des beaux-arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by president james monroe .	61.91568
with its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval blue room on the first floor of the white house .	95.04291
but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which mrs . kennedy feels is the proper period for the white house ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms .	206.74709
the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee for the white house , to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them .	62.994915
her effort to put the home of living presidents on the same basis as mount vernon and monticello recognizes no party lines .	211.02385
by rough estimate her committee , headed by henry francis du pont , contains three times as many republicans as democrats .	131.6696
the press releases emanating from the white house give a clue to the activity within .	107.76866
a valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of benjamin franklin by jean-honore fragonard has been donated by the art dealer georges wildenstein and now hangs in the blue room .	143.06776
the american institute of interior designers is redecorating the white house library .	63.93512
secretary and mrs . dillon have contributed enough pieces of empire furniture , including dolley madison ' s own sofa , to furnish a room in that style .	64.44235
and part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware , bequeathed to the white house by the late mrs . margaret thompson biddle , has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the state dining room .	71.55271
woman ' s place is in the home man must attend to matters of the yard .	173.14833
one of the vexatious problems to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just across pennsylvania avenue from the white house .	111.461716
congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking lafayette square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality ' ' of government office buildings .	128.72797
while a senator , kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the belasco theater , as well as the dolley madison and the benjamin taylor houses , all scheduled for razing .	63.744316
what to do about it now that he was president ? ?	77.011086
only a few days after moving into the white house .	17.101496
kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square .	4.4058876
then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem to him , with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn ' t pile unnecessary burdens on the president .	75.04143
one of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged court of claims , diagonally across the street from the white house .	83.99402
but judge marvin jones , senior member of the court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk to work .	65.01232
more importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of sam rayburn , speaker of the house .	42.79505
there were aesthetic problems as well as political .	117.14802
on delving deeper , walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified as `` early nondescript ' ' .	48.416435
the old belasco theater , over which many people had grown sentimental , was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a uso center .	165.01222
the dolley madison house , walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving .	263.6567
`` the attempt to save the square ' s historic value ' ' , he declares , `` came half a century too late ' ' .	100.48967
surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful .	216.00351
the dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did .	86.154724
but his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures .	102.34107
he is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be .	86.62094
he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart .	88.85401
the men ' s shops on hanover ' s main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven .	33.049953
and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend , toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia .	202.93538
but there has always been an outdoor air to dartmouth .	69.127785
the would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .	586.1925
no one here pokes fun at manly virtues .	3.4108245
and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league .	79.501526
thus , when dartmouth ' s winter carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o ' -shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a smith girl .	170.06964
president dickey ' s golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .	97.79662
this carefree disdain for `` side ' ' cropped up again in the same television broadcast .	124.13364
dean thaddeus seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival .	155.58862
she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .	185.69708
dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .	26.256454
for example , groups regularly canoe down the connecticut river .	159.41316
this is in honor of john ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days .	135.11646
and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .	11.311008
they are hailed by the nation ' s press , and smith girls throng the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses .	152.85103
dartmouth ' s favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .	19.344852
since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the united states , the students have stopped regarding the olympic ski team as another name for their own .	94.46359
yet dartmouth still is the dominant member of the intercollegiate ski union , which includes the winter sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country .	51.240112
dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door .	68.11475
they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to oak hill , where there ' s a lift .	66.619606
the dartmouth skiway , at holt ' s ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the east , ranging from novice to expert .	104.441414
forty miles farther north is mount moosilauke , dartmouth ' s own mountain .	38.341434
here , at the ravine lodge , president dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the dartmouth outing club to life on the trails .	86.055855
the lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room .	174.33833
the outing club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through hanover to the college grant -- 27 , 000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country .	110.43091
the cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips .	46.99091
the club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing .	47.71847
under the auspices of the outing club , dartmouth also has the mountaineering club , which takes on tough climbs like mount mckinley , and bait & bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a woodman ' s team , which competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like .	173.89656
there is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon .	128.38142
city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp .	126.7197
and on the summit of mount washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas `` because it is there ' ' .	84.477264
there is much to be said for such a college -- and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly .	84.20423
their affection for their college home has even caused president dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty ' ' as something rather specially hanoverian .	204.26009
probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the supreme court of the united states .	21.835793
early in the nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university .	96.58543
it fixed on dartmouth college , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered .	659.59015
the legislators decided to `` liberate ' ' dartmouth and entered into a tug-o ' -war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel .	146.77722
for a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body .	60.782486
the struggle was resolved in 1819 in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history .	41.707428
in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters .	58.96358
a lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for dartmouth daniel webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea .	111.65045
in an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly tears , as uncle dan ' l reached his thundering climax	201.65457
`` it is , sir , as i have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it .	68.75332
dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to webster ' s eloquence .	86.53673
this is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the ivy group .	107.56151
eleazar wheelock , a presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor .	171.41954
eleazar , pausing on the hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first college hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences	225.8646
and also of english youth and any others ' ' .	8.094484
it was a hardy undertaking , and wheelock ' s was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness ' ' .	36.084644
a road had to be hacked through trackless forests between hanover and portsmouth to permit governor wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first dartmouth commencement in 1771 .	120.777565
the governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college .	62.52558
the exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings .	205.38687
a student orator `` produced tears from a great number of the learned ' ' even before the punch was served .	64.695526
then from the branches of a near-by tree an indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the english language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue .	122.09304
governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached .	143.9256
the cook got drunk , and president wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself .	186.48683
future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace .	154.32402
by the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the big three , columbia , and penn were populous centers of learning , dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine .	216.88315
the dormitories , including the beloved dartmouth hall , could barely house two hundred students in spartan fashion .	176.98795
then in 1893 dr . william jewett tucker became president and the college ' s great awakening began .	62.540012
he transformed dartmouth from a small new hampshire institution into a national college .	92.75465
by 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1 , 107 .	23.902855
and at his last commencement , in that year , dr . tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college .	66.224205
the presidents of cornell , wisconsin , c . c . n . y . , bowdoin , vermont , brown , columbia , princeton , yale , and harvard and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there .	42.280697
dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .	84.37175
but it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside new england .	85.0302
over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class .	144.29433
only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation .	62.16388
about two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .	26.716978
it is still a college only and not a university	193.69836
it is , in fact , the only college in the ivy group .	216.57343
however , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the dartmouth medical school ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the thayer school of engineering , and the amos tuck school of business administration .	124.36694
all three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .	128.56522
all three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study .	159.75453
students of the college who are candidates for the a . b . degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year .	154.34212
the thayer school offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a b . s . in engineering .	88.32623
so dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the ivy group .	40.10191
it is still , however , the junior member of the league , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do .	139.30092
it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other ivies have enjoyed .	152.514
however much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition .	264.55423
it has come on with a rush in more significant areas .	107.23621
today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .	672.1995
but dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy .	113.87053
president emeritus hopkins once proposed to corral an `` aristocracy of brains ' ' in hanover .	57.781315
the person who left the buggy there has never been identified .	31.907755
it was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside .	64.05584
there are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against emma .	149.27641
she didn ' t like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage .	141.53757
she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed .	248.22536
she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels .	238.63907
if she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her .	138.56529
if police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect .	128.9637
uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate popular suspect .	75.20036
his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer .	105.482994
lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day .	74.605194
it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her uncle morse .	77.116585
at that time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s . phillips .	58.430733
a few years ago , not too long before his death , phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders .	105.81464
he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from lizzie .	107.47313
it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door .	182.41339
the new bedford standard-times has reported knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what borden said during his conversation with morse , he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	67.325745
notice , knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of lizzie borden .	34.70588
he said he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	2.362203
it is known that morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at westport , a town not far from fall river .	142.32507
they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters .	115.21994
fall river police did go to westport to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men .	219.3583
morse ' s alibi was not as solid as it seemed .	100.96864
he said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11 20 streetcar .	148.36243
the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner .	129.73975
if this woman had delayed until after 11 20 to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days .	116.740105
it is possible that morse told the woman it was 11 20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time .	132.365
police did make an attempt to check on morse ' s alibi .	41.516884
they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember morse as a passenger .	63.47903
questioned further , morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him .	60.858
the conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so morse ' s statement really proved nothing .	254.36995
we do know that morse left the house before nine o ' clock .	46.596127
bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door .	13.19178
morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door .	14.710275
from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away .	62.32014
he met nobody he knew on this walk .	8.875244
there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs . borden was killed .	213.29489
morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , mrs . borden told the servant , `` bridget , i want you to wash these windows today ' ' .	52.09177
bridget ' s testimony was in direct contradiction .	11.009939
she said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs . borden told her to wash the windows .	73.473526
this was long after morse had left the house .	50.21401
morse ' s knowledge of what mrs . borden told bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there .	83.87507
he knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone .	89.218834
and despite knowlton ' s attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true .	85.24862
the screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back .	70.384964
it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows .	12.846884
morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied .	55.6253
mrs . borden would not have been alarmed if she saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .	57.543583
he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm .	67.57407
mrs . borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out .	185.21893
he could have left for weybosset street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar .	245.66942
if he took an earlier streetcar than the 11 20 on his return , he could have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr . borden came home .	95.66085
with lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and bridget upstairs in her attic room , he would have had free and easy access to the house .	47.789673
with the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood .	175.70074
his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding the side door , was odd .	64.7721
there was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them .	106.899666
and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed .	159.95546
there was no financial gain for morse in the murders .	24.436712
on the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying .	58.90572
the time would have been shortly after the murder of mrs . borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior .	117.5999
he said he had promised mrs . borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden house .	73.24342
what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? ?	96.98255
`` the police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr . morse as in possession of guilty knowledge .	92.61203
indeed , it was probably to mr . morse ' s advantage to have mr . and mrs . borden alive .	39.19753
both he and bridget were exonerated by lizzie herself ' ' .	67.44193
that was his complete discussion of bridget sullivan as a possible suspect .	38.66973
although pearson disbelieved almost everything lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about bridget as the whole truth .	149.19672
he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl .	134.4955
the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but lizzie ' s expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of assistant marshal fleet .	88.20199
this officer had asked lizzie if she suspected her uncle morse , and she replied she didn ' t think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them .	56.986572
fleet asked the same question about bridget , and lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her room before her father ' s murder and came down when she called her .	64.52897
lizzie , actually , never named any suspect .	19.226826
she told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner .	113.35105
and , much as she detested hiram harrington , she also did not accuse him .	43.72478
at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father .	267.17682
she replied , `` i know of one man that has not been friendly with him .	39.33102
they have not been friendly for years ' ' .	1.7127067
asked who this was , she named harrington .	54.730095
the press reported the same facts in using harrington ' s interview , but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the killer .	52.319904
when i interviewed kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the borden yard , i asked if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders .	87.42813
he said he had not heard of anybody else .	6.0079255
`` how about bridget sullivan ' ' ? ?	1.200603
`` oh , she was just the maid there ' ' , he replied , waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was .	178.86002
kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders .	76.23723
everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders lizzie borden and bridget sullivan .	65.29453
all the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers .	175.98314
true , it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations .	89.03536
the actions of bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence .	166.67383
there are also other factors that require closer examination .	38.189312
the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle ' ' of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut .	129.32153
the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of lizzie .	220.35635
if bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been lizzie borden .	97.56644
bridget was born in ireland , one of fourteen children .	158.5981
she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time .	40.223564
she worked as a domestic , first in newport for a year , and then in south bethlehem , pennsylvania , for another year .	53.162025
she finally settled in fall river and , after being employed for a time by a mrs . reed , was hired by the bordens .	96.148705
i have previously described how , during the week of the murder , bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes .	108.68872
her father , james upton , was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port .	111.9687
a gentleman of the old school , mr . upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted christian .	120.880295
the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects .	47.042923
her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests .	65.59318
there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood had an unusual mind .	134.57716
she possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty .	81.72071
when she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited .	131.92017
she named 48 items , and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write ' ' .	109.04182
an essay on `` freedom ' ' written at 10 years of age quoted the declaration of independence , the freedom given to slaves in canada , and the views of george washington .	99.61399
lucy upton was graduated from the salem high school when few colleges , only oberlin and elmira , were open to women	160.46654
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .	22.128958
a picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , albert s . flint , friend of her brother winslow , and later , like winslow , a noted astronomer .	58.605995
he recalled lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys ' study hall to join the class in greek in the little recitation room beyond ' ' .	156.4898
the study of greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and lucy upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .	93.230125
the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this .	144.61435
with four younger children at home , lucy stepped into her mother ' s role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father ' s comfort and stay until he died in 1879 .	50.671665
but even so lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits .	222.83066
when her brother winslow became a student at brown university in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under professor diman `` what is prof . diman ' s definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ? ?	142.28001
do you think i might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you .	301.09607
' ' and that she proceeded to do .	84.82027
many years later ( on august 3 , 1915 ) , lucy upton wrote winslow ' s daughter soon to be graduated from smith college `` while i love botany which , after dabbling in for years , i studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school , it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing .	98.96904
whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study .	198.19196
she read maitland ' s dark ages , `` which i enjoyed very much ' '	96.641266
la croix on the customs of the middle ages , 16 chapters of bryce `` and liked it more and more ' '	112.78613
she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone .	84.00423
lucy ' s correspondence with brother winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies .	353.41733
also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately ' ' .	56.88984
who won is not revealed , but winslow ' s daughter eleanor says they got up to 1 , 212 words .	134.13792
winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him .	118.41339
at different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist .	383.07956
and it was lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music at spelman college .	132.37764
winslow upton after graduation from brown university and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the harvard observatory .	86.9285
for three years he was connected with the u . s . naval observatory and with the u . s . signal corps	28.551363
and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at brown university .	36.16726
the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to colorado , virginia , and california as well as to the south pacific and to russia .	45.294968
after her father ' s death , lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington , d . c . .	48.483738
`` their house ' ' , writes albert s . flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home ' ' .	92.60673
lucy was a lively part of the household .	252.30138
moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor .	272.78113
winslow , as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister ' ' .	78.81092
there is reason to suppose that lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother ' s death occurred just as she was about to enter college .	118.71099
as a matter of fact , albert s . flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings ' ' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country ' ' .	167.85608
while in washington , d . c . , lucy upton held positions in the u . s . census office , and in the pension bureau .	43.384995
they were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to germany with her brother winslow and his family while he was there on study .	84.767105
after the months in europe , she returned to boston and became active in church and community life .	159.56793
what was called an `` accidental meeting ' ' with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman .	88.545845
after correspondence with miss packard and to the joy of miss packard and miss giles , she came to atlanta , in the fall of 1888 , to help wherever needed , although there was then no money available to pay her a salary .	84.30728
she served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance .	205.12819
her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students	175.9474
of her `` great power of discernment ' '	1.0781494
of `` her exquisiteness of dress ' ' , `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers ' '	67.38442
her great love of flowers and plants and birds	189.78738
she drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world	40.450584
and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well .	99.846054
many a student was able to remain at spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help .	168.51587
under miss upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption .	928.81
after all , she had come to spelman seminary in 1888 , and had been since 1891 except for one year , associate principal or dean .	92.33494
she had taught classes in botany , astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ) , geometry , and psychology .	81.444275
miss upton and miss packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common .	90.98594
and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and christian zeal .	132.99268
both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding .	22.797916
in 1890 when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss packard , it was miss upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability ' ' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end ' ' .	133.37556
so strenuous it was physically , with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both miss packard and miss upton .	104.19866
at the fifteenth anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted , miss upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future as a college of first rank , with expanding and unlimited horizons .	105.48506
when dr . wallace buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the science building named for him , he wrote miss tapley ( april 7 , 1923 ) `` if you had asked me , i think i would have suggested that you name the building for miss upton .	100.010254
her services to the school for many years were of a very high character , and i have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her ' ' .	77.36339
such were the qualities of the acting-president of the seminary after the death of miss giles .	37.651478
at the meeting of the board of trustees , on march 3 , 1910 , miss upton presented the annual report of the president .	35.677563
she noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence	334.00433
that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired	1147.747
and that the year ' s work had gone forward smoothly .	27.318281
she urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .	48.15214
the raising of the $25 , 000 improvement fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration ' ' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to miss giles .	118.50123
with the fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid	158.29845
and ground had been broken for the superintendent ' s home .	28.582964
miss upton spoke gratefully of the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise the fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .	98.3969
she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results .	238.82063
two bequests were recorded one of $200 under the will of mrs . harriet a . copp of los angeles	122.09874
and one of $2 , 000 under the will of miss celia l . brett of hamilton , new york , a friend from the early days .	73.43979
miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss giles was `` the sorest grief ' ' the seminary had ever been called upon to bear .	75.726875
the daughters of spelman , she said , had never known or thought of spelman without her .	356.47754
the removal of miss packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow , but they still had miss giles .	127.05168
`` yet spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come ' ' .	43.71343
miss mary jane packard , sophia ' s half-sister , became ill in march , 1910	71.991425
and when school closed , she was unable to travel to massachusetts .	51.966446
before coming on a visit to spelman in 1885 , miss mary had been a successful teacher in worcester , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period .	150.27571
she helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping .	133.26825
soon the office work claimed all her time .	9.211407
she was closely associated with the founders in all their trials and hardships .	256.60193
quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary .	59.206043
miss giles always used to refer to her as `` sister ' ' .	26.773426
she served as secretary in the seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping .	69.753296
the books of the school hold a memorial to her	82.66611
and so do the hearts of students and of teachers .	374.92996
mary j . packard , states a messenger editorial , was `` efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her master .	53.864384
with infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer .	153.64145
in a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .	237.87753
in those vocational programs organized with smith-hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other .	51.59078
in these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 .	103.91188
the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school .	53.594925
these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work .	103.86298
formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation .	75.903984
the `` diversified occupations ' ' program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers .	113.70787
the `` distributive education ' ' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields .	97.53662
in both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half .	166.9008
in a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation .	112.03107
adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth .	167.80374
in general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next .	111.543655
if the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete .	104.03186
when there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well .	316.30734
indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .	133.238
statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one .	109.6218
i make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .	93.34293
he may or may not be `` better off ' ' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school .	101.82967
but in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .	156.20354
in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , i shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found .	72.22726
in the negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation .	76.85902
high motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .	238.0702
undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the negro schools .	105.72183
however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual .	32.438343
and the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .	140.67793
this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern universities .	34.812527
quite the contrary , as i can testify from personal experience as a former university president .	268.9705
the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic careers .	211.6111
i believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized .	431.75745
here again we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated as negroes in the press .	57.52474
how can the vicious circle be broken ? ?	1.0855436
this is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both negro and white , should devote far more attention .	136.08258
it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south .	100.03625
i should like to underline four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education .	78.04488
first and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation .	185.95938
second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student ' s time in those years	73.773544
however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier .	175.30682
third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work	172.77322
they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time .	68.342224
fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .	35.117577
this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .	147.90056
vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore ' ' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .	187.47337
those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .	113.843765
i have been using the word `` vocational ' ' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used .	83.42204
i intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .	225.8731
these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic ' ' .	107.647156
practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill .	65.96549
they are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school .	33.9129
to be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .	140.65921
similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school .	128.62384
of course , it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill .	74.011406
so , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics .	60.297367
in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained .	140.24251
in spite of the shading of one type of course into another , i believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses .	195.72395
perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule .	95.9735
today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school .	81.78738
most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools .	150.52693
in this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts .	64.53848
the neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school .	66.740685
indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs .	93.88717
he prefers to designate such schools as `` general ' ' high schools .	40.462006
the suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs .	104.35669
the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .	11.965871
therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report .	100.05739
the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .	64.464294
by and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system .	117.732704
it is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .	93.42959
one has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` i want to be a plumber ' ' , and then , by doing good work , find a job .	94.41139
it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation .	205.16614
two stories will illustrate what i have in mind .	36.202827
one vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .	106.5656
in the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can ' t get in .	104.39412
in a far distant part of the united states , i was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work .	91.96298
`` what does he have in mind to do when he graduates ' ' ? ?	30.363503
`` oh , he ' ll be a plumber ' ' , came the answer .	56.723736
`` but isn ' t it almost impossible to get into the union ' ' ? ?	22.261484
`` he ' ll have no difficulty ' ' , i was told .	15.287121
`` he has very good connections ' ' .	1.5148245
in my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .	348.0994
ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest .	102.007
an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the dunbar vocational high school in chicago .	53.85049
located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students .	120.609985
hardly a window has been broken since dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) .	162.72258
i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were negroes .	170.91808
they were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics .	81.94023
the physical facilities at dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils .	86.601776
the soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world .	61.35419
in the united states , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil .	81.95063
the residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds .	96.27317
soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the orient .	64.544914
american chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of indonesia .	113.1533
soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk ' ' , and curd can be bought in the united states .	23.951805
peanuts are the world ' s second most important legume .	24.516148
we produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed .	202.05469
blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off .	153.94339
cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of asia and africa .	61.326225
in western europe and north america , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed .	99.0323
rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats .	54.94336
people depend less on seeds for foods in australia , new zealand , and argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high .	149.04115
feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world ' s cereal crop in 1957-1958 .	42.291454
most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry .	35.544468
about 90 percent of the corn used in the united states is fed to animals .	32.099598
the rest is used for human food and industrial products .	64.98836
more than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock .	55.102985
more than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the united states .	20.111946
the efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the united states since the 1930 ' s and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil .	66.85714
the demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops .	164.63739
seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position .	116.476494
chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax , castor , tung ( nuts from the china wood-oil tree ) , perilla ( from an oriental mint ) , and oiticica ( from a brazilian tree ) .	102.19064
oils , or liquid fats , from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal .	49.890617
these oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances .	188.64839
the artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages .	71.19288
one of the finest of artists ' oils comes from poppy seeds .	67.595184
seeds of soybean , cotton , corn , sesame , and rape yield semidrying oils .	63.61651
some are used in paints along with drying oils .	5.577173
palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin .	80.2707
castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine .	135.28658
this nondrying oil , however , is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant , as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment , and as a source of chemicals to make plastics .	59.687454
almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances .	52.64328
it is still used in drugs and cosmetics , but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds .	90.86437
liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives .	158.74898
sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins .	84.007996
solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree , the shea tree , and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries .	44.302246
seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world .	94.73518
corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the united states , canada , and australia .	14.654537
in other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region , starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch .	136.98936
starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations .	72.55007
gums were extracted from quince , psyllium ( fleawort ) , flax , and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times .	68.26055
today the yearly import into the united states of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds	68.151306
of psyllium seed , more than 2 . 6 million .	10.737293
the discovery during the second world war that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western asia and initiated it in the united states .	82.19914
water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents .	49.249557
guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream .	5.84234
quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions .	632.1789
once regarded as an agricultural nuisance , psyllium was sold in the 1930 ' s as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands .	69.14848
locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper .	57.474316
the seeds of hard , fibrous , stony fruits , called nuts , provide highly concentrated foods , oils , and other materials of value .	103.48308
most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick , adherent , brown covering -- the seedcoat .	271.08936
the kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily .	34.1172
almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein .	60.521618
the world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds , brazil nuts , filberts , and the english walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually .	43.69694
coconuts , the fruit of the coconut palm , have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in south pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets .	169.89302
the oil palm of west africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit .	46.64558
world production of copra , the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut , was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 .	29.891891
exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons , about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil .	128.87634
other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg	178.99124
the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins	408.19403
the marking nut , used for ink and varnish	87.1451
and the sweet-smelling cumara nut , which is suited for perfumes .	46.284157
a forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm .	146.06981
the so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed .	81.32432
it is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery .	155.02202
seeds of the sago palm are used in bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists .	111.25967
the color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations .	185.94757
since biblical times , rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an asiatic grass .	111.810715
bead tree seeds are the necklaces of south pacific islanders and the eyes of buddha dolls in cuba .	110.41974
victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry .	211.9783
handmade christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year .	70.29105
tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components .	35.38921
although science has given us more effective materials , preparations from anise , castorbean , colchicum , nux vomica , mustard , fennel , and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments .	62.02891
flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons .	69.565125
peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection .	114.0869
still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible .	190.03207
the common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group .	143.88058
each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported .	52.14948
single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica .	47.33529
less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom .	68.16444
white pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit .	66.09912
sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in egypt , brazil , and central america , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds .	89.351456
it is a main flavoring for halvah , the candy of the middle east .	28.141014
sesame sticks , a snack dip , originated in the southwest .	9.321492
beverages are made from seeds the world over .	26.085167
coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree .	13.682422
world production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons .	31.881285
per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the united states .	6.4241543
cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree .	28.69844
world production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between africa ( 63 percent ) and south america ( 27 percent ) .	125.58903
several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts , the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the west indies and south america .	25.86475
cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages .	26.496378
the japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain .	70.01127
arrack is distilled from fermented rice in india .	9.028799
beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage .	64.61882
beer was brewed by the babylonians and egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago .	86.82067
brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley .	198.30275
distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol .	25.443499
seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the united states .	52.32633
the farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year .	42.80032
cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised .	229.34412
the economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater , because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn , oats , barley , and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed , cottonseed , and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry , meat , and dairy products .	58.78464
seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock .	16.95096
hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed .	164.89455
seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed .	71.394844
more than 11 thousand business establishments in the united states were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 .	27.099176
the value of products from these industries was 15 . 8 billion dollars , of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes .	205.59842
not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products .	30.690958
cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the american diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry .	45.812057
to hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin ' ' ' ' em .	64.618546
to keep ' em scattered somewhat and yet herd ' em was called `` loose herdin ' ' ' .	41.487667
to hold ' em in a compact mass was `` close herdin ' ' ' .	15.613397
cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted .	121.040924
that became their `` home range ' ' .	2.5987666
yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin ' grass and water .	85.58562
these became `` strays ' ' , the term bein ' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses ' ' , not merely `` strays ' ' .	71.54431
cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over .	191.95001
you had to go with ' em or wait till the storm was over , and follow .	122.36533
such marchin ' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift ' ' , or `` winter drift ' ' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range .	58.75634
the cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals .	47.125755
the single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays ' '	14.499484
but when a large number were `` bunched up ' ' or `` banded up ' ' , and marched away from their home range , as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a `` drift ' ' .	46.16759
drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede .	87.69869
drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had ' nough sense to avoid ' em , and to find shelter for ' emselves .	251.50046
the wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards , and sometimes droughts , over a wide range of territory was called a `` die-up ' ' .	64.688644
followin ' such an event there was usually a harvest of `` fallen hides ' ' , and the ranchers needed skinnin ' knives instead of brandin ' irons .	108.09465
cattle were said to be `` potted ' ' when `` blizzard choked ' ' , that is , caught in a corner or a draw , or against a `` drift fence ' ' durin ' a storm .	83.15079
cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill ' ' .	29.470013
when cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up ' ' .	66.532684
this term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin ' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` he arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm ' ' .	103.49442
cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature ' em into prime beef were said to be `` double wintered ' ' .	103.75117
cattle brought into a range from a distance were called `` immigrants ' ' .	82.55431
them new to the country were referred to as `` pilgrims ' ' .	19.45704
this word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot .	140.42319
hereford cattle were often called `` white faces ' ' , or `` open-face cattle ' ' , and the old-time cowman gave the name of `` hothouse stock ' ' to them newly introduced cattle .	109.37566
because holstein cattle weren ' t a beef breed , they were rarely seen on a ranch , though one might be found now and then for the milk supply .	76.48268
the cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies ' ' .	7.258173
a `` cattaloe ' ' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle .	27.47698
`` dry stock ' ' denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin ' no milk .	228.02892
a `` wet herd ' ' was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows , while `` wet stuff ' ' referred to cows givin ' milk .	67.00771
the cowboy ' s humorous name for a cow givin ' milk was a `` milk pitcher ' ' .	15.3592205
cows givin ' no milk were knowed as `` strippers ' ' .	10.674275
the terminology of the range , in speakin ' of `` dry stock ' ' and `` wet stock ' ' , was confusin ' to the tenderfoot .	50.791798
the most common reference to `` wet stock ' ' was with the meanin ' that such animals had been smuggled across the rio grande after bein ' stolen from their rightful owners .	124.59773
the term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals .	443.65912
`` mixed herd ' ' meant a herd of mixed sexes , while a `` straight steer herd ' ' was one composed entirely of steers , and when the cowman spoke of `` mixed cattle ' ' , he meant cattle of various grades , ages , and sexes .	67.96454
in the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass , this was spoken of as `` turn-out time ' ' , or `` put to grass ' ' .	69.32419
`` shootin ' ' em out ' ' was gettin ' cattle out of a corral onto the range .	157.32771
when a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin ' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin ' ' ' .	75.84903
to stir cattle up and get ' em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle ' ' , and the act was called `` ginnin ' ' em ' round ' ' , or `` chousin ' ' em ' ' .	39.494785
after a roundup the pushin ' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called `` throwin ' over ' ' .	119.5426
a cow rose from the ground rear end first .	642.4875
by the time her hindquarters were in a standin ' position , her knees were on the ground in a prayin ' attitude .	239.30737
it was when she was in this position that the name `` prayin ' cow ' ' was suggested to the cowboy .	79.417305
they were said to be `` on their heads ' ' when grazin ' .	82.71843
`` on the hoof ' ' was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin ' to cattle travelin ' by trail under their own power as against goin ' by rail .	224.9155
shippin ' cattle by train was called a `` stock run ' ' .	27.018585
a general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers ' ' .	5.695863
when a cowboy spoke of `` dustin ' ' ' a cow , he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes .	148.31363
the cow , unlike a bull or steer , kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin ' , and a cow `` on the prod ' ' or `` on the peck ' ' was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges .	83.26093
the injun ' s name for beef was `` wohaw ' ' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the injun on the trails .	75.70031
the first cattle the injuns saw under the white man ' s control were the ox teams of the early freighters .	93.25494
listenin ' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted `` whoa ' ' , `` haw ' ' , and `` gee ' ' , they thought them words the names of the animals , and began callin ' cattle `` wohaws ' ' .	39.019615
rarely did a trail herd pass through the injun country on its march north that it wasn ' t stopped to receive demand for `` wohaw ' ' .	136.42361
`` tailin ' ' ' was the throwin ' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope .	61.97301
any animal could when travelin ' fast , be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin ' the brute , seizin ' its tail , and givin ' the latter a pull to one side .	315.28577
this throwed the animal off balance , and over it ' d crash onto its head and shoulders .	144.61662
though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin ' results , many men assured success through a turn of the tail ' bout the saddle horn , supplemented sometimes , in the case of cattle , by a downward heave of the rider ' s leg upon the strainin ' tail .	87.61572
such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough `` tailin ' ' ' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed ' im that he ' d behave for the rest of the day .	48.29976
it required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin ' rider .	101.64246
when cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was ' round .	158.17389
when the cowboy used the word `` tailin ' s ' ' , he meant stragglers .	15.730974
`` bull tailin ' ' ' was a game once pop ' lar with the mexican cowboys of texas .	224.83336
from a pen of wild bulls one would be released , and with much yellin ' a cowhand ' d take after ' im .	149.24069
seizin ' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin ' the bull off balance , and `` bustin ' ' ' ' im with terrific force .	80.51957
rammin ' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold ' im down was called `` peggin ' ' ' .	73.522446
colors of cattle came in for their special names .	19.181086
an animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a `` brindle ' ' or `` brockle ' ' .	55.94333
a `` lineback ' ' was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin ' down its back , while a `` lobo stripe ' ' was the white , yeller , or brown stripe runnin ' down the back , from neck to tail , a characteristic of many spanish cattle .	99.25654
a `` mealynose ' ' was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter ' n the rest of its body ' round the eyes , face , and nose .	121.09173
such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed ' ' .	36.739616
`` sabinas ' ' was a spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin ' .	151.09122
the northern cowboy called all the red mexican cattle which went up the trail `` sonora reds ' ' , while they called all cattle drove up from mexico `` yaks ' ' , because they came from the yaqui injun country , or gave ' em the name of `` mexican buckskins ' ' .	58.03604
near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin ' on the sides and belly , were called `` zorrillas ' ' .	113.759056
this word was from the spanish , meanin ' `` polecat ' ' .	53.0974
`` yeller bellies ' ' were cattle of mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color .	101.161064
an animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a `` marker ' ' .	69.92046
such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler .	14.7877445
countin ' each grazin ' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin ' it back so that it didn ' t mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count ' ' .	57.704575
the countin ' of cattle in a pasture without throwin ' ' em together for the purpose was called a `` pasture count ' ' .	56.691906
the counters rode through the pasture countin ' each bunch of grazin ' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn ' t get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead .	86.1717
this method of countin ' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd .	85.96473
them notes and mortgages were spoken of as `` cattle paper ' ' .	77.243774
a `` book count ' ' was the sellin ' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller .	91.408585
this led to the famous sayin ' in the northwest of the `` books won ' t freeze ' ' .	29.500494
this became a common byword durin ' the boom days when eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests .	254.73372
the origin of this sayin ' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of luke murrin .	98.431625
his saloon was a meetin ' place for influential wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin ' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin ' long faces , he said , `` cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won ' t freeze ' ' .	124.02412
in this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin ' custom of buyin ' by book count , and created a sayin ' which has survived through the years .	221.73502
`` range delivery ' ' meant that the buyer , after examinin ' the seller ' s ranch records and considerin ' his rep ' tation for truthfulness , paid for what the seller claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it .	206.96626
when a cowhand said that a man had `` good cow sense ' ' , he meant to pay ' im a high compliment .	96.94552
no matter by what name cattle were called , there was no denyin ' that they not only saved texas from financial ruin , but went far toward redeemin ' from a wilderness vast territories of the northwest .	189.25185
the first use of the word `` rustler ' ' was as a synonym for `` hustler ' ' , becomin ' an established term for any person who was active , pushin ' , and bustlin ' in any enterprise .	52.375595
again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler , and when the order was given to go out and `` rustle the hosses ' ' , it meant for ' im to go out and herd ' em in .	80.267975
eventually herdin ' the hosses was spoken of as `` hoss rustlin ' ' ' , and the wrangler was called the `` hoss rustler ' ' .	25.68109
later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief , startin ' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to `` get out and rustle a few mavericks ' ' .	99.60692
it was john who found the lion tracks .	13.244204
he found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and jones knew it was a hot trail .	147.32732
he stifled the comanche yell and let john lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain .	170.91563
this mountain was known as the black reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass .	84.88922
on the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly .	215.6206
kearton and ulyate had started the day together while jones followed the dogs , and means and loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the reef and pointed .	118.68371
`` that ' s the colonel ' ' , he said , `` but i can ' t see the dogs ' ' .	17.251177
as they watched , jones rode straight for the reef .	10.28866
then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him .	72.36526
the dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ?	44.032326
the pack had made a bend to the north , swinging back toward the reef , and kearton and ulyate could hear them faintly .	94.26713
kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring loveless and means and the rest of the party .	103.206184
`` not yet ' ' , cautioned ulyate .	14.471979
jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern toe of the reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , old john with his grand canyon voice outstanding above the others .	122.80502
there was sounder , too , also a veteran of the north rim , and rastus and the rake from a pack of english fox-hounds , and a collie from a london pound , and simba , a terrier .	103.224495
a motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty .	377.52008
jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on .	179.2232
ulyate said , and kearton touched a match to the pile of grass , blew on it and flame licked out .	57.170753
he threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose .	86.752266
`` that will fetch the gang and tell the colonel where we are ' ' .	86.00134
then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying .	6.292077
kearton and ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound .	138.70935
it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away .	203.65797
at the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot .	108.57435
the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when kearton lost sight of ulyate and called , ulyate answered from ten feet away .	199.4678
nice country to meet a lion in face to face .	14.274255
ulyate and kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the crest , and peering through the branches of a bush , this is what ulyate saw jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside , sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness , who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs whirled around her .	136.92613
ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to lips , almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off , `` the dogs have got her bayed .	275.29626
she ' s just the other side of that bush ' ' ! !	100.24344
and when they had drawn back a step he added `` jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her .	129.10904
why she doesn ' t charge him , i don ' t know .	13.641999
and he hasn ' t even got a knife on him .	161.87285
he couldn ' t get away from her in this kind of ground .	171.72945
careful , don ' t disturb her ' ' .	1.4603865
jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the reef .	59.502766
she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared , opening her mouth wide , lashing her tail , and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation , as much as to say `` how dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct ' ' ? ?	110.99165
intuition told him , however , that she was tired and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge , yet .	145.0188
he moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less predictable than the male .	79.01581
( in the graveyard at nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso .	201.96213
of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses .	36.344387
) she snarled terribly but intuition told him , again , that she was bluffing , and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs .	96.34683
it was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock .	169.37527
even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her .	205.05827
but john nipped her rear end -- one lion ' s rear end was as good as another to john , africa , arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at john , but he ducked back .	252.51852
jones then recoiled his rope and threw again , this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her .	230.47142
she whirled and faced him , roaring terribly , and ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him , because he wouldn ' t have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace uncertain	92.39082
while jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer .	395.77316
from the lioness ' point of view , this strange creature on the back of another creature , lashing out with its long thin paw , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with .	149.84387
but now she sank lower to the rock .	7.530306
although she appeared more subdued and defeated , jones knew she was growing more dangerous .	146.9546
she was rested and could mount a charge .	27.838795
just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet .	80.20481
at this moment , loveless and means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks .	44.44207
the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded old john .	132.41336
`` we ' ve got to get her out of there ' ' ! !	43.397213
jones yelled , `` or she ' ll kill ' em all .	76.68338
for such an emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of their equipment .	125.25789
lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed .	98.78696
`` ain ' t she a beauty , though ' ' ? ?	13.480905
`` don ' t you go a step nearer her than i do ' ' , jones warned , `` and if you do , go at a run so you ' ll have momentum ' ' ! !	62.36092
for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the reef , trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw .	141.82861
but she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away .	62.08967
it was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again .	225.67221
and the sun was beginning to go down .	11.577188
`` i ' ll get a pole ' ' , jones said finally , `` and i ' ll poke a noose over her head ' ' ! !	52.762516
at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the reef .	36.35008
ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions ' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason .	174.54994
`` it won ' t work , colonel ' ' .	14.938383
`` just the same we ' ll try it ' ' .	4.3915505
but without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain .	96.395134
john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood .	198.35391
john himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning .	81.17543
she took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up .	38.699337
with the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land .	109.15293
`` careful , now ' ' , jones warned .	8.562835
very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion .	87.20504
they tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion , but these didn ' t .	76.71926
again she snarled , and again he edged .	14.539591
with a whirling jump , it could get into gear .	238.34134
however nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a cheetah .	72.13736
she was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here jones and loveless and ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound .	122.93239
means held steady one jump ahead of her .	12.83959
a western cowpony had outrun an african lion , from a standing start .	74.87751
photos showed later that she ' d been about six feet from means .	178.27565
of course the factor of head start made all the difference .	77.42461
the lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn ' t catch means , and made for jones .	56.558037
as she had done with means , she gained rapidly at first , but then baldy began to draw away .	260.0778
somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point .	147.8837
when jones too drew away , she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully , crouched low and waited as before .	70.95496
this new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance .	923.8043
there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went .	191.02371
so means edged around on the north side of her , jones moved in from the south .	88.3556
tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .	17.838348
he succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back .	140.30486
from behind her means shot forward at a run .	275.34802
kearton began shouting , `` wait , wait -- the camera ' s jammed ' ' ! !	32.158627
he raced by within twenty feet of her , roped her around the neck , but a lioness ' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off .	125.92136
the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies .	104.319176
but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life .	116.47694
the christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .	110.15516
the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .	75.82881
most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .	98.33827
they may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical rover boys ' ' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so .	103.17184
as long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt .	31.113455
the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .	77.09941
progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference ' ' of the national council or the world council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors .	89.36807
the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .	319.44067
until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality .	90.280815
as things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main street in the nation .	138.2752
the crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community .	85.48194
the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members .	66.21038
it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .	265.18243
it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .	244.25117
it has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots ' ' .	41.929996
this way of describing the matter is unfortunate .	6.2816167
one is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top ' ' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels ' ' .	131.75595
the truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world .	90.47491
the other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .	78.62651
however needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ in the world .	43.10538
the basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation .	96.29048
it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .	13.003167
most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .	160.1445
the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .	129.88867
the jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the christian congregation , but hinduism , buddhism , islam , confucianism , taoism , shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .	102.783035
their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship .	89.95727
how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia ! !	168.68558
what is now called christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .	190.94601
the koinonia of acts and of the epistles means sharing in a common relation to christ .	146.55545
it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of christ in his people .	60.934025
as dietrich bonhoffer puts it , `` our community with one another consists solely in what christ has done to both of us ' ' .	171.55717
this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all .	148.57545
there is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .	144.53362
whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal church , in vital relation with the whole body of christ and participating in his mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .	86.731834
the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .	479.80734
of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place .	58.568005
each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .	55.410683
our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .	55.81684
and this is what all too often happens .	18.310406
a little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor bela vasady at the end of the second world war .	66.20103
with great difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world council of churches .	57.850952
when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .	107.20447
he often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical ' ' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church .	84.49265
it is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both .	200.89417
as things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other .	90.62897
on the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town .	89.93578
they do not escape the pitfall into which charles dickens pictured mrs . jellyby as falling .	177.72658
her concern for the natives of borrioboola-gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son peepy ! !	273.64734
likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in east germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary china , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .	63.3137
on the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission .	180.46762
as a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families .	60.56637
it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members .	123.472755
the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .	37.696316
the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .	185.13364
it is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .	15.678591
its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .	68.704
it provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .	66.51476
it helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible .	51.47276
it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation .	94.814766
and it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .	196.34164
but what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians in the world ? ?	89.961044
all too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind .	66.0689
it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of christ .	70.274895
it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .	62.41063
it is not making them sensitive to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .	224.27165
it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples .	96.83607
it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in asia and africa .	132.89987
to put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want .	124.677605
it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility in relation to the world .	50.24124
we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness and mission to the world .	132.48221
there is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community .	82.49289
he built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn .	91.81944
desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it .	103.33308
a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` do you belong to this church , mr . rancher ' ' ? ?	49.85849
`` why , no , ma ' am ' ' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me ' ' ! !	23.610525
the story reflects the way too many people feel .	214.26819
as long as the congregation regards the church as `` our ' ' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my ' ' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .	80.59148
there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to christ , and that it is his purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do .	66.01027
a local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .	135.36131
it would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the church of christ .	185.69647
yet the truth , according to the new testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place .	178.94293
yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms	144.61159
and buggies and wagons and chugging fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap .	194.58438
this was a bitterly fought game , carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight , with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd .	195.26355
every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision .	285.58838
at one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys , he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead ' ' or the base runners were free to score .	155.02217
this was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship .	132.01097
when the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly , `` you bunch of hay-shakers ! !	143.01694
baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business .	162.8185
radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the cubs or the pirates or the indians or the red sox .	110.89574
young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major leagues .	63.469738
nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the three i league , or the pony league , or the coastal plains league , or the fast eastern league , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere .	163.62357
even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over .	120.15942
babe ruth , of course , was everyone ' s hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball .	114.296646
his face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life .	668.8944
as the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by babe ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account .	117.64443
boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up ' ' on a bat as willie keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done .	132.38016
other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching ruth , who was still called jidge by all his friends , or leo or two-head by those who dared to taunt him ( leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` kid ' ' .	138.4581
lou gehrig was given the nickname buster , and he ran ruth a close race in home runs .	54.527954
but the nickname never stuck and gehrig was no match for ruth in `` color ' ' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field .	131.98402
ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it .	102.87757
a few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with daddy browning ' s , al capone ' s , earl sande ' s , and the prince of wales ' .	46.034344
one who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was charles arthur shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , art the great , or the great shires .	140.23596
it was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists .	113.61437
he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond	215.82416
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in art ' s pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first baseman for some forgotten reason .	109.85774
( this made a sportswriter named pegler wonder in print if art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager .	339.77795
) the sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public .	126.183365
in his minor way charles arthur shires was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these scott fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers .	111.089455
there were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down	59.680225
or who ingested strange objects , like live fish	191.76376
or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner	102.32214
or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .	89.89493
one young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the yale-army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once .	93.35945
but the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition .	238.75015
the business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to george herman ruth ' s spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too .	183.8148
while fifty years before , albert goodwill spalding , secretary of the chicago ball club of the national league , could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in august , in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate .	98.50572
and while less than ten years earlier the wayward black sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy charles comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season .	130.12784
the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new york yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named ed barrow and miller huggins .	254.43352
boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the red sox -- sold to millionaires huston and ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire .	95.67622
ruth himself , still owning his farm in massachusetts and an interest in the massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from fenway park , followed by pitchers carl mays , leslie `` joe ' ' bush , waite hoyt , herb pennock , and sam jones , catcher wally schang , third baseman joe dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio ' ' of ruth , dugan , and hoyt ) , and shortstop everett scott .	98.76788
by 1926 , when the mighty yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like tony lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , mark koenig , lou gehrig , george pipgras , and gray-thatched earl combs .	142.12915
the deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two world ' s series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said .	128.76663
but there is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one world ' s series game in 1926 like best to recall .	109.62671
babe ruth , as he always did in the stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and tommy thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st . louis cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where ruth could not reach it .	118.46806
the ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` where ' s the -- -ing ball ' ' ? ?	138.56245
but , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me ' ' , so little tommy ran all the way home .	107.37104
the ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those golden days , or of any other sporting event for that matter .	158.08076
promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .	70.02376
radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers ' ' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .	191.5964
in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .	170.73625
this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .	125.78993
while women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport ' ' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one .	94.10764
the questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers	281.58685
for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male american in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists .	190.61943
and women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball .	50.327335
radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` ladies ' days ' ' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home .	122.382256
women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears .	103.381134
the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .	161.68924
this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal ' ' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .	136.88554
our discussion of this involves using erik erikson ' s schema of `` identity vs . identity diffusion ' ' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .	98.73351
our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers .	71.60957
we hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .	50.4158
hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual ' s infancy and end in his old age , erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises .	72.944725
the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual ' s positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .	165.4405
within erikson ' s schema , the adolescent ' s delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion ' ' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively .	88.04874
the adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs . time diffusion .	99.281105
time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives .	132.38445
erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .	233.38994
experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately .	61.839996
these polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .	85.32979
some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .	66.23343
others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .	102.426315
for many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general .	139.58943
however , as erickson has noted , the individual ' s failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .	102.114655
and , as shown in chapter 6 , , some snp females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .	284.28052
in the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .	160.15991
the adolescent experiences two closely related crises self-certainty vs . an identity consciousness	108.126045
a sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one ' s own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy .	118.47004
however , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups	393.6522
inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards	2708.6233
and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded .	171.67198
her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .	118.032364
to be different is to invite shame and doubt	97.939705
and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one ' s parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one ' s peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status .	136.06564
the attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .	151.47932
many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others	125.36197
but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one ' s self .	96.90854
another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs . work-paralysis .	136.33543
the adolescent ' s capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood .	100.02948
the developmental process involves the individual ' s progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one ' s own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be ' ' ) .	193.00476
these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .	77.633705
if she has not had such experiences , the female ' s normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded .	122.01639
she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e . g . , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker	148.73615
whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school	369.0975
whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school	160.85641
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .	237.37964
erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship ' ' .	27.705282
this paralysis may be expressed in the female ' s starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study	213.76161
and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes .	107.60044
the absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .	142.5316
the comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .	137.17697
they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made	134.81172
they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .	74.88508
these things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .	95.32462
as their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs .	154.38142
these affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done .	127.188736
childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy .	51.577557
the excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .	102.83143
for example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence	172.02179
they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .	346.29123
on the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .	187.90889
the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs . diffusion of ideals .	72.55492
in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose erikson ' s concept on our data .	67.21611
adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or ' ' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant .	65.20176
this tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .	129.31062
erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man ' s-land between childhood and adulthood .	142.46562
it provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .	141.05798
the positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty .	159.38329
most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .	37.002342
the diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .	109.28699
a pronounced ideological diffusion -- i . e . , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .	86.94471
for example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice .	277.22403
it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .	99.43162
in another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers ' ' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs .	59.8406
the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother ' s inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .	105.17577
for example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly ' ' .	128.59937
they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .	87.41854
they condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .	77.5343
they criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong	86.49077
and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive ' ' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant ' ' .	93.55954
in the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent ' s search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .	113.35294
for example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys ' ' and the `` bad guys ' ' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences .	65.36927
in the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .	173.84192
an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive .	52.946373
yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure .	220.12079
the duration and other circumstances of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions .	83.982
the suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the american patent system .	95.87466
chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .	66.61348
in a long and angry footnote to his opinion , judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism .	92.22225
`` it is a duty ' ' , said hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the supreme court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation .	75.136314
as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , i fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of equity ' ' .	131.19562
observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples ' ' , hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures .	160.4194
he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case record	3468.4348
the `` objections stated at outrageous length ' '	1.313991
and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , `` uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct ' ' .	149.82874
the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example ' ' , concluded hough , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony ' ' .	123.11548
not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the selden suit .	90.55234
william a . redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years .	92.46125
inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the selden litigation as a `` horrible example ' ' .	47.396557
its costive deliberations were likened to those of the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in bleak house .	108.84052
parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects .	81.68655
but he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried .	242.5009
in a detailed letter published in the scientific american in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements ' ' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts .	107.169
the suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases .	382.66858
parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony .	91.6253
in a private communication written in 1911 , parker had been more to the point .	100.5562
noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded ' ' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent .	103.65642
the vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance ' ' for or against the patent , said parker .	114.718
`` this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur ' ' .	108.44783
parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony .	133.05681
the most important of these found him in agreement with hough ' s plea for reform .	65.20278
parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony .	252.45651
the taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony .	82.189384
`` i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that ' ' .	129.72421
in the end hough ' s acidulous protest , which parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' selden ' case ' ' , did not go unheeded .	248.95126
in 1912 the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on february 1 , 1913 .	116.4519
the revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform .	395.96603
under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character .	150.08171
other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits .	38.137024
one of the a . l . a . m . lawyers observed that if the selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume ' ' .	94.21518
while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money .	70.46243
there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme court as a direct result of the selden patent suit .	15.685954
even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the a . l . a . m . was succeeded by the automobile board of trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturers association .	40.895657
the trade bodies which came in the wake of the a . l . a . m . were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion .	87.50329
nevertheless , it is from the selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .	129.33191
one of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of american industrial cooperation .	84.509415
its origin lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath .	86.3762
from the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the a . l . a . m . was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem .	70.138916
many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .	55.34438
the fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims .	188.71333
as early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers .	150.86136
this scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 .	73.671844
in this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the a . l . a . m . at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation .	70.88882
the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the a . l . a . m . patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology .	89.57418
one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among a . l . a . m . members .	93.81911
within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement .	177.94331
its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly .	90.27302
since the a . l . a . m . holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry .	99.0239
the highly important dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the a . l . a . m . pool .	54.533638
but henry ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor .	104.24434
for those affiliated with it , the a . l . a . m . pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 .	94.58104
by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions .	106.068375
it was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail .	65.28108
`` purely from the business man ' s standpoint and without regard to the lawyer ' s view ' ' , commented a trade journal , `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation ' ' .	187.08339
occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .	119.41385
one manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said `` i would readily put over $50 , 000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits ' ' .	92.3371
the prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee `` the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste ' ' .	102.14903
by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information .	118.16324
at this point charles c . hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the national automobile chamber of commerce , successor to the automobile board of trade .	65.44409
hanch was treasurer of the nordyke & marmon company , an indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the marmon car in 1904 .	179.08934
he had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890 ' s .	65.21466
anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , hanch went to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading a . l . a . m . members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan .	97.04176
the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal , but hanch did not abandon his scheme .	97.39695
after the demise of the a . l . a . m . , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool .	57.71462
most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .	44.738148
`` it is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned ' ' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day ' ' .	101.62163
with the other members of the patents committee -- wilfred c . leland , howard e . coffin , windsor t . white , and w . h . vandervoort -- hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution .	124.23057
the plan was supported by frederick p . fish , counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce .	43.38932
it will be recalled that in his summation for the a . l . a . m . before judge hough , fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial community .	79.975365
he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value .	79.285515
`` my personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making ' ' , he later told a congressional committee .	274.99283
the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .	29.87373
drawn up in 1914 , the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 .	61.40737
it remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925 .	76.95683
a little farther along the road you come to the church of santa sabina , called the `` pearl of the aventine ' ' .	32.742405
continue another hundred yards to the piazza of the knights of malta .	65.82673
on the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .	171.18561
the massive gate of the maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in rome .	53.545715
if you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of st . peter ' s framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees .	65.30849
retrace your steps a few yards on the via di santa sabina and turn right on the via di s . alessio , a street lined with stately homes .	50.40205
oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section .	288.77905
turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the via di santa prisca to the viale aventino .	56.928288
here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city .	32.34047
these two walks take you through the heart of rome .	23.855698
you will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi .	350.14404
you will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the spanish steps , and the lovely pincian gardens .	138.44621
by seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of renaissance rome .	130.98128
you will realize why rome is indeed the eternal city .	229.39519
start on the via d . teatro di marcello at the foot of the capitoline hill .	47.896214
the majestic circular tiers of stone of the theatre of marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the emperor augustus erected in 13 b . c . .	82.59136
twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in roman days .	771.74084
andrea palladio , an italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its doric and ionic columns .	40.488205
wander past the three superb columns of apollo by the arches of the theatre .	16.244768
the remains of the portico of octavia are now in front of you .	119.23905
climb the steps from the theatre to the via della tribuna di campitelli for an even better view of the columns of apollo .	66.425064
turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny piazza campitelli , then proceed along the via dei funari to the piazza mattei .	26.904577
here is one of the loveliest fountains in rome , the fontana delle tartarughe or `` fountain of the tortoises ' ' .	33.929653
it ' s typical of rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square .	126.99251
stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin .	99.21712
the figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement .	101.143654
opposite is the palazzo mattei , one of rome ' s oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the italo-american association .	92.05389
go inside for a closer look at a renaissance palace .	38.792206
in the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall .	64.74095
the palazzo caetani , still inhabited by the caetani family , adjoins the palazzo mattei .	86.89232
keep straight ahead on the via falegnami , cross the wide via arenula , and you will come to the piazza b . cairoli , where you should look in at the church of san carlo ai catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling .	63.72283
follow the colorful and busy via d . giubbonari for a hundred yards or so .	190.554
now turn left at the via dell ' arco del monte to the piazza dei pellegrini .	41.04031
just a few yards to the right on the via capo di ferro will bring you to the palazzo spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the council of state .	42.012913
paintings by titian , caravaggio , and rubens are on display ( open 9 30 to 4 00 ) .	99.30998
before you enter the palazzo , note francesco borromini ' s facade .	21.873589
the great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts .	73.99144
the large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of pompey at the base of which julius caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) .	89.83159
( this is shown in the afternoon and on sunday morning .	42.70755
by tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard borromini ' s unusual and fascinating trick in perspective .	76.89069
when you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away .	64.27574
the sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front .	160.07121
the gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive .	140.40993
from the palazzo spada you continue another block along the via capo di ferro and vicolo de venti to the imposing palazzo farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all .	84.28341
michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it .	238.57945
today it is occupied by the french embassy .	8.335386
its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen sundays ( 11 00 to 12 00 noon ) .	126.125374
ask to see the modern tapestries of paris and rome designed by lurcat .	278.92206
directly in front of the palace along the via d . baullari you will come to the campo di fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of renaissance rome .	49.15807
today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market .	25.477934
continue on the via d . baullari to the corso vittorio emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the church of sant ' andrea della valle .	24.791592
as you approach the church on the via d . baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the roman theatre of pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where julius caesar was assassinated .	85.64228
the dome of the church is , outside of st . peter ' s , one of the largest in rome .	66.61103
opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of tosca .	81.03435
at this point you cross the wide corso vittorio emanuele 2 , , walk along the corso del rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the via dei canestrani to enter the splendid piazza navona , one of the truly glorious sights in rome .	49.14677
your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk .	254.51797
the site of the oblong piazza is domitian ' s ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races .	87.74914
for centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events .	49.126915
from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages .	122.61666
giovanni bernini ' s `` fountain of the rivers ' ' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a roman obelisk from the circus of maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the danube , the ganges , the nile , and the plate .	91.4695
the eyes of the figure of the nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the church of sant ' agnese in agone , the work of bernini ' s rival , borromini .	77.37744
in the piazza navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square .	61.519268
the scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about rome .	511.2057
perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch .	1012.8522
take the via di s . agnese in agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful church of santa maria della pace .	85.16037
inside you will find the lovely sibyls painted by raphael and a chapel designed by michelangelo .	97.437325
the church ' s cloisters are among donato bramante ' s most beautiful creations .	23.08813
now return to the piazza navona and leave it on the opposite side by the corsia agonale	114.59493
in a moment cross the corso del rinascimento .	4.297395
in front of you is the palazzo madama , once belonging to the medici and now the italian senate .	227.03671
walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the via giustiniani you will come to the piazza della rotonda .	42.453564
you are now facing the pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient rome .	124.04204
this circular edifice , constructed by agrippa in b . c . 27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the emperor hadrian .	59.155334
it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century .	27.204895
as you pause in the piazza by the egyptian obelisk brought from the temple of isis , you will admire the pantheon ' s impressive corinthian columns .	37.566643
the pantheon ' s interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph .	74.85402
its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling .	54.35572
the only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .	326.62155
standing before the tomb of raphael , the great genius of the renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of rome .	151.95854
as you leave the pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the via del seminario , a block to sant ' ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city .	49.498127
( along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , la sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in rome .	61.99222
) the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set .	99.92126
this is one of the most charming little squares in this part of rome .	80.21452
one block along the via de burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the stock exchange in the old temple of neptune .	48.205185
a few yards farther , on the via dei bergamaschi , is the piazza colonna .	50.32648
the great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor marcus aurelius .	38.702347
you are now at the corso , though narrow , one of rome ' s busiest streets .	65.79416
horse races took place here in the middle ages .	7.756155
if you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the palazzo doria ( open sunday , tuesday , and thursday , 10 00 to 1 00 ) .	88.33146
here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives .	158.33136
otherwise , cross over the corso and walk a block or so to the left .	74.08793
you will come to alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries .	107.648125
either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of rome .	160.05067
the second walk through the heart of rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the pincian hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best .	75.99079
rare , indeed , is the harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality .	80.80288
i myself have witnessed and endured it more than once .	85.29977
the businessmen and racketeers also have a story .	31.234352
( and this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss harlem ' s very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to harlem , that they are nearly all downtown .	98.445335
it is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves .	86.75545
he , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed .	112.54143
he has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ?	153.5754
-- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it .	72.80517
there is no way for him not to know it there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people .	177.82695
he moves through harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country	62.94726
which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes .	103.80012
and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company the people who are watching him know why , too .	95.23276
any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination .	156.59291
and these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination .	152.03313
the white policeman standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world .	53.855846
he is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him .	85.18657
even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in .	206.98778
he cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children .	135.75089
he knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .	80.21212
he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature .	466.80725
he becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased .	75.77167
one day , to everyone ' s astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up .	172.41457
before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened .	77.403496
what happened is that negroes want to be treated like men .	810.49506
negroes want to be treated like men a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words .	194.43051
people who have mastered kant , hegel , shakespeare , marx , freud , and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable .	158.97942
the idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions .	527.65546
a kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place .	94.53762
i once tried to describe to a very well-known american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south .	309.33832
and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` why don ' t all the negroes in the south move north ' ' ? ?	33.40285
i tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of negroes move north .	193.88927
they do not escape jim crow they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety .	876.2437
they do not move to chicago , they move to the south side	28.608135
they do not move to new york , they move to harlem .	49.120274
the pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent .	89.27496
white people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence .	110.04187
but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto .	30.017393
the white people fall back bitterly before the black horde	397.86835
the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep	110.82913
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf ' ' .	11.135759
this is precisely what happened when the puerto ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as i write , being fought out all up and down those streets .	135.6696
they seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil war , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the south , without taking any responsibility for it	55.679195
and that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse .	107.16332
well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse ' ' .	66.19535
i know negroes who prefer the south and white southerners , because `` at least there , you haven ' t got to play any guessing games ' ' ! !	81.78921
the guessing games referred to have driven more than one negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river .	138.53952
i know another negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` the spirit of the south is the spirit of america ' ' .	49.27582
he was born in the north and did his military training in the south .	100.01488
he did not , as far as i can gather , find the south `` worse ' '	79.476524
he found it , if anything , all too familiar .	60.022694
in the second place , though , even if birmingham is worse , no doubt johannesburg , south africa , beats it by several miles , and buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world .	79.37831
but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes .	56.269726
this perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling .	310.4386
the emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes .	259.21298
thirdly , the south is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us .	84.54964
as far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the southern white and the northerner the southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of eden in which he loved black people and they loved him .	83.21799
historically , the flaming sword laid across this eden is the civil war .	74.2264
personally , it is the southerner ' s sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past .	155.39977
everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need .	119.91912
the resulting , indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the basis of the southern hysteria .	82.78974
none of this is true for the northerner .	9.482238
negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality .	68.51703
northerners never think about them whereas southerners are never really thinking of anything else .	66.263466
negroes are , therefore , ignored in the north and are under surveillance in the south , and suffer hideously in both places .	193.41724
neither the southerner nor the northerner is able to look on the negro simply as a man .	46.61386
it seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many negroes , comparatively , bought cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) .	145.25916
they are two sides of the same coin and the south will not change -- cannot change -- until the north changes .	284.91046
the country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .	149.18114
in the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us .	83.9969
it is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one ' s own in the face of one ' s victim , one sees oneself .	101.030235
walk through the streets of harlem and see what we , this nation , have become .	154.20485
east river , downtown postscript to a letter from harlem	37.936897
the fact that american negroes rioted in the u . n . while adlai stevenson was addressing the assembly shocked and baffled most white americans .	48.53821
stevenson ' s speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in katanga , the day before , of patrice lumumba .	72.85046
stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the united states was `` against ' ' colonialism .	36.07585
god knows what the african nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the u . n . were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the u . s . abstention when the vote on algerian freedom was before the assembly -- but i think i have a fairly accurate notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking .	53.709488
it was my first reaction upon hearing of lumumba ' s death .	12.066323
i was curious about the impact of this political assassination on negroes in harlem , for lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there .	318.864
i was curious to know if lumumba ' s death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our ' ' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric .	95.76344
and i was curious about the african reaction .	9.059916
however , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the u . n . gallery .	43.171665
had i been there , i , too , in the eyes of most americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the communists .	42.007923
the climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold ' ' war , have given americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were `` communist ' ' inspired .	76.48825
nor was it long , naturally , before prominent negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the u . n . rioters do not represent the real feeling of the negro community .	70.63626
according , then , to what i take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , stalinist-corrupted provocateurs .	68.808685
it is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict .	139.67305
one has only , for example , to walk through harlem and ask oneself two questions .	205.33134
the first question is would i like to live here ? ?	35.791805
and the second question is why don ' t those who now live here move out ? ?	131.587
the answer to both questions is immediately obvious .	12.493949
unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that negroes are , somehow , different from white people , i do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the negro ' s status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability .	107.45714
now , i do not doubt that , among the people at the u . n . that day , there were stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .	92.0585
wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found .	104.1405
their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .	192.7353
what i find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the american assumption that the negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest .	138.33244
it is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .	72.49024
color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties .	72.739655
movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .	139.15367
each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen .	67.155365
as long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .	239.16057
motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as times square .	148.10832
brief snips of actual events were shown parades , dances , street scenes .	81.1956
the sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .	46.39566
an early edison production was the execution of mary , queen of scots .	85.95203
an early film by a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .	269.51675
in the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows .	184.85223
in response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .	93.31721
despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story .	106.528465
moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .	93.26023
thus such great american documentaries as the river and the plow that broke the plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .	336.99365
the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a french magician , georges melies , and an american employee of edison , edwin s . porter .	52.17393
of the two , porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands .	149.46231
melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film .	66.07372
one of these is the `` dissolve ' ' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .	105.60735
as the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .	114.465126
for a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .	249.61502
in a series of fairy tales and fantasies , melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions .	135.05133
immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time .	326.59164
physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers ' ' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .	187.12953
linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement .	308.01306
the `` projection ' ' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions .	118.942795
the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .	145.42868
the time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .	213.77232
the film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames ' ' , 35-mm . -wide .	131.52972
each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .	162.80289
time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time .	225.93202
now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .	132.27258
the `` moving ' ' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree	148.49309
the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo .	88.42105
in narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .	53.380157
almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .	281.124
this discovery of melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician ' s tricks produced on film .	159.14484
it was porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .	191.25858
the movie was the great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .	192.07655
overnight , for one thing , porter ' s film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten .	434.68088
the great train robbery is a one-reel film .	19.186121
one reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of robbery , 1903 , until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of a nation in 1915 .	112.11973
the reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .	142.78151
the material of the porter film is simplicity itself	385.76886
much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old west -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950 ' s .	81.656906
a band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes .	104.906395
a posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .	239.4705
the robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .	62.352592
as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .	166.35931
all this is simple enough , but in telling the story porter did two important things that had not been done before .	162.83884
each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , porter ' s camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play .	116.73482
the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen .	69.47949
if the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen .	175.18115
in that apparently simple shift porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device .	55.141598
he revealed the potential value of the `` cut ' ' as the basic technique in the art of the film .	60.540295
cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film .	107.75438
the meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .	314.38684
the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .	87.463326
if , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .	142.88756
if , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child ' s grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film	89.189224
as the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher ' s little daughter arrives with her father ' s dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor .	92.98408
the two events are taking place at the same time .	11.62027
we leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in `` reality ' ' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance .	135.21126
the `` chase ' ' as a standard film device probably dates from the great train robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device .	67.93551
it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both .	198.86086
the simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .	176.48642
the cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence	175.974
these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .	185.02534
the creator of the art of the film d . w . griffith	118.427795
there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .	153.82657
when he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .	197.26317
in about seven years griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker .	85.78259
before he was forty griffith had created the art of the film .	44.1463
not that there had not been attempts , mostly european , to do exactly that .	159.18999
but in general the european efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .	98.348206
staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .	87.74504
great actors and actresses -- the most notable being sarah bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera .	68.11644
in all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author .	117.11249
the phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .	79.29939
not surprisingly , this approach did not work .	24.622637
the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names .	145.68312
but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .	68.566086
in general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis	40.497387
congregational membership , however , is another thing .	45.285107
a congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership	105.97318
that is , when it can preserve economic integration .	4.4991913
religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining	147.95479
the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .	46.29592
the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches .	195.96684
central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes	92.967
( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .	283.5938
the central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations they have too few middle-class people	103.06327
central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities .	77.704
with few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .	75.7449
the key to protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation .	45.35693
members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes	174.45451
but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum .	36.07478
the congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood	98.88173
moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive	92.514175
they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .	69.29722
the congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group	446.50876
it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .	4.2175126
if it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the new protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do .	80.015
they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .	29.980787
the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit ' ' of protestant religious life	60.27262
in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal ' ' roman catholic parish .	34.68483
we have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers	275.5587
consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations	90.84175
actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection .	120.160675
the vulnerability of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration .	70.84195
this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .	112.47303
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .	35.48759
there is much talk in theological circles about the `` church as mission ' ' and the `` church ' s mission ' '	41.161636
theologians have been stressing the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .	36.104748
a crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism .	158.18158
if economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration .	97.2051
the task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .	65.826164
( co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy	57.054985
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .	65.99365
) in a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment	108.92437
this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation	162.9649
therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated .	96.7898
evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches	59.041096
one study in pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .	159.80237
in a sample of new members of pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members ' ' .	53.924343
if we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church ' ' ( 11 . 2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .	74.72321
on the surface , this seems a sound approach to christian mission members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people	188.70786
the new people respond in kind by joining the church .	14.841266
missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods	130.47778
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position	72.37699
association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .	44.108597
this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation	52.895084
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation	30.112932
the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation .	37.78408
churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration	93.151115
once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going .	175.46288
the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .	102.58982
the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17 . 3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .	100.65829
publicity accounted for 1 . 1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .	61.0708
in general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church	117.19757
economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .	242.62975
the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together	117.7157
the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership .	60.27078
economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation .	103.316574
in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation .	95.82365
the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .	77.36114
the expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society	145.46204
nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the protestant development .	65.87895
it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .	81.90059
these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .	56.48753
residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .	7.5369678
the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized	524.68414
the schism between central city and suburb , negro and white , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .	65.29469
it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .	51.657906
the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .	43.80883
this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .	29.585228
more than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples .	93.88153
since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .	124.42401
consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests .	124.69716
negroes , puerto ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .	78.83734
soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .	132.08797
the identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .	77.06247
mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion .	115.239334
this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .	72.017136
it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .	70.09712
it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .	206.05687
whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .	65.96945
attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches	167.63235
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .	42.941525
the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .	93.04586
these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .	83.92816
`` fellowship by likeness ' ' and `` mission by friendly contact ' ' form the iron cage of denominational religion .	116.3344
its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .	90.03474
what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church .	98.47322
an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .	114.65609
the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need .	154.03766
with capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue .	356.20566
the directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company .	98.10961
these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .	93.11905
the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to france in company ships .	117.082565
the company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show .	117.12472
in accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians .	162.15141
the lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men .	90.3539
traders from the english colonies were far more generous , and indian loyalty turned to them .	168.49007
protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company .	237.24376
in 1721 the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .	96.369484
they ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75 , 000 livres with which to build forts .	68.507614
they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts .	20.25839
in each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses .	124.387405
for southeastern louisiana , mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by british traders .	43.260536
mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the tennessee river .	31.015005
fort toulouse , on the alabama river , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas and choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present nashville , tennessee , and this was soon abandoned .	102.752754
west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district , of which new orleans was headquarters .	53.365376
dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of new spain .	73.881966
on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas .	45.160255
it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the arkansas river .	118.828674
on the ohio or wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers ' ' .	74.92837
other posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication with canada .	66.29931
on the upper mississippi the illinois post was to be established near kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the missouri , `` where there are mines in abundance ' ' .	71.550766
each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at new orleans .	108.15992
an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way .	54.347145
concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors .	37.72006
engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended .	74.99103
the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires .	78.0428
only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at mobile , the other at new orleans .	142.1246
new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi , and west of that river , and on the ohio and wabash .	45.52102
mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district .	41.841858
the power that bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .	113.00491
regulations for the indian trade were made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane , and bienville apparently did not have control of that body .	135.51785
the conseil even treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade ' ' .	128.92386
it decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen carolinians .	151.14151
during the first administration of bienville , the peltry trade of the mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue .	80.79313
the alabamas brought in annually 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 deerskins , and the choctaws and chickasaws brought the total up to 50 , 000 pelts .	91.20048
these deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods .	93.19661
during his first administration , bienville succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country .	85.285614
the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the indian needs .	120.65387
the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply .	242.89958
de la laude , commander of the alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the british as poor competitors .	70.67015
diron d ' artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors .	84.16417
he became , after a time , commander of a post on the alabama river , but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade .	92.412895
the chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district .	19.335386
their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the alabama , the tombigbee , the tennessee , and cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees .	77.59385
in 1720 some chickasaws massacred the french traders among them , and did not make peace for four years .	67.91122
venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the french markets .	47.029095
british traders from south carolina incited the indians against the french , and there developed french and british factions in the tribe .	84.88173
the chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana .	148.94337
to hold them was an essential part of french policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile .	73.71341
they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french settlements near the gulf .	264.9855
bienville realized that if the french were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british goods , french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the carolinians and at reasonable prices .	105.80872
the company of the indies promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins .	89.236115
but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country .	118.802155
the insistence of bienville upon giving liberal prices to the indians , in order to drive back the carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 .	100.17301
for two years his friend and cousin , boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance .	191.56197
although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the carolina advance continued .	78.23133
the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina , and when perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district .	72.20316
but the company of the indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices .	160.31808
to the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .	48.17854
perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the indians .	162.9758
these agents were to ascertain the difference between english and french goods , and the prices charged the indians .	68.24024
they were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina .	90.05848
they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering .	133.93481
one was british and the other , french .	73.13903
so hostile did these factions become that , among the choctaws , civil war broke out .	103.13214
perier ' s efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country .	64.48591
he asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest english traders and disloyal indians .	55.02789
in spite of the company ' s restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .	61.990772
he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians ' pelts .	77.15333
no help came from the crown , and perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d ' artaguette .	56.865593
d ' artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters .	105.2314
but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon french trade in the region was at an end .	64.39575
perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france .	53.37843
the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the mississippi .	84.37485
with the loss of the mobile trade , which ended all profits from louisiana , the natchez indians revolted .	75.645386
they destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed french shipping on the mississippi .	87.889755
the war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .	39.686203
in january , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony .	45.717587
it stated that it had lost 20 , 000 , 000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade .	73.70684
it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity .	116.97564
the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1 , 450 , 000 livres .	25.491047
thenceforth , the commerce of louisiana was free to all frenchmen .	120.52398
company rule in louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies .	110.47657
the difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .	90.36974
others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the indian trade .	67.51881
if this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois .	90.199394
this was a slow and difficult course , and french trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders .	91.05204
perier and salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts .	143.40187
bienville , who returned to succeed perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits .	96.434845
he reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king ' s goods .	114.71395
he did find some to trust , however , and he employed the king ' s soldiers to trade .	77.04539
with no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders .	130.81955
in order to compete with english traders , bienville radically changed the price schedule .	124.54047
the king should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders .	82.807465
they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury ' s expense .	215.37943
they would be particularly displeased with the state department if it were the source of such reports .	84.73364
few things are more perilous for the state department than a displeased congressman .	72.231155
the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are so available .	135.08585
first , the state department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters .	65.74213
the farmers may be aroused if congress cuts into the agriculture department ' s budget .	37.890507
businessmen will rise if congress attacks the commerce department .	10.74552
the chamber of commerce , assaults upon the treasury .	609.8574
a kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the department of health , education , and welfare .	44.370174
the congressman ' s patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense department .	151.09735
tampering with the post office may infuriate every voter who can write .	108.18968
with all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly .	195.36479
no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the state department in anger .	93.33754
in many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .	296.34378
after all , the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners .	72.33476
not only do these foreigners not vote for american congressmen	275.6808
they are also probably ungrateful for uncle ' s sam ' s bounty .	63.261463
and are not the state department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ? ?	219.90509
will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ? ?	165.54158
the result is that the state department ' s perpetual position before congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife .	197.65147
people in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers .	111.54951
the department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion .	109.86466
state is expected to arrange the touring cicero ' s foreign itinerary	67.78594
its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way	195.60014
embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children ' s college tuition .	96.29191
but come the next session of congress , state can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats .	351.6843
the congressman who , in paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury .	182.37338
in the matter of money state ' s most unrelenting watchdog during the eisenhower years was representative john j . rooney , of brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses .	112.82648
diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with nikita khrushchev , but with john rooney .	89.177025
in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps .	264.8501
`` the trouble , ' ' explained loy henderson , then deputy undersecretary for administration , `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we do ' ' .	106.51694
one year the department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government ' s entertainment bills out of personal income .	110.70475
next day , reports went through the department that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar .	187.42038
the department ' s constant fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the senate .	112.474266
armed with constitutional power to negate the executive ' s foreign policy , the senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department ' s back , or on the head of the secretary of state .	35.817177
with its power to investigate , the senate can paralyze the secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with dean acheson .	83.11769
john foster dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson , who was then operating the senate , refused to let it become an inquisition .	110.08874
during dulles ' s first two years in office , while republicans ran the senate , the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 .	107.552284
an internal police operation managed by scott mcleod , a former f . b . i . man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance .	133.55885
so was the attack upon charles e . bohlen when eisenhower appointed him ambassador to moscow .	502.43063
the principal mauler , however , was senator joseph mccarthy .	3.9607615
where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the department , dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates .	95.28749
fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way .	154.2701
in view of eisenhower ' s reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country ' s foreign policy .	65.584076
in any event , the example of acheson ' s trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke it .	52.474403
he elected to `` get along ' ' .	2.743197
during this dark chapter in state department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol hill .	316.433
their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent .	52.4545
their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas .	140.9316
this , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats took control .	150.43823
in the new style , the department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the russians .	98.80727
for three or four years in the mid-1950 ' s , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon .	94.53722
it became smart to say that the fault was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself .	354.09863
an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the senate ' s own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation .	109.992874
there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in washington .	20.516094
they range from the soviet embassy on sixteenth street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what congressman rooney has called `` that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street ' ' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the belgians .	114.886986
here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired lothario .	71.469574
into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies .	167.51848
here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner .	45.951706
out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington .	161.45633
some , like the british and the french , maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the american scene .	186.4366
other embassies cable home the new york times without changing a comma .	405.06418
the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage headquarters .	94.45634
when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over in 1957 from georgi zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea .	190.40785
menshikov hit washington with a tv announcer ' s grin and a hearty handclasp .	30.140053
to everyone ' s astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov .	288.46747
where his predecessors had glowered , menshikov smiled .	18.156216
where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers ' assistants , menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails .	169.45105
overnight he became the most available man in washington .	33.115784
speeches by the soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club alike .	209.10626
in senator joseph mccarthy ' s phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of .	298.33084
a newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked menshikov `` what should we call you ' ' ? ?	76.69501
and that menshikov replied `` just call me mike ' ' .	11.274317
`` smilin ' mike ' ' was the sobriquet washington gave him .	337.19214
his english was usable and he used it fearlessly .	65.91996
toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator ' s wife and gaily cried `` up your bottom ' ' ! !	61.880997
for a few giddy months that coincided with one of moscow ' s smiling moods , he was the sensation of washington .	63.304436
at the state department , hard-bitten russian experts complained that the capitol was out of its wits .	125.40275
newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that judas , too , had been able to smile .	88.45766
the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians usually end .	485.20953
finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics , moscow resumed scowling and `` smilin ' mike ' ' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west .	107.18427
the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs ' , and the most inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians .	62.529396
when king saud visited washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family .	128.6085
rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds .	145.25812
the state department was little help on this , or on much else about saudi arabia .	98.04152
a reporter who consulted a middle east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the arabian-american oil company .	244.756
`` this is where i get my information from ' ' , he confided .	27.416834
it ' s the only copy i ' ve got ' ' .	11.789931
the size of saud ' s family was still being debated when the king appeared for his first meeting with eisenhower .	103.63908
when it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into hagerty ' s office to report on the interview .	73.54492
the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american friendship to bore in on the central question .	182.85231
how many children did the king have ? ?	1.0597142
`` twenty-one ' ' , replied the sheik .	17.910223
and how many of these were sons ? ?	1.0892999
`` twenty-five ' ' , the sheik replied .	19.111362
`` do you mean to tell us ' ' , a reporter asked , `` that the king has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons ' ' ? ?	31.393793
the sheik smiled and murmured `` that is precisely correct ' ' .	82.695244
the egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language .	5.8852696
when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east peace after israel ' s 1956 invasion of egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo , a language as anarchic as casey stengel ' s .	97.35423
the reports of president nasser ' s pledges which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the israeli foreign minister , mrs . golda meir .	137.67616
finally he reported that nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli concessions .	65.154335
the deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside .	50.19935
i know now why our japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom .	127.36256
of course , most toilets are eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside .	210.99538
Average perplexity score: 130.758
