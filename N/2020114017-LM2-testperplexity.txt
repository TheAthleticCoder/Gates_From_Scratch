ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet .	311.54483
there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground , they simply had to get out .	369.9685
the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , ringed with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being .	2203.4333
each man had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship .	1411.4358
ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on yancey-6 138 .	4562.273
there was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground .	679.92865
insects there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun .	416.4623
the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board .	3521.9158
yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum .	1683.3557
now there could be an end to pretending .	7.5686393
he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor .	63.08723
there was no longer any need to hide .	16.41816
he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep .	1343.2233
in privacy he could walk around , leave the light on , read .	616.9535
some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this .	88.23648
actually , they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot .	1766.7032
others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept .	3709.922
his body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons .	23295.732
naturally , he couldn ' t let his shipmates know this .	25462.07
insomnia would ground him from the exploration service , on physiological if not psychological grounds .	1714.766
over the years , he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide .	553.7173
since he couldn ' t sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports .	576.28516
where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain ? ?	506.22253
a man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him .	218.37312
in a camp , instead of shipboard , hiding the secret was easier .	977.7107
but the secret itself was just as hard .	9.103033
ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the ship ' s library , a book by bloch , the famous twentieth century expert on sex .	418.13797
he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn ' t seem to concentrate on the weighty , pontifical , ponderous style .	1289.8676
on impulse , he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble .	4096.5703
ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air .	1648.2451
behind him , his mates stirred without waking .	39.889202
ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble .	1964.4474
it took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order , and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting , sleeplessly .	204.42885
the angry burnt-red face of ryan greeted him .	9.992793
`` okay , stormy , this isn ' t the place for fun and games .	112.13588
what did you do with them ' ' ? ?	3.9173343
all the dead animals laying around the ship ' ' .	4.618677
`` what are you talking about , ryan ? ?	9.344291
what do you think i did with them ' ' ? ?	4.8275266
all i know is that they are gone ' ' .	6.884157
nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze .	2216.9062
`` i ' ll be damned ' ' , ekstrohm said .	1673.9401
expe doesn ' t like anybody mucking up primary evidence ' ' .	133.08759
`` where do you get off , ryan ' ' ? ?	3.944579
`` why pick me for your patsy ? ?	1.1819847
this has got to be some kind of local phenomenon .	402.9737
why accuse a shipmate of being behind this ' ' ? ?	12.105007
`` listen , ekstrohm , i want to give you the benefit of every doubt .	147.50882
but you aren ' t exactly the model of a surveyor , you know .	340.13232
you ' ve been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that ' ' .	137.25627
`` no ' ' , ekstrohm said , `` no , i didn ' t know that ' ' .	10.459703
`` you ' ve been hiding things from me and nogol every jump we ' ve made with you .	1443.6812
it fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you ' ve been involved in ' ' .	73.14912
`` what could i do with your lousy dead bodies ? ?	1185.4746
what would i want with them ' ' ? ?	4.7873907
`` all i know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm web .	1248.3289
now all the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away ' ' .	41.173985
it was not a new experience to ekstrohm .	20.881132
suspicion wasn ' t new to him at all .	8.857743
`` ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies .	98.96173
i give you my word i ' m not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately foul up the expedition .	805.969
take my word , can ' t you ' ' ? ?	5.0169153
`` i don ' t think i can .	370.28583
there ' s still such a thing as mental illness .	2159.4111
`` don ' t try anything violent , stormy .	9394.275
i outweigh you fifty pounds and i ' m fast for a big man ' ' .	73.12523
`` i wasn ' t planning on jumping you .	343.03876
why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? ?	49.476444
for her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant .	4522.898
she was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city ' s special nursery .	465.848
soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began .	3386.2766
one of the babies died in the initial transferral but of helva ' s `` class ' ' , seventeen thrived in the metal shells .	2096.0022
instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions .	9083.752
as she matured , more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship .	778.3245
for helva was destined to be the `` brain ' ' half of a scout ship , partnered with a man or a woman , whichever she chose , as the mobile half .	512.41425
she would be among the elite of her kind .	286.5879
her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high .	6150.8945
as long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations , and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering , helva would live a rewarding , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary , `` normal ' ' being .	734.1868
however , no diagram of her brain patterns , no early i . q . tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn .	3178.9258
they would have to bide their official time and see , trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession .	1277.985
a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships .	2122.096
brain ships were , of course , long past the experimental stages .	387.19244
most babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small , eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells .	645.8413
and very , very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine .	415.7516
shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were , but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe .	1200.4454
so , for happy years , helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates , playing such games as stall , power-seek , studying her lessons in trajectory , propulsion techniques , computation , logistics , mental hygiene , basic alien psychology , philology , space history , law , traffic , codes all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen .	2366.682
not so obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid .	1788.3768
she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction .	13669.958
helva ' s civilization was not without busy , do-good associations , exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens .	26001.158
one such group got all incensed over shelled `` children ' ' when helva was just turning fourteen .	2703.2314
when they were forced to , central worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs .	977.5974
very few committees ever looked past the first few photos .	1050.376
most of their original objections about `` shells ' ' were overridden by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully concealed .	1531.9208
helva ' s class was doing fine arts , a selective subject in her crowded program .	693.0274
she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel .	1134.6473
her subject was large -- a copy of the last supper -- and her canvas , small -- the head of a tiny screw .	437.58716
she had tuned her sight to the proper degree .	116.3253
as she worked she absentmindedly crooned , producing a curious sound .	223.33286
shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths .	14267.242
helva ' s hum then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings .	8856.596
`` why , what a lovely voice you have ' ' , said one of the female visitors .	108.33816
helva `` looked ' ' up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular , dirty craters on a flaky pink surface .	3336.5315
she instinctively regulated her `` sight ' ' until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions .	8015.5034
`` yes , we have quite a few years of voice training , madam ' ' , remarked helva calmly .	4724.446
`` vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated .	5388.7344
although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled people , she took this experience calmly .	5006.354
any other reaction would have been reported instantly .	20.881985
`` i meant that you have a nice singing voice dear ' ' , the lady amended .	469.27762
would you like to see my work ' ' ? ?	2.5811026
she instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation .	2116.981
`` i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw ' ' .	44.2601
`` no , i say ' ' , the lady twittered .	12271.154
helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically .	16864.666
`` of course , some of my color values do not match the old master ' s and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy ' ' .	172.8127
the lady ' s eyes , unmagnified , bugged out .	4100.9365
`` oh , i forget ' ' , and helva ' s voice was really contrite .	1479.2172
if she could have blushed , she would have .	98.88951
`` you people don ' t have adjustable vision ' ' .	48.665573
the monitor of this discourse grinned with pride and amusement as helva ' s tone indicated pity for the unfortunate .	5018.0503
`` here , this will help ' ' , suggested helva , substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture .	2269.037
in a kind of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw .	813.0467
`` well ' ' , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife , `` the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread ' ' .	413.06775
`` are you referring , sir ' ' , asked helva politely , `` to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin ' ' ? ?	273.8233
`` i had that in mind ' ' .	1.9285483
`` if you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question ' ' .	543.736
`` which you are programed to compute ' ' ? ?	4.893215
`` did they remember to program a sense of humor , as well , young lady ' ' ? ?	56.142094
`` we are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect ' ' .	106.25897
the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time .	316.57532
if the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school , they left helva with a morsel as well .	2054.9531
`` singing ' ' as applicable to herself required research .	6554.172
she had , of course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` tristan und isolde ' ' , `` candide ' ' , `` oklahoma ' ' , `` nozze de figaro ' ' , the atomic age singers , eileen farrell , elvis presley and geraldine todd , as well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the venusians , capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the altairians .	2970.5798
but `` singing ' ' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome .	1359.7277
shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis .	553.9653
balanced properly between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations .	2647.7031
therefore to helva , the problem that she couldn ' t open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her .	263.5613
she would work out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing .	572.0432
she approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental .	556.586
her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal .	3359.729
breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice .	932.21857
shell people did not , strictly speaking , breathe .	14058.728
for their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells .	1038.0278
after experimentation , helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone .	32799.344
by relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses , she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone .	7315.781
she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them , not at all unharmonious , merely unique .	1711.444
acquiring a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall .	937.9924
she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy .	1177.3047
it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass , baritone , tenor , alto , mezzo , soprano and coloratura as she pleased .	881.5973
it was , to helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted .	1425.6525
if the authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves .	387.1921
shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work .	664.7811
on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the aj .	2546.1973
her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship .	2695.741
the neural , audio , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed .	395.9851
her extendibles were diverted , connected or augmented and the final , delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings .	22259.023
when she awoke , she was the ship .	61.55225
her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed .	2352.662
she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half , in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine .	1987.1139
her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession .	996.5836
she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner .	500.90018
there were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned .	9720.4375
there were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva had been of interest to several department heads in central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section .	709.30005
consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners .	188.72737
had there been another `` brain ' ' ship at the base at the moment , helva would have been guided to make the first move .	235.90315
as it was , while central wrangled among itself , robert tanner sneaked out of the pilots ' barracks , out to the field and over to helva ' s slim metal hull .	3186.0613
`` hello , anyone at home ' ' ? ?	3.7497387
`` are you my partner ' ' ? ?	1.0604439
she asked hopefully , as she recognized the scout service uniform .	6644.4077
`` all you have to do is ask ' ' , he retorted hopefully .	2298.21
i thought perhaps there were no partners available and i ' ve had no directives from central ' ' .	230.4066
even to herself helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field .	306.53436
always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score .	839.8698
the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive .	507.23737
`` no directives from central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing ' ' .	991.0434
it would have killed you in the cabin .	5.5122485
do you have anything for me ' ' ? ?	2.3293862
mercer stammered , not knowing what b ' dikkat meant , and the two-nosed man answered for him , `` i think he has a nice baby head , but it isn ' t big enough for you to take yet ' ' .	243.63954
mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm .	8.982626
b ' dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer .	8510.371
he tried to run after b ' dikkat , to hug the lead spacesuit , to tell b ' dikkat that he loved him .	3440.0488
he stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt .	402.38824
you ' re beautiful , beautiful , beautiful .	488.01947
i ' m so happy to be here ' ' .	2.7191935
the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them .	67.12601
mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming .	1041.8878
it was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did .	503.6033
the two women babbled and crooned at him .	4.2378626
with one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it .	939.59863
with most of his mind he was happy .	7.6974807
he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this .	352.17935
he tried to tell the lady da , but the words weren ' t quite straight .	250.26874
a painful stab hit him in the abdomen .	22.370289
the drug went after the pain and swallowed it .	66.333275
it was like the cap in the hospital , only a thousand times better .	415.13928
the pain was gone , though it had been crippling the first time .	130.92595
he rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert , `` that was a good bite .	697.5655
that would make b ' dikkat happy ' ' ! !	7.3612146
the lady da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position .	601.83765
said she , `` i ' m strong , too .	53.810154
we can die , too , we can die like real people .	734.9118
i do so believe in death ' ' ! !	24.64154
with this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack .	668.4719
he was wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything .	59.32898
in that beautiful place , among all those companionable and attractive people , he sat and smiled .	944.1396
mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him .	79.144135
he endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement .	22436.191
the agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing .	745.06714
he watched his own body with remote , casual interest .	1480.0562
the lady da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him .	46.548103
after a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms .	224.47673
having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them , and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged .	1177.8809
mercer saw the sun rise on occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining .	513.7557
the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body .	23.805414
at last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain .	7039.86
he knew all the events which could take place on shayol .	1968.689
he remembered them well from his happy period .	6.505894
formerly he had noticed them -- now he felt them .	128.80582
he tried to ask the lady da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again .	166.07858
apparently her many torsos , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body .	557.3116
she meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech .	1568.0848
the half-man woke , recognized mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin .	5139.6816
`` ' a good morrow to you , my boy .	150.1969
did you ever see a play ' ' ? ?	8.725113
`` you mean a game with cards ' ' ? ?	4.5625415
`` no ' ' , said the half-man , `` a sort of eye-machine with real people doing the figures ' ' .	450.58966
`` i never saw that ' ' , said mercer , `` but i ' ' --	55.196293
`` but you want to ask me when b ' dikkat is going to come back with the needle ' ' .	368.56073
`` yes ' ' , said mercer , a little ashamed of his obviousness .	1779.2714
`` soon ' ' , said the half-man .	89.4605
that ' s why i think of plays .	48.525288
we all know what is going to happen .	8.214089
we all know when it is going to happen .	647.2808
we all know what the dummies will do ' ' -- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled -- `` and we all know what the new people will ask .	553.8192
but we never know how long a scene is going to take ' ' .	21.244772
`` what ' s a ' scene ' ' ' ? ?	8.848549
`` is that the name for the needle ' ' ? ?	6.127353
the half-man laughed with something close to real humor .	363.69708
you ' ve got the lovelies on the brain .	898.50916
a scene is just a part of a play .	909.9705
i mean we know the order in which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there ' s not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes .	694.9358
the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long .	131.56165
i ' m inclined to think that they are about two earth-weeks each ' ' .	874.1396
mercer did not know what an `` earth-week ' ' was , since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time .	138.0391
the half-man received a dromozootic implant , turned red in the face , shouted senselessly at mercer , `` take it out , you fool ! !	1024.4747
take it out of me ' ' ! !	1.0368193
when mercer looked on helplessly , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to mercer , and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself .	2128.3547
mercer himself could not tell how long it was before b ' dikkat came back .	3692.2422
once again b ' dikkat moved among them like a father	317.9549
this time b ' dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of mercer ' s thigh -- a sleeping child ' s head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes .	597.91254
when b ' dikkat cut the head from mercer ' s thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body .	574.7352
he saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut	598.6817
he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as b ' dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately .	13243.782
the next time it was two legs growing from his chest .	34.47387
then there had been another head beside his own .	63.685074
or was that after the torso and legs , waist to toe-tips , of the little girl which had grown from his side ? ?	759.2625
lady da smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place .	100.883125
in between teratologies , she was a pretty and shapely woman	6899.7075
but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` people never live forever ' ' .	429.6263
she found this immensely comforting , even though mercer did not make much sense out of it .	255.34459
thus events occurred , and victims changed in appearance , and new ones arrived .	1309.0436
sometimes b ' dikkat took the new ones , resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains , in a ground-truck to be added to other herds .	2229.88
the bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them .	5446.8447
finally , mercer did manage to follow b ' dikkat to the door of the cabin .	723.78064
he had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it .	59.599655
only the memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask b ' dikkat when he , mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it .	595.44946
fighting pleasure itself , he begged b ' dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there .	878.70526
b ' dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway .	38.06683
he spoke through the public address box built into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain , so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend b ' dikkat might be wanting to tell them .	1781.6885
when he said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on shayol	597.329
`` standard years -- eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes .	139.26804
the secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about b ' dikkat .	3759.07
what persuaded the cow-man to remain on shayol ? ?	13.897012
was b ' dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day , surrounded by a family of little cow-people resembling himself ? ?	677.225
mercer , despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of b ' dikkat .	1608.1553
he remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan .	691.8523
the dromozoa kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it .	64.57434
the lady da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her .	269.3888
there were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them , but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less .	816.58307
the years , if they were years , went by .	1659.0621
sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men	167.82062
those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain alvarez .	7375.5635
there was night and day , but no setting of crops , no change of season , no generations of men .	919.6561
time stood still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the lady da took on very remote meaning .	1387.2158
her statement was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe .	154.57338
they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all .	257.43283
there was no dream of escape for these people .	15.401401
though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond b ' dikkat ' s cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh .	962.34436
far long ago , some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter .	40.84113
mercer read it , and so had a few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it .	168.1662
the letter , scraped on stone , had been a message home .	210.00487
they could still read the opening `` once , i was like you , stepping out of my window at the end of day , and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place i lived in .	257.32755
once , like you , i had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands .	199.71706
the front part of my head was called a face , and i could talk with it .	62.358513
now i can only write , and that only when i get out of pain .	117.50041
dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner .	384.64804
he certainly didn ' t want a wife who was fickle as ann .	4613.2524
if he had married her , he ' d have been asking for trouble .	117.263535
sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann , and then could not get back to sleep .	121.585495
his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing .	95.460175
the easiest thing would be to sell out to al budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn ' t allow it .	455.672
the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work .	2421.904
he found that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake .	239.8943
each day he found himself thinking less often of ann	10542.0205
each day the hurt was a little duller , a little less poignant .	357.67877
because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years .	719.4736
the grass in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here .	279.56412
he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows .	966.2749
he had no idea how much time budd would give him .	54.49328
in any case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence .	544.23694
he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with monotonous calm .	1366.378
when , in late afternoon on the last day in june , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle .	404.42053
it could be some kind of trick budd had thought up .	324.17746
no one walked in this country , least of all ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew .	1640.8065
morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled .	395.55582
when they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever .	151.46439
he cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his winchester , and started downstream .	313.77878
his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house .	964.7975
now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet .	432.12488
reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his winchester in his hands .	106.37004
they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty .	263.85178
they were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door .	86.88308
she lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet .	116.750626
the boy came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring .	1093.3427
morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one .	46.399937
he didn ' t think it was possible for this couple to be pretending .	334.27914
he asked , `` could we have a drink ' ' ? ?	17.089813
morgan jerked his head toward the front door .	7.261576
`` in the kitchen ' ' , he said .	5.424052
leaning his winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl .	57.421013
there ' s water in the house ' ' .	4.4524913
she didn ' t move or say anything .	19.57605
her eyes were glazed as if she didn ' t hear or even see him .	102.29985
she had reached a point at which she didn ' t even care how she looked .	183.7142
her face was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry .	636.6525
her blond hair was frowzy , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection .	320.10165
it must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding .	369.3065
he picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house .	277.04852
she was amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn ' t even sure she was conscious .	173.54044
any lingering suspicion that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled .	14075.27
no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him .	87.94547
besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him .	353.03162
he put her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table .	98.95489
they looked a good deal alike , morgan thought .	696.02747
both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features .	174.63194
morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl ' s head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth .	172.59834
she drank greedily , and murmured , `` thank you ' ' , as he lowered her head .	94.12564
he stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition .	379.95416
he had seen a few nester wagons go through the country , the families almost starving to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two .	241.85791
morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove .	360.31946
he brought his winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy .	65.27421
`` who are you and what happened to you ' ' ? ?	7.8085475
`` i ' m billy jones ' ' , the boy answered .	48.03423
we ran out of money and we haven ' t eaten for two days ' ' .	75.66548
`` what are you doing here ' ' ? ?	4.173898
`` are we in wyoming ' ' ? ?	1.1014026
`` about five miles north of the line ' ' .	5.720729
`` we ' ve been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down ' ' .	127.30894
`` you mean you dragged your wife all over hell ' s half-acre looking for work ' ' ? ?	475.95837
`` the town of buckhorn ' s only about six miles from here .	293.4457
why didn ' t you go there ' ' ? ?	2.2193193
`` we didn ' t want town work ' ' , jones said .	19.544626
`` this is a mighty empty country ' ' , morgan said .	33.52334
`` there ' s only one more ranch three miles north of here .	388.24295
you ' d have starved to death if you ' d missed both places ' ' .	152.17854
`` then we ' re lucky we got here .	58.33739
could you give us a job , mr . ' '	15.970745
he was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple .	142.77321
they might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house .	243.30217
the girl ' s thin face haunted him .	2.6936193
it wasn ' t the face of a killer .	645.6363
he wasn ' t so sure about the boy .	122.6514
he hadn ' t shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression .	3501.7842
there was more to this than jones had told him .	53.10151
he ' d be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he couldn ' t send them on , either .	175.99347
`` i could use some help ' ' , morgan said finally , `` but i can ' t afford to pay you anything .	56.555664
i guess you ' d better go on in the morning ' ' .	20.645296
`` we ' ll work for our keep ' ' , the boy said eagerly .	116.07989
`` i ' ve been mucking in a mine in the san juan , but i used to work on a ranch .	194.03929
sharon , she ' s cooked in a restaurant .	253.69005
we ' ll work hard , mr . morgan ' ' .	17.19485
`` i ' ll see ' ' , morgan said .	163.77548
`` right now you need a meal and a bath .	288.08298
your wife ' s in terrible shape ' ' .	1.4647154
morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table .	283.37186
when the meal was ready , he told jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl .	386.42188
he said , `` i ' ve got some supper ready ' ' .	213.50378
she rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair .	175.16904
`` i ' m a mess ' ' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed .	83.97159
how did we get here ' ' ? ?	1.0322806
you fell down in front of the house , and i carried you in .	265.70203
i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep ' ' .	39.62693
she stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said	78.149864
then she murmured `` you ' re very kind , mr . morgan .	85.46487
do you take in all the strays who come by ' ' ? ?	125.34781
`` i don ' t have many strays coming to my front door ' ' , he said .	48.00191
`` think you can walk to the table ' ' ? ?	6.877865
she got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell .	291.08197
he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen .	152.61018
she sat down at the table , shaking her head .	82.84649
`` i ' m sorry , mr . morgan .	192.59253
i ' m usually a very strong woman , but i ' m awfully tired ' ' .	61.918568
`` and hungry ' ' , he said .	10.735524
it ' s not much of a meal , but it ' s what i eat ' ' .	25.050848
`` not much of a meal ' ' ? ?	5.5971565
`` mr . morgan , it ' s the best-looking food i ever saw ' ' .	515.17706
he told himself he had never seen two people eat so much .	341.9206
when they were finally satisfied , jones said , `` i think he ' s going to give us work ' ' .	31.49455
the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself .	1871.3257
when he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn ' t send them on .	38.180664
she said , `` i guess the lord looks out for fools , drunkards , and innocents ' ' .	1388.6605
`` we ' re not drunkards ' ' , she said .	21.132446
`` that ' s all i ' m sure of ' ' .	47.75218
she helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark .	237.87027
he carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall .	124.74622
he said `` you ' ll feel a lot better after you have a bath .	194.60915
your feet are in bad shape , mrs . jones .	72.68072
you ' ll have to go to town to see the doc ' ' .	168.22539
`` no , she ' ll be all right ' ' , jones said quickly .	39.333336
`` i mean , we don ' t have any way to get there and we can ' t expect you to quit work just to take us to town ' ' .	87.87232
`` we ' ll see ' ' , morgan said .	167.3304
`` could you find me a needle and thread ' ' ? ?	41.843994
`` my dress needs some work on it ' ' .	3.9154332
he nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors .	446.29227
he said `` i ' m going to bed ' ' .	19.458145
he nodded at the door in front of him .	70.27657
the bed isn ' t made , but you ' ll find plenty of blankets there ' ' .	110.25212
`` you ' re awfully kind ' ' , the girl said .	62.60249
`` we ' ll pay you back if you ' ll let us .	31.610415
`` it ' s all right ' ' , he said .	7.6230445
jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him .	463.10123
he said `` if it ' s all right with you , mr . morgan , i ' ll sleep out here on the couch .	135.55463
we haven ' t slept together since we started .	276.8246
i just can ' t take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together ' '	259.3857
he stopped , embarrassed , and morgan said , `` i understand that , but i don ' t savvy why you ' d go off and leave your jobs in the first place ' ' .	88.4895
`` we got fired ' ' , jones said .	11.800533
`` we had to do something ' ' .	2.2387378
they were a pair of lost , whipped kids , morgan thought as he went to bed .	898.89996
`` you can ' t stay here with me .	10.532742
it ' s late and you said they ' d be here by dawn ' ' .	149.11827
`` you can ' t make me go ' ' .	3.0215387
gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .	444.7033
he was thinking of rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the splendide .	367.27496
it was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt .	282.1722
beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see .	6516.583
clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .	51.63461
against this bent man in the chair he was powerless .	113.62754
gavin ' s lips moved so that clayton had to stoop to catch the words .	402.97122
`` do you remember big charlie ' ' ? ?	4.1465163
`` he stuck with me all these years .	4.469537
just a half-breed ' pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me .	510.99707
he got into a fight with tom english , your brother ' s son .	38.68061
it was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- big charlie told me so .	1721.7146
they killed big charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago .	1088.9514
i didn ' t understand why , clay .	20.586472
he wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at clayton in a childish kind of wonder .	640.1587
`` do you mean ' ' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you ' re goin ' ' ? ?	228.71092
`` you don ' t hate me any more ' ' ? ?	15.908185
clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` no ' ' .	12.585121
the old man beckoned with one finger and clayton went forward to him .	669.57983
`` all my life ' ' , he said , `` i tried .	37.717216
i saw you driftin away -- but i tried .	1226.6305
and you wanted no part of me when i had so much to give .	72.881584
now there ' s nothin left of me .	2.4920697
laurel is gone , my men are gone , ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me .	90.93676
god in heaven , i can ' t refuse you now .	891.9583
can ' t let you go way from me again ' ' he closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears .	117.10819
`` i ' ll go , clay ' ' .	2.779256
clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .	96.97866
i ' ll saddle the horses and bring them round .	165.77927
he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air .	808.97296
gavin ' s stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words .	3123.4006
when he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .	609.18286
the stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head .	1421.3925
clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .	2340.6812
`` you take it easy , boy ' ' , clayton whispered .	523.6007
`` she doesn ' t want you now .	13.824409
you take it easy , your time will come ' ' .	10.162554
gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure .	434.83658
he had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor .	413.32898
clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .	136.1754
`` clay ' ' , he said , `` where are we goin ' ' ? ?	79.90808
there ' s someone there i have to see .	56.81667
we may take her with us -- to california .	533.38275
i don ' t know yet , it ' s crazy	283.32416
but california is where we ' re goin ' ' .	3.6415765
two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one ' s ever been .	655.94244
start out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened ' ' .	404.6038
`` yes , like a father and son ' ' .	3.2789989
`` i made you what you are ' ' , gavin whispered .	335.18655
`` i made you so you could stand up .	34.609287
`` yes , gavin , you did ' ' .	2.1090844
he approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion ' s quivering neck .	1213.2327
help me up , i feel kind of stiff ' ' .	102.74962
clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child .	163.1779
`` i hate to leave my garden ' ' , gavin said .	73.858086
`` it will grow again -- in california ' ' .	8.431842
`` i loved this valley ' ' , he whispered huskily .	17888.633
`` lived alone here for three years , before any man came .	389.13242
it was nice then , so peaceful and quiet .	66.041435
i don ' t want to leave it ' ' .	4.1279917
clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion ' s rump .	16661.32
the two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness .	164.97775
they rode at a measured pace through the valley .	473.73712
dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .	1221.0789
the moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .	219.97379
it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon ' s wind -- a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men .	824.5361
in that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .	886.44116
he saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying .	809.42096
in vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life .	221.88649
the silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse ' s neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search .	626.2363
they passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .	168.99167
then at last the darkness began to dissolve .	15.802596
a bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky .	148.49153
the wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .	4276.9863
they had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .	682.6627
the two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence .	988.2418
the men in pettigrew ' s were tired from a night ' s drinking , their faces red and baggy .	887.82996
they greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose .	402.34622
lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .	160.00726
he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .	447.00363
that ' s what you wanted , isn ' t it ? ?	8.585416
clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley .	39.83168
`` he ' s not your brother , he ' s gavin ' s son .	136.90028
you see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone ' ' .	238.58205
first he thought of the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley .	822.84564
he remembered gavin ' s smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence .	1751.1609
then he thought of a time when clayton ' s horse had fallen lame in the gap .	340.24603
his wife had said to him `` nellie is in love with clayton roy .	972.1275
he wouldn ' t even dance with her at gavin ' s party .	764.81
and you stand by like a fool and let him do it ' '	52.683548
he remembered clayton ' s mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water .	129.78943
it was the night clayton had tricked them in the poker game .	154.62808
`` you ' re gavin ' s son ' ' , joe purvis had said .	671.9826
`` you brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy .	1965.7452
he meant to help gavin all the time .	45.260868
he made a fool of you , lester ' ' .	3.4286013
he swung round to the other men -- `` we can catch him easy ! !	199.13272
there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place .	158.19809
if we let them go , they won ' t stay away , they ' ll find men to ride with them and they ' ll be back .	67.40011
there ' s only one way they can get out now and that ' s through the gap -- if we ride hard we can take them ' ' .	135.94113
lester ' s hand fluttered to cabot ' s shoulder .	264.84354
`` he killed tom -- do you understand that ' ' ? ?	10.463003
cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night .	356.80423
he fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light .	404.08337
purvis and silas pettigrew were the last to leave .	99.014595
they mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance .	303.9532
in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear .	474.42505
the clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow .	1948.5261
when they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line .	535.47437
the wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind .	6045.177
the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of gavin ' s stallion .	1468.0579
he looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers .	5957.6787
he rode low on the mare ' s neck .	185.51335
ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the gap , no more than a mile away .	202.76216
gavin ' s face was bloodless with excitement .	11.801926
he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north .	1641.755
he knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him .	157.16501
and he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time .	66.7222
the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in his valley .	207.35971
with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again .	281.8262
the gap looming before him -- the place where had confronted jack english on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him .	1034.9158
he was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life .	388.07544
he was , in fact , showing signs of reviving .	1670.126
he was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat .	119.643654
mike stripped these from him and donned them .	18.78346
he and dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose .	574.17786
fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet .	16.652832
julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him .	78.5192
`` i never felt better in my life ' ' , fiske blustered .	12908.472
he turned to susan and kissed her on the cheek .	275.45334
`` thank you , my dear ' ' , he said .	8.747316
first , we ' ve got to get out of here ' ' .	30.818846
`` we ' ll grab horses ' ' , dean said .	171.13614
`` the main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall ' ' .	133.85245
mike debated it , trying to decide whether fiske was strong enough to ride .	3130.5127
but it at least offered him a chance for living .	69.6388
and , for the sake of julia and susan , it had to be tried .	220.56061
light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground .	344.32016
no doubt there would be men guarding the horses .	350.2741
about a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best mike could make out in the moonlight .	832.0946
evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency .	66.20987
`` dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride ' ' , he said .	73.523186
all of you be ready to ride hell for leather ' ' .	65.54015
he added , `` if this doesn ' t work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them ' ' .	211.13033
he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol .	350.15237
she clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes .	708.58575
he was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn ' t meant what he had believed it had .	678.67773
dean turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms .	33.769787
he kissed her also , and with deep tenderness .	429.88983
`` all right ' ' , he said .	8.516384
mike only said , `` later ' ' .	8.266974
`` be careful , mclish ' ' ! !	1.0584345
`` the way you were careful ' ' ? ?	5.703239
`` running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock ' ' ? ?	127.73087
he wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .	243.26353
he might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way julia fortune had taken dean ' s affections from her .	1029.0107
and using him , mike mclish , as a sop to her pride .	1712.67
he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol .	364.67844
`` stay well back of me ' ' , he said .	7.2251534
`` i ' m going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending i ' m one of the guerrillas .	359.065
there ' s bound to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close ' ' .	234.4725
holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade .	168.61626
it was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings .	257.36203
mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses .	209.42557
they were tethered , army style , on stable lines .	1790.079
`` is that you , bill ' ' ? ?	7.955046
the guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight .	2247.954
mike kept walking and got within arm ' s reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch .	3139.6167
mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .	6.707224
but the luck that had been running their way left him .	418.30768
the guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle .	1286.1077
he tried to veer the rifle around to fire into mike ' s body .	217.36603
mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded .	424.55887
mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash .	5.288131
this time it connected solidly on the man ' s temple , felling him .	348.549
the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills .	314.2124
the startled horses began rearing on their tethers .	4.3102727
`` no , but the fat ' s in the fire ' ' ! !	46.24296
`` there ' s no chance now of all of us getting away .	143.23172
you ' ll have to try it alone ' ' .	5.265967
the sentry ' s saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need .	1300.5824
mike took the bayonet from dean ' s hand and slashed the picket line .	356.77597
dean resisted mike ' s attempt to push him toward the horse .	167.04652
the rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back .	144.63055
you ' re the one that ' s taking the big chance ' ' .	94.20881
dean still hesitated , but mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand .	1261.0559
`` no telling how good this horse is ' ' , mike panted .	1391.8917
`` favor him and save something in case you hit trouble .	3468.4712
watch out for apaches when it comes daylight .	31.05859
we ' ll still have the rifle , and i might be able to round up some more .	99.02734
i ' ll stampede the rest of these horses so they can ' t chase you ' ' .	133.75127
dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back .	547.98956
`` mclish ' ' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` i ' d be a mighty sad man if we never met again ' ' .	144.04176
then he was on his way at a gallop .	734.9203
mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet .	4110.8354
he darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there .	1092.8042
these poured through the gate and joined the flight .	2377.0928
the animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges .	1636.6525
the guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure .	63.230072
`` they ' re stealin ' the stock ' ' ! !	9.175142
he scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings .	123.87352
his shout had been taken up and repeated .	29.609072
the guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses .	294.41574
all were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all .	523.8327
durkin and calhoun came running from the post .	60.295414
they bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .	6775.5537
they followed the others toward the east gate .	10.116121
beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were apaches .	1690.4656
mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings .	78.1278
he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .	391.48413
a man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to mike ' s left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade .	284.68286
mike crawled to the door and peered in .	4920.0586
a lantern hung from a peg , giving light .	1364.3624
ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner .	139.93617
a brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches .	2000.8958
an ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges .	2822.928
mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty .	281.34418
shouldering the load he peered from the door .	7.862999
his looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas .	404.79712
he looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration .	867.31915
snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post .	1228.172
he picked up the powder canister and ran out .	15.104633
bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it .	1885.7922
he shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon .	1397.033
he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .	112.568855
the stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him .	448.8715
one struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack .	1452.6221
its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again .	1711.4928
a bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety .	489.31573
another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .	112.76704
susan and julia came from the door and dragged him with them .	490.3612
the three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap .	178.33763
susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .	23.677906
she crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks .	1874.4183
some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak .	12.691763
the iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars .	306.91083
mike rolled to susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet .	221.657
he hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls .	3133.5266
guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house .	498.40686
mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired .	17302.775
he dropped a man with the first bullet .	18.466917
at the same moment wheeler fiske fired the rifle mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit .	1792.2843
the blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .	9.088287
the guerrillas realized they faced a new problem .	12.446507
`` there goes our grub an ' ammunition ' ' ! !	12.735945
`` get a bucket line going ' ' ! !	14.264412
the guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring .	95.17592
but what few containers they found were inadequate .	7.422753
many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort .	621.1203
`` drag the wagons to the spring ' ' ! !	12.415325
`` run ' em right into the spring ! !	150.1256
one of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame .	201.94759
a sizable supply of powder had been touched off .	26.805141
the wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings .	192.63387
the glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine mike ' s wound .	371.138
the bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor .	1090.8842
but it had missed the bone and had passed on through .	665.3389
susan and julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury .	787.6344
mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it .	594.0876
`` so it wasn ' t the earthquake that made him return to his village ' ' ! !	163.86563
now dammit , i don ' t want to go into any more explanations .	97.70195
reverend jason , looking worried , hurried toward us .	100.03262
`` anything wrong , cap ' n ? ?	1.074452
the men seem to think so ' ' .	2.1499417
`` dirion found a large war party south of us .	227.96999
they ' ll probably attack at dawn ' ' , montero said .	522.7166
he brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp .	22.14058
using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , `` fort up ! !	228.42918
there ' s a large war party on their way ' ' ! !	45.788364
for a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb .	30172.2
then little billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal .	643.09955
`` that was a terrible thing to do ' ' , i said to oso .	223.81078
and here all the time you knew the sioux would be using our rifles on them ! !	987.3262
god , what a world you people live in ' ' .	9.957447
`` old knife ' s got the largest war party ever seen on the river ' ' , he said calmly .	182.02916
`` what would you have done in montero ' s moccasins ? ?	489.86105
let old knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else ' ' ? ?	70.16254
`` mr . manuel did that in the war .	216.87726
that ' s why the british never got the tribes to fight for the king .	187.94481
mr . manuel whispered in the ears of the sioux that the cheyennes were comin ' to raid ' em for their horses .	1121.5117
then he went on to the cheyennes and told them that the sioux was goin ' to move up .	562.07965
hell , they were fightin ' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else .	153.93605
the war department wrote mr . manuel a letter and said he was a hero .	89.78868
he carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin ' ' .	250.78862
`` but that was war ' ' , i said .	46.20257
`` there ' s no war on now ' ' .	3.4415715
in this country there ' s a war on every time the grass turns green .	471.97864
first it was the nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites .	165.78543
and it ' s goin ' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land ' ' .	169.69975
i remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight .	521.8601
`` that ' s why this company ' s important .	59.57113
once we get over the mountains others will come along .	261.49628
that ' s why the trust don ' t want us to make it .	27.049446
-- old knife ' s not the only chief he ' ll get to do his dirty work ! !	203.38945
before we get through he ' ll have the blackfeet hankerin ' for our hair and our goods .	10611.518
well , talkin ' ain ' t goin ' to help -- let ' s fort up ' ' ! !	151.49428
as i dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , i grudgingly found myself agreeing with oso ' s logic , especially when i imagined what would have happened to missy if old knife ' s large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company .	2888.7434
for , unlike the sioux and the crows , the aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet .	2761.7012
more of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains .	619.5853
still , i was disgusted with myself for agreeing with montero ' s methods .	4252.1367
surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done .	28.475555
in the brief moment i had to talk to them before i took my post on the ring of defenses , i indicated i was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river .	706.63885
`` i think montero did right ' ' , amy said firmly .	569.6245
`` it was a terrible thing to do .	26.266792
but oso replied calmly , `` trouble ain ' t easy to dodge out in this country , rev ' rend ' ' .	372.0362
gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky .	3783.4546
our camp was in the center of a wide valley .	1636.555
montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush .	1696.4323
he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire .	734.8134
the pony herd was the one flaw in our defense	2544.4968
the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .	81.90137
wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors .	3529.4946
the cooks had prepared one of the best meals we ' d had in a long time , and on montero ' s orders had baked enough bread to last the day .	487.3139
buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered .	3993.8958
although we didn ' t expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless .	1278.4495
coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one ' s skin crawl .	4254.023
oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms	161.84845
every time i closed my eyes , i saw gray eyes rushing at me with a knife .	2665.0513
it was a relief when they finally came .	208.22618
they poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry .	1414.6362
`` oso ' ' , montero called `` i ' ll get gray eyes ' ' .	53.63703
`` that ' ll be a pleasure to see ' ' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle .	418.0702
`` hold your fire ' ' , montero was shouting .	342.7201
i ' ll shoot the first man who doesn ' t ' ' .	11.948261
at first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses ' heads .	5790.676
his face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white	363.67072
jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest .	76.93334
next to him was a young boy i was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions .	452.0977
his mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams .	552.5328
my god , how long is he going to wait , i thought .	66.28401
the feathered lance was still above his head .	9.768546
as he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse .	3453.1733
at the last second i dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony .	366.6746
i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball .	769.0169
he started to run but oso ' s shot caught him on the wing .	449.3229
he jerked once in the grass and lay still .	291.84833
`` if you ' re goin ' to kill ' em -- ! !	114.07542
what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides .	560.67566
the aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated .	1581.6333
out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses .	2245.1123
the morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder .	4448.7363
a horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy .	84.83423
one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek .	307.767
his legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him .	2731.826
he was dead before he hit the ground .	9.340726
`` for christ ' s sake , don ' t waste your powder on one of ' em ' ' ! !	100.847725
the charge , i tell you ' ' ! !	6.73608
the sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint .	1630.9404
they grew louder as the indians charged again .	12.208067
i could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their spine-chilling cries .	2500.1602
`` gray eyes is back , , montero said .	26.027292
the war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat .	101.167435
i could see the blood running down his chest .	31.351242
he was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump .	984.8398
in my sights i watched him looming bigger and bigger .	353.43805
montero ' s shot had caught him high in the chest	141.39342
this time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire .	1276.2653
the horses were only several lengths away when he fired .	464.3576
the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse .	14.307826
our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts .	2817.3743
i heard the whir of an ax and a canadian ' s face burst apart in a bloody spray .	894.19446
i saw little billy rise and fire almost point blank and an indian ' s face became shattered flesh and bone .	1437.3843
a second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn ' t seem possible they were in flight .	481.0834
oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck .	1309.4269
other indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets .	35402.367
reverend jason got one , the canadians the others .	502.93063
i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position .	256.50232
the pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again .	954.3687
this time more of them hurdled the barrier .	10.222178
a small indian dived at montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt .	1866.7518
it sounded like a man kicking a melon .	13.186079
above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales .	3405.5786
although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me .	505.27914
i could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil .	1030.474
his eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in .	311.09875
coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil .	675.09863
now under me i could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint .	397.5879
it was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient hawkinses .	14167.384
others , badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs .	2527.7476
some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts .	3248.721
in the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .	1059.9517
she was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist .	912.2492
`` i saw your fire ' ' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .	294.43173
`` you could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size .	469.86002
it wouldn ' t matter to a fool like you .	103.81694
`` all right ' ' , wilson said quickly .	558.61847
an hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company .	486.68414
`` i ' m not advising you ' ' , she said .	10.427563
and make sure it ' s out when you leave in the morning ' ' .	17.202793
it took him a long time to compose himself .	82.128975
`` there ' s some mistake ' ' , he said finally .	51.317837
`` you ' re right about the fire .	4.944588
it ' s bigger than it has to be , though i don ' t see where it ' s doing any harm .	48.71551
but you ' re wrong about the rest of it .	19.788755
i ' m not leaving in the morning .	24.954624
she showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face .	174.48254
it didn ' t seem to tell her anything .	148.46695
she glanced around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground , the two kids , the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight .	1340.8582
then she turned back to wilson and smiled , and he wasn ' t quite sure what she meant by it .	93.71493
`` you own this place ' ' ? ?	1.0612028
she said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly .	204.32281
`` from a man in st . louis ' ' , wilson said .	46.28332
my father ran him off here six years ago ' ' .	9.797976
he stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .	116.98367
she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .	2649.6975
`` carwood didn ' t tell you that ' ' , she said .	9.333222
it ' s not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of .	125.45023
and it doesn ' t make any difference .	4.6218257
i have it with me , right here .	10.793372
`` never mind ' ' , she said sternly .	8499.939
`` it wouldn ' t matter to my father , and not to me .	38.68681
i meant what i said about that fire .	25.178555
be sure it ' s out when you leave .	20.014254
i ' ll let you go back to doing the dishes now ' ' .	133.45648
it was meant to insult him , and didn ' t quite succeed .	387.7146
he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now .	319.98428
`` i don ' t mind washing dishes now and then ' ' , he said pleasantly .	117.05806
somebody might mistake you for a woman ' ' .	2.0659373
he meant to say more , but he never got the chance .	100.76687
she brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back .	232.53369
she swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle .	484.9659
she came down against him , and he tried to break her fall .	145.81601
he grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him .	256.5422
it made him a little sick , and he let go of her .	113.92859
he got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her .	100.62072
`` i ought to ' ' -- he said .	10.30218
he was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps .	1197.6118
`` that quirt -- i ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good .	97.79443
`` she isn ' t , mister ' ' .	3.2495613
the voice came from behind him , and wilson turned .	2228.054
the fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees .	135.91507
but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and wilson had a good look at him .	146.24864
he was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , wilson thought .	782.9873
and he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek .	3312.5847
`` she ' s not a man , mister ' ' , he said .	87.82021
if you ' ve got any ideas ' ' .	1.6273853
he raised the winchester and pointed it at wilson ' s chest .	117.762184
`` put the rifle down , joseph ' ' , the girl said .	38.922756
`` i thought i told you to stay home ' ' .	12.638238
the half-breed eased the winchester down and rested it across his lap .	288.66656
`` you shouldn ' t be riding up here after dark , judith ' ' , he said quietly .	603.0349
it ' s no job for you ' ' .	1.9730699
the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him .	1115.6924
you ' ve got no business up here ' ' .	2.337771
the half-breed didn ' t answer this time .	17.970888
but the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry .	93.736595
he watched the half-breed as he turned silently .	26.060717
they could hear the pony ' s feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out .	278.17188
you ' re pretty hard on him ' ' .	1.4401082
`` he works for my father ' ' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind .	48.7619
is there anything else you want to know ' ' ? ?	3.7484033
`` not now ' ' , wilson said .	8.866493
`` i guess i ' ll find out soon enough .	1150.7028
you ' ve got blood on your cheek .	3.64605
it must have got there when you fell against me ' ' .	15.30841
she wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat .	188.90186
`` i ' ll bet that ' s as close as you ' ve been to a man since you were a baby ' ' , wilson said .	109.45038
he saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist .	2784.3423
`` oh , no ' ' , he said , and he was without humor now .	138.07004
`` i ' ve had enough of that .	124.482635
i don ' t know what goes on around here , and i don ' t care .	39.519672
i don ' t know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and i don ' t care about that , either .	81.50733
but i ' ll know how to handle you next time ' ' .	84.18348
she brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker .	172.70964
he side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding .	758.0987
she finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .	135.74861
her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before .	116.959305
he had forgotten that she was so pretty .	37.510742
but her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward cruelty , meanness , self-will .	1112.7316
he had known women like that , one woman in particular .	555.34344
he watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn ' t hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .	114.429375
they weren ' t sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending .	173.6762
he hadn ' t shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman .	1073.04
they expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed .	185.55856
they lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed .	2229.143
`` go to sleep ' ' , he said .	6.1084795
there ' s better things to do than listen to something like that .	156.69075
i ' ll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me ' ' .	177.52821
he found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream .	180.90746
the coyote was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it .	254.28192
he had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .	1083.6327
if she did , he could stand it better in the light .	92.99379
he scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out .	174.53995
that afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high .	338.20987
already some of the pain had gone from amelia ' s death .	823.4127
there would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief .	4981.9824
and they had almost everything they needed land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses .	1697.7028
the land wasn ' t all wilson had expected of it .	124.94763
six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in st . louis had said	74.44961
well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it .	135.69865
the water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard .	1190.3125
livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs .	345.306
in the last analysis , though , wilson had little cause to complain .	505.02982
the place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after amelia ' s burial -- and it would serve its purpose .	587.82794
there was only one place where jake carwood ' s description had gone badly awry the peace and quiet .	1343.4385
it hadn ' t started out that way .	23.664797
and he had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better .	272.717
they had the house cleaned up by noon , and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses .	222.7356
he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him .	526.1656
they were going to town , and they were both excited .	390.16006
wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they weren ' t going to town at all .	233.1637
that girl last night , what was her name ? ?	62.03471
it was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember .	422.13403
he finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him .	559.1869
he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than judith pierce had made it seem .	2029.9462
there was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle wouldn ' t stop to graze .	1062.2919
there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard .	594.4841
yes , there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble .	86.80469
there were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres .	476.02646
the first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley .	395.7767
it was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better .	249.69682
a warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves .	423.72238
a red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road .	356.83264
it took them an hour before they came to the first houses of kelseyville .	250.49725
the town was about what wilson expected one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings , a water tower , a few warehouses , a single hotel	1349.4512
such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility of this	116.321465
under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all .	94.72524
i went to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters .	1036.9346
it was dark and , i sensed , very large	463.6589
only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it .	2048.1318
sometimes i was aware of people moving about in the darkness .	225.82411
i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded .	263.67456
a glimpse of three of four vague figures , at the most .	71.14415
since they could see me but i not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me .	327.52692
this impressed me , until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence .	1737.394
his job simply consisted in registering new men .	9.546834
his authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further .	316.1932
none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him .	206.36807
he spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality .	4440.903
he wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath .	7811.1636
it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was .	226.18684
but it was not easy for him and he often slipped .	1223.1389
when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle i noticed how the clerk winced .	7996.4766
i felt certain he was really a spineless little man .	113.90616
his hat ( the cause of his baldness ? ?	9.515716
) hung on a hook on the wall , and underneath it i could see his tie , knotted , ready to be slipped over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck .	891.19086
the morning ' s tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men ' s magazines .	780.97375
on a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music .	3865.6821
once , pressing him , i learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall .	219.74211
noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person .	2535.0432
with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air .	343.77856
when he saw me coming he turned his radio off .	4440.5513
he made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf .	127.93081
he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance .	16422.828
what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me .	18.98015
in the mornings , i was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall .	1835.8058
they , and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office .	1150.3407
he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words .	1899.3958
i was shown , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning .	118.65525
now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when i reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand .	228.61934
he couldn ' t afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said .	159.35745
each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient .	692.59796
later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket .	150.01096
having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , i gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself .	1156.9005
when suitably lighted , what would it look like ? ?	23.523777
the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air .	402.3639
one afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , i had visited the toilet adjoining the hall .	984.91583
by counting the number of stalls and urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time .	305.67612
for although i had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended .	543.7607
i could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as i had no measure of comparison .	160.52937
i had for some time been hoping , in vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself .	571.5151
i knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , i could not tell .	119.06729
it was , i felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light .	391.74725
this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below .	598.3692
also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder .	2613.1558
no sooner would i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention .	326.8518
and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently .	707.73785
it sprang from a type of mentality i ' d encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here .	260.065
i decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed .	467.4499
i felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when i did not go to look at it from a distance .	113.75792
i lived in a state of suspense because of it .	69.15324
i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to .	241.51726
i had signed it off on the forms .	52.465233
my future lay solely with the hall , yet what did i know about the hall at this point ? ?	194.64981
although i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning .	292.17667
i wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to be wearing .	618.62054
i was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall .	203.18755
though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me .	488.7887
the river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it .	724.272
sometimes i noticed the tops of ships ' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs .	25769.162
the sounds issuing from beyond -- winches whirring , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me .	2354.9958
the hall , on the other hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons .	7608.572
it resembled nothing i ' d ever seen before .	196.04219
its front was windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked out upon the street .	572.3199
i kept circling the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall .	71.037125
but it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it .	941.841
for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen ' s lunch counters , yet never did i cease to feel myself a stranger there .	3072.9714
i returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk .	1309.4987
as i had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application .	270.4149
at last , when i put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual .	234.21034
when i asked him what , if anything , i could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall .	117.569405
i could consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o ' clock .	185.01396
the clerk impressed this upon me that i should not arrive in the hall before ten o ' clock .	101.963
when i went for my interview with the director i saw why .	1103.7552
although it was dark as usual i could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people .	217.01991
the big fans were going , drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling .	7442.0576
i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs .	2928.9128
the staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men .	990.1554
no one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office i noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open .	157.10582
past it i could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor .	67.58361
i was at once disappointed , although just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained .	129.68216
he was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height	2729.1438
he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar .	5182.592
they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment .	42318.875
but he came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application .	577.4873
i had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times .	335.91986
as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall .	759.3501
he spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance .	40.95324
begging my pardon , he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall .	543.63983
he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there	157.3113
indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them .	477.91077
was i sure , he asked , that i knew what i was applying for ? ?	300.60458
what sort of men i would come into contact with , at the hall ? ?	151.12422
i felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place .	589.723
though i doubted that he would understand me , i told the director my motives for applying .	712.7365
i had always , i said , hankered after working hard with my hands .	406.7112
this desire , i went on , growing voluble as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing .	914.8603
to this effect i had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence .	1135.6633
the flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head .	58.636936
before they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the guard ' s own gun against the uncovered head , hard .	664.0049
the man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor .	58.377457
barton said harshly , `` why did you do that ' ' ? ?	14.216766
`` what did you want me to do , kiss him ? ?	612.5836
he dumped me in solitary twice ' ' .	1.9474778
barton caught the lighter man ' s shoulder and swung him around .	268.8488
`` let ' s get one thing straight , you and me .	66.94499
the only reason we brought you was to get miller out .	669.88293
if you ever try anything without my orders i ' ll kill you ' ' .	26.761713
it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him , the thin-lipped smile held insolence , but he had no time to waste now .	1409.3542
they filed out through the guard-room door , into the paved square .	745.6675
there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate , but they were in other cell blocks .	1276.1599
they moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall .	177.08621
they reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above , and powers slipped through the door .	264.75452
they looked up in surprise as powers came in .	197.0494
`` what are you doing out of the block ' ' ? ?	31.509474
`` it ' s curtiss ' ' , he said , naming the man rankin had hit .	1030.6775
`` i ' ve got to have help ' ' .	4.670871
the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet .	18.224424
`` what ' s wrong with him ' ' ? ?	3.9225192
`` he ' s having some kind of a fit ' ' .	45.43734
as he passed through it barton shoved his gun against the man ' s side .	53.177086
`` one sound and you ' re dead ' ' .	4.6395297
the man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell .	8921.582
deliberately , with none of rankin ' s viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard ' s head .	647.75543
they slid through the wicket in the big gate , ghosted across the dark ground .	1388.1362
barton was relieved to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts .	2748.0723
he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the escape party they would be short .	929.69934
they walked the horses , heading along the river , barton and emmett foster in the lead , seven men riding quietly through the night .	999.34656
the only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts .	1957.149
in a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees .	221.07654
he had been one of the original night riders , one who had escaped the trial .	373.1861
it was to him that barton had sent carl dill on dill ' s release from the prison .	1341.4438
clyde miller was crying softly to himself , shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt .	13196.7295
kid boyd was unusually silent , rankin watchful , a few paces apart .	677.5793
barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers .	451.37543
`` i won ' t even try to thank you ' ' .	26.828798
he said in a studied voice , `` i didn ' t do it for you .	27.074558
you ' re the only man the night riders will follow .	1271.5824
we ' ve been starving and i don ' t like to starve ' ' .	124.43481
barton turned away , his eyes falling upon rankin beside his horse .	3557.4653
`` meaning you want me to ride out ' ' ? ?	5.5854754
`` you aren ' t one of us .	7.305546
there ' s nothing for you here ' ' .	1.8054657
`` i got no place to go ' ' .	1.6740469
he did not trust rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct .	684.4891
but ten years in prison had taught him realities .	9602.628
they were in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money .	731.68304
it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them night riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure .	1128.4209
but if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the killers on the other side .	288.3782
`` your choice ' ' , he said briefly , and turned to kid boyd .	814.7209
`` bury those uniforms so they won ' t be found ' ' .	12.6582365
then barton touched carl dill ' s arm and moved off , up the river bank .	231.18896
he wanted a careful , uninterrupted report from dill on the conditions in the valley .	861.5415
they squatted on their heels in the deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket , passing it over silently .	1937.0751
he too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco .	1305.5502
mitchell barton drew in the fragrance deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled .	3507.3088
through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly .	646.129
for his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell .	534.46826
carl dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man .	2093.8176
he had been the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate ' s money .	262.3527
the one thing they had in common was their hatred .	807.3814
it had drawn them together , and since his release from prison dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night ' s escape .	3029.4812
he said now , `` i ' ve got the perfect headquarters set up .	758.8278
twenty years before a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky hills south of grass valley .	3391.8972
they had spent a million dollars , carving in a road , putting up buildings , drilling their haulage tunnel .	2192.64
then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned .	236.34225
`` the road ' s washed badly ' ' , said dill , `` but there ' s a trail you can get over with a horse .	166.77264
a company of cavalry couldn ' t come in there if two men were guarding that trail ' ' .	341.30048
`` how do the valley people feel ' ' ? ?	3.5208914
but kruger ' s men keep them off balance , and they don ' t trust me .	51.87128
when they learn you ' re in the hills though , they ' ll rally , don ' t worry about that ' ' .	152.84935
barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind .	578.2459
dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension .	1516.4187
`` he ' s in morgan ' s ferry ' ' .	17.26678
`` what ' s he doing there ' ' ? ?	4.329303
`` your sister-in-law has the faro bank in cap ayres ' saloon ' ' .	10086.701
after another long pause he asked , `` how many people know who they are ' ' ? ?	44.840103
he ' s quite a rat , you know .	40.74835
he sold out to kruger ' s men .	6.594269
he ' s informed them of everything you ' ve ever written him .	128.78653
let ' s go get the boy ' ' .	1.908211
i almost didn ' t tell you ' ' .	1.8080692
`` if you hadn ' t i ' d have killed you ' ' .	53.75226
`` but you can ' t ride into the ferry .	174.62254
that ' s what they ' ll expect you to do .	82.50072
they ' ll be there waiting for you .	60.68761
i understand how you feel about the child .	12.083226
barton ' s voice was rougher than dill had ever heard it .	115.779335
my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away .	971.1226
`` i can ' t leave him there .	6.678122
donald kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and i wouldn ' t entrust a snake to his tender care .	548.70654
i ' ve got to get the boy .	12.268561
barton ' s men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult .	747.6581
it was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state .	481.45932
it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame .	14598.576
it reached the mines at north san juan and bloomfield .	6089.3657
it brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences .	1552.5817
for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg , and mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence .	2588.7615
the office was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove .	1500.6606
the building was dwarfed by the scene outside .	111.45619
there a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside .	3627.4883
the gravel was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth .	5038.0894
it was partially cemented by ages and pressure , yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire hoses , and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices .	1167.9746
a million dollars ' of gold a month .	13.381256
a million tons of rock and soil and brush .	140.43745
their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles .	744.17847
hague , like all who worked near the pits , was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums .	10964.695
he was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air .	32309.012
fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt .	6.419884
ten years older than mitch barton , he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation .	2010.1068
he was proud of his accomplishments , proud of his job , proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted him .	994.2394
he lived and breathed for the mining company .	6.261291
no man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life .	720.09143
there came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke in the entrance from the outer room .	2850.8848
the man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose .	1444.4482
the eyes always held hague , eyes of a dead man , lidless as a lizard ' s , with the fixed intensity of a cobra .	883.08374
even hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was kodyke .	5402.1694
he knew nothing about the man ' s history .	76.9598
kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from kruger .	2951.3528
kodyke was to head the dread company police .	5.0720162
he supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to san francisco .	386.4921
he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype .	484.38907
we want him back there or we want him dead ' ' .	29.42581
kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully .	1217.6803
you know how the ranchers in the valley are .	404.0516
ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches .	17967.553
it cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them .	1552.6675
we don ' t want barton ' s night riders loose again ' ' .	927.25104
the gunman nodded , slipping the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing .	407.7837
normally hague wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew kodyke was aware of all he said .	957.7103
if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it .	94.38038
after they had finished eating , melissa took sprite the kitten under her arm -- `` so that auntie grace can teach it about the whistle ' ' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother .	1050.5608
she had offered to walk , but pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` auntie ' ' .	316.60205
when they reached their neighbor ' s house , pamela said a few polite words to grace and kissed melissa lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompted by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again .	1117.4457
then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her ostensible destination .	500.7996
as she drove , she thought about her plan .	773.7198
so simple , in fact , that it might even work -- although pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance .	993.8502
that mistake , she thought , had cost her dearly these past few days , and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her .	541.1293
she must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest .	13236.976
when the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver house , pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped .	1710.8237
all of her movements were careful and methodical , partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime .	724.5082
she locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house .	87.59952
here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom .	174.8024
on her bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving -- an object which , pamela believed now , had been the property of her great-grandfather , major hiram munroe culver .	10144.893
he had belonged to this land and , perhaps , had desecrated it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him .	358.87314
if she , pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation .	888.85333
she would return this symbol to the mountain , as one pours seed back into the soil every spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice .	4617.4077
slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house .	361.27448
there was only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that unnamed , unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom .	22789.25
atonement , if atonement were possible , could only be made at that sacred , sacrificial basin .	1075.4445
it was there that she would have to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness .	25127.752
perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream .	21.831524
but she was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken .	158.56854
facing the forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool .	380.37927
she remembered little of her previous journey there with grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it .	261.1698
the forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand .	1733.3733
the ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle .	408.80508
birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time .	1795.647
it was not , thought pamela , such an evil place after all .	365.67078
no wonder melissa responded so completely to its beckoning .	29561.06
perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed .	1597.1089
was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this ? ?	526.4361
pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along .	382.7602
the slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear .	789.2713
she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .	2961.078
having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them .	1140.8816
a few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous	1283.2207
today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable .	1399.556
she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail	549.9741
she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal .	1234.754
if , as she walked , her steps fumbled from time to time , she chose to ignore that omen .	3262.7146
if the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim , she tried not to heed .	593.4905
she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest .	155.41074
it did not care what sort of person prowled its woods , plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes .	13306.018
unconcerned , indifferent , unmotivated , the forest was simply there -- fighting man ' s depredations with more abundant growth and man ' s follies with its own musical evening laughter .	1050.3184
red man or white man , pacifist or killer , the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence	2633.1484
knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man .	932.76685
in her grim pursuit of tranquillity , pamela focused her thoughts on her husband .	1057.5703
if , when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand .	146.0882
how could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent ? ?	525.644
indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined , ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor .	3421.6572
his bright , daylight mind would whistle away such images	14276.308
they would not dare to face his scoffing .	4.264841
his presence would have interfered with her duty .	7.1511273
the mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles .	586.76746
the trees huddled more closely together , their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun .	932.0172
bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass , pamela could no longer be positive of her direction .	807.1066
she was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles .	460.49777
the forest had become an alien world where she strove , alone , unprotected , unguided , to deal with whatever hindrances were offered .	3903.2305
it was a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , eclipsing the sun and human time .	2756.6162
at one and the same time , she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry .	1032.7201
silence came into the forest -- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees .	2111.844
silence walked at pamela ' s side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear .	1608.0786
silence stood in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , blocking her retreat .	200.04779
she stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth .	8572.907
in spite of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , bruising her arm on a naked stone .	2063.7725
for a moment , she could not catch her breath and then , her breath returning in short , frightened spasms , she lifted herself to her feet laboriously .	1875.611
she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes .	450.8527
her arm bled slightly , and the offended skin cried out in pain .	3486.3994
she seemed to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees .	1353.6744
she stood quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her .	185.15465
the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped , virtually shutting out the sun completely .	4369.819
the earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun ' s rays .	444.83734
she had the feeling that , under the mouldering leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain .	874.9457
not a breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove , catching pamela in a leering embrace .	2913.0945
there was a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified , never actually perceived .	1359.5273
where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene ? ?	342.0065
she already knew this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive .	552.9141
it enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles .	483.6118
it crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body , seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin .	4555.699
it crawled across her breasts , suffocating the life in her nipples .	4316.6274
it circled her thighs , exploring with its icy tentacles .	22391.775
it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus , and its particles , spreading , creeping , crawling , joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached	6290.1333
clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws .	593.7044
she had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , depriving her of reason and sight .	1454.9298
but she did not know which way to go .	36.506283
the shadows of the trees engulfed her , foreclosing every possible exit from the grove .	31856.16
she had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles .	14278.677
she could not scream , for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth , who would hear , who would listen ? ?	1330.8809
she had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place .	612.62427
she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back .	2554.9585
her own body protested , aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed , where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed .	20427.139
tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her .	48.553627
miraculously , she found exactly the right statement .	7.7079926
she began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him .	203.22087
i ' m well aware that you ' ve got a pedigree as long as my leg , and that i don ' t amount to anything .	103.583694
`` but it don ' t matter a-tall ' ' , lord supplied fondly .	1171.3824
`` to me you ' ll always be the girl o ' my dreams , an ' the sweetest flower that grows ' ' .	1615.473
beaming idiotically , he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her .	964.1757
i ' ve got something to say to you , and by god you ' re going to listen .	50.590424
you ' re going to listen ' ' ! !	25.038164
he said he wanted very much to listen .	8.56657
he knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as pleasin ' to the ear , and he didn ' t want to miss a word of it .	204.0681
so would she mind speaking a little louder ? ?	19.671577
`` i think you stink , tom lord ! !	13.132658
i think you ' re mean and hateful and stupid , and -- louder ' ' ? ?	314.6967
so i can hear you while i ' m checkin ' the car .	809.3951
looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble ' ' .	70.35406
he waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly .	1763.494
wasn ' t you goin ' to say somethin ' ' ' ? ?	277.1598
then , helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` maybe you could write it down for me , huh ? ?	304.96695
print it in real big letters , an ' i can cipher it out later ' ' .	1290.043
`` aah , go on ' ' , she said .	22.494076
`` just go the hell on ' ' .	2.8828883
he grinned , nodded , and walked around to the front of the car .	38.480873
lips pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side .	23558.877
then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock absorber , and spring .	5207.204
he went prone on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination .	534.83136
after a time , he straightened again , brushing the red permian dust from his hands , slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five-dollar shirt .	6710.412
he wore no gun -- a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country .	164.11484
never , he ' d once told joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun .	339.25876
and he really feels that way , she thought .	241.81085
that ' s really all he ' s got , all he is .	167.62021
just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package .	30755.941
if i could make myself feel the same way	4.7826543
against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis .	510.3535
here in the god-forsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , tom lord looked almost insignificant , almost contemptible .	3602.085
he was handsome , with his coal-black hair and eyes , his fine-chiseled features .	2394.616
but she ' d known plenty of handsomer guys , and , conceding his good looks , what was there left ? ?	455.8365
he could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong .	490.87262
and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance .	528.4373
just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on everyone .	2176.602
but , by gosh , i want him and i ' m going to have him ! !	48.95756
he caught her eye , came back around the car with the boot-wearer	599.86414
why did these yokels still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years ? ?	481.33423
he slid in at her side , tucked a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffered one to her .	1271.9723
`` oh , cut it out , tom ' ' ! !	15.747148
`` can ' t you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute ' ' ? ?	783.54865
`` this ain ' t your brand , maybe ' ' , lord suggested .	497.12253
`` or maybe you just don ' t feel like a cigar ' ' ? ?	59.801006
`` i feel like getting back to town , that ' s what i feel like ! !	63.515694
now , are you going to take me or am i supposed to walk ' ' ? ?	70.28442
`` might get there faster walkin ' ' ' , lord drawled , `` seein ' as how i got a busted front spring .	7572.038
on the other hand , howsomever , maybe you wouldn ' t either .	92.48034
i figger it ' s probl ' y a sixty-five-mile walk , and i c ' n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours ' ' .	1066.0464
there ' s nothing out here but rattlesnakes ' ' .	5.977987
`` now , ain ' t it the truth ' ' ? ?	36.76687
`` not a danged thing but rattlesnakes , so i reckon i ' ll get the boss rattler to help me ' ' .	404.43405
she saw it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat -- a test well in unexplored country .	887.281
and even with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there	126.25546
sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town .	79.27996
a wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency .	309.84113
he had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others .	463.4907
`` well , let ' s get going ' ' , she said impatiently .	270.52026
`` i ' ' -- she broke off , frowning .	14061.155
`` what did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? ?	7292.5703
getting the boss rattlesnake to help you ' ' ? ?	2.2224164
`` why , i meant what i said ' ' , lord declared .	129.15933
`` what else would i mean , anyways ' ' ? ?	2.7632763
then , with a shrug of pretended indifference , she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up .	446.7134
in his mood , it was the best way to handle him	59.40434
that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever .	25.952267
otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum -- teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of tom lord vs . joyce lakewood .	5410.496
the car lurched along at a snail ' s crawl , the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself .	7364.2056
lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel .	1098.9972
he seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned .	417.12076
along with this self-satisfaction , however , joyce sensed a growing tension .	818.39923
it poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated .	716.5812
joyce had seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion .	587.4825
that was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of big sands with aaron mcbride , field boss for the highlands oil & gas company .	3721.5664
tom had been laying for aaron mcbride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line .	103.0676
mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .	184.87163
he had a legitimate reason for wearing it .	20.070694
it was payday for highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields .	130.71304
moreover , as long as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff ' s office had made no previous issue of it .	172.2622
`` so what ' s this all about ' ' ? ?	10.096236
i ' m not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit ' ' .	106.07809
by failing to do as he was told instantly -- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car -- he had played into lord ' s hands .	341.9705
the trouble was that he had virtually had to protest .	268.54477
the deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him .	1360.4573
so , `` how about it ' ' ? ?	2.0975945
`` why single me out on this permit deal ' ' ? ?	92.01036
`` well , i ' ll tell you about that ' ' , lord told him .	95.939415
`` we aim t ' be see-lective , y ' know ? ?	515.24756
don ' t like to bother no one unless we have to , which i figger we do , in your case .	296.08868
figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you highlands big shots ' ' .	933.47876
he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him .	68.68952
he was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable .	375.34586
`` look , lord ' ' , he said hoarsely .	6938.2427
`` i know you ' ve got a grudge against me , and maybe i can ' t blame you .	117.26236
you think that highlands swindled you and i helped ' em do it .	283.52496
but you ' re all wrong , man ! !	16.776434
i just do what i ' m told , and ' ' --	18.949846
an ' that could mean trouble with a fella that ' s workin ' for crooks .	10065.408
you do that or take you out a permit right now ' ' .	111.75395
mcbride couldn ' t do either , of course .	4.0783916
not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes .	17.788485
to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible .	58.560745
how could he exert authority over them -- make them toe the line , as he had to -- if he knuckled under to this small-town clown ? ?	1389.7145
`` i ' ll get around to it a little later ' ' , he mumbled desperately .	396.8132
`` just as soon as i go to the bank , and ' ' --	43.78035
now , mis-ter mcbride ' ' , said lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss ' s arm .	259.09286
it was strictly the deputy ' s game , but mcbride had gone too far to throw in .	295.12427
now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world ' s coldest deck .	777.72687
he flung off lord ' s hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront .	3461.7134
it was practically the last move that mcbride made of his own volition .	218.78012
lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine .	841.11694
then , as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten , lord straightened him with an uppercut .	9020.49
and then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach	1165.515
but he couldn ' t keep up with them .	39.62576
no more could he defend himself against them .	11.036581
he seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen .	322.8591
and he could no longer think of face-saving , of honor , but only of escape .	177.12497
why , he ' s going to kill me , he thought wildly .	336.12268
i ' ve given willful hurt to no man .	93.50192
i was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he ' s going to kill me .	102.4043
beat me to death in front of a hundred people .	375.00845
somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go unpunished .	1324.2045
he , mcbride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically .	797.4057
mcbride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust .	4371.582
fear-maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again .	211.3609
he was long past the point of coherent thinking .	169.15323
dimly , he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly .	770.6645
he could not grasp that lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air .	2105.3518
he hated them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was lord ' s world .	562.43115
this , he was sure , was the way they would act	411.04767
laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death .	49.08852
donna , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him .	135.91203
she lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance .	3558.3135
when he regained consciousness he was in lord ' s house , in the office of doctor lord , the deputy ' s deceased father .	221.01057
the brannon outfit -- known as the slash-b because of its brand -- reached hondo creek before sundown .	14785.176
the herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night ' s bedground .	457.32196
two of the new hands , a mexican named jose amado and a kid known only as laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd .	4099.4897
the rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda .	770.3595
they got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie ' s fire , rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes , lounged about .	5407.231
there was some idle talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day ' s drive .	248.9305
but they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious the failure of the boss ' s wife and son to join the outfit .	411.0904
the cook , mateo garcia , had arrived there long before the herd .	736.9799
he ' d started a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon .	499.78983
he was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the dutch oven .	626.38025
the maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby .	788.76306
billie had unhitched the mules from both tom brannon ' s and his father ' s wagon .	206.0835
hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now .	107.58993
conchita kept an eye on the twins and little elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing .	841.82434
conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off tom brannon .	6957.8896
tom brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the maguires joined it , which had been at midday .	1471.7454
he ' d come alone , without his wife and child .	103.59372
he ' d been in an angry mood conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him .	2269.7534
she wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife .	44.824265
she wished that she could talk to her mother about it .	89.47283
not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it .	115.74693
but her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern .	148.88495
`` pat , get out of that creek ! !	76.22462
elena , you ' ll get mud all over your dress ' ' ! !	59.788742
tomas , she called him -- as the mexican hands did .	2507.1846
he was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , luis hernandez .	7872.6
it bothered her that she probably would never know .	89.20126
certainly , she wouldn ' t dare ask her father afterward .	897.075
he would tell her not to pry into grownups ' affairs -- as though she were a little kid like elena ! !	3533.6677
at the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything .	206.64961
they were sitting on their heels , rider-fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon .	2352.4817
brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him .	45.705055
he held a cigarette in his right hand .	12.144539
he ' d told hank maguire and luis hernandez about his wife ' s refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do .	207.8106
they were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned .	294.42346
finally hernandez said , `` i could offer you advice , tomas , but you wouldn ' t heed it ' ' .	252.5024
`` let ' s hear it , anyway ' ' .	3.9131784
let senora brannon live in her father ' s house for a time .	61.883713
after all , you want the senora as much as you want the boy .	110.48005
you need her even more than you need him ' ' .	6.5490346
`` she won ' t change her mind ' ' , brannon said .	219.6053
`` john clayton will see to that ' ' .	1.9913564
`` but after a time away from you .	97.081604
how long should i wait ' ' ? ?	1.0443494
`` in a year she ' ll like living in clayton ' s house too much to come back to me ' ' , brannon said flatly .	335.1196
`` and the boy will be too much under his influence by then .	498.97562
i ' ve got to take danny away from clayton before i lose him altogether .	1188.4829
hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father ' ' ! !	81.65998
`` but to take him and leave his mother behind is not good ' ' .	247.6548
`` in my place , you ' d follow such advice as you give me ' ' ? ?	91.21035
`` that i can ' t answer , for i can ' t imagine something like this happening to me .	154.16632
maybe i should withdraw my advice -- no ' ' ? ?	13.791435
what would you do in my place ' ' ? ?	2.9458144
`` i don ' t know , tom .	35.05553
like luis , i can ' t see something like this happening to me .	191.71384
with maria and me , there ' s never any problem .	231.94446
where i go , she goes -- and the kids with us .	530.21545
you ' re going to need your woman .	4.842117
if you take the one , you ' d better take both ' ' .	255.62296
`` i won ' t force beth to come against her will .	861.7219
but i ' m going to have my son ' ' .	10.736475
finally luis hernandez said , `` what must be , must be .	42.812363
i am with you , of course , tomas ' ' .	1282.4794
and hank maguire added , `` so am i , tom ' ' .	83.66006
`` all right ' ' , brannon said , rising .	279.34076
`` we ' ll ride out as soon as we ' ve had chuck ' ' .	40.30352
brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall .	639.8136
they had for cover both darkness and a summer storm .	1119.8317
during much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east .	336.2312
later , they ' d heard the rumble of thunder and then , just outside rockfork , they ran into rain .	994.4181
the others put on old coats or ducking jackets , whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles .	14784.81
there were seven of them , enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff .	420.82852
it was to be nothing more than that .	86.67407
if the bluff failed and they ran into trouble , brannon had told the others , they would withdraw -- and he would come after his son another time .	702.18964
he didn ' t want to put himself outside the law .	121.5946
with him were hank maguire , luis hernandez , and luis ' s son pedro .	2115.8525
the seventh man was red hogan , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising .	2822.6077
it was dark early , because of the storm .	2118.2068
also because of the storm , the streets of rockfork were deserted .	10368.411
they reined in before the town marshal ' s office , a box-sized building on main street .	284.78766
a lamp burned inside , but brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty .	272.53177
he ' d hoped to catch jesse macklin there .	152.17812
`` probably just stepped out ' ' , he said .	5.658526
the rest of you wait here ' ' .	2.750181
with red hogan , he rode to the welcome cafe .	5140.951
hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside .	112.11566
`` not there ' ' , he said , getting back onto his horse .	262.37695
`` maybe he ' s at the hotel ' ' .	4.136508
they rode to the rockfork house , a little farther along the opposite side of the street .	54.42039
they reined in there , brannon remaining in the saddle while hogan went to look for jesse macklin in the hotel dining room .	1989.4623
he ' d put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked .	4520.863
he was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain .	2449.5999
he hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder .	2181.7507
hogan reappeared , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal .	270.85754
`` he ' s finished eating ' ' , hogan said .	183.07791
`` sitting with a cup of coffee now .	20.490984
he and hogan waited by the door , one to either side .	266.49838
macklin was the third man to come out , and he came unhurriedly .	1417.8778
he was puffing on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain .	352.84348
it was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late .	173.99161
they closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun .	723.396
`` just come along ' ' , brannon told him .	66.227715
`` don ' t start anything you can ' t finish ' ' .	22.781322
`` now , listen ' ' -- macklin began .	423.88748
`` we ' ll talk over at your office ' ' .	20.718006
`` brannon , i warn you ' ' ! !	4.71615
`` let ' s go , marshal ' ' , brannon said , and took him by the arm .	168.71092
hogan gripped the lawman ' s other arm .	9.111054
they escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office .	123.41813
the other five slash-b men followed them inside , crowding the small room .	422.19925
his face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms .	183.11772
he looked at each of them in turn , brannon last of all .	2634.7725
`` i ' ll remember you ' ' , he said .	7.781881
`` put your gun on the desk , marshal ' ' .	195.87875
he lifted the skirt of macklin ' s coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk .	1095.8778
`` too much fooling around ' ' , he said .	9.697545
`` don ' t press your luck , badge-toter ' ' .	1175.7961
brannon said , `` now the key to the lockup , marshal ' ' .	670.2229
`` can ' t you guess ' ' ? ?	4.2433963
`` we ' re putting you where you won ' t come to harm .	87.54887
brannon , you ' ve assaulted a law officer and ' ' --	102.53496
they moved in on him , crowded him from all sides .	44.23646
no man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there .	72.82847
his face took on a sudden pallor , became beaded with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing .	374.3367
he held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure .	918.2478
he swore , and said , `` all right .	90.00524
it ' s here in my pocket ' ' .	1.6620723
`` get it out ' ' , brannon ordered .	165.47229
then , as macklin obeyed `` now let ' s go out back ' ' .	32.16788
resignedly , macklin turned to the back door .	5.854931
they followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear .	482.026
the door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron .	20048.422
macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door .	95.447975
they crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in .	317.82803
once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building .	398.9691
he was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door .	2903.7249
they returned to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on houston street .	313.01382
deputy marshal luke harper still stood guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark .	3442.267
he came to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun .	230.38199
`` don ' t try it ' ' , brannon told him , dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following .	2212.1838
`` don ' t get yourself killed for something that doesn ' t concern you ' ' .	125.85155
he strode past the now frightened man , entered the house .	90.29678
miguel and arturo ramirez remained on the veranda to keep harper from interfering .	1362.766
they trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house .	2151.4375
they brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle .	500.1114
they tracked mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet .	194.14192
their presence fouled the elegance of that room .	21.12831
and their arrival caught john clayton and charles ansley off guard .	46269.445
the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing .	3861.883
for men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second .	694.98645
but the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction .	875.56836
for , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them .	104.01846
the exception was an iron mountain settler named william lewis .	385.37265
after walking out to his corral that morning , he ' d been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet .	249.55565
a split second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded .	698.28174
he ' d mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he ' d estimated the shot had come .	405.93353
but he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted .	3676.4587
there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near .	393.96915
lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing .	734.2169
he hadn ' t even pretended to be farming his spread .	20277.764
he had done his rustling openly and boasted about it .	118.0228
he had received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them .	406.84622
he had cursed at them and threatened them .	15.677014
he was a man , those neighbors testified later , who didn ' t have a friend in the world .	42.94823
william lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone .	423.90427
`` i ' ll be ready next time ' ' ! !	10.935501
`` i ' ll be shootin ' right back ' ' .	11.957432
he had his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again .	137.90396
this time lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area .	601.50653
he found nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out .	129.85777
`` just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin ' coward face-to-face ' ' ! !	20416.408
`` that ' s all i ask ' ' ! !	6.408095
for the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time .	414.8828
a bullet smashed directly into the center of william lewis ' chest .	1168.6359
he slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself .	292.8167
two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground .	1867.3119
an inquest was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards .	379.00977
rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the stockgrowers ' association meeting had leaked out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting attorney , a colonel baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning .	1117.9894
he was finally found in the bates hole region of natrona county , two counties away .	1934.9342
prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment .	675.78015
for tom horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing .	749.6694
the former scout ' s alibi couldn ' t be shaken .	171.44398
he immediately rode on to cheyenne , threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends .	7454.538
`` dead center at three hundred yards , that coroner said ' ' ! !	348.07584
`` three shots in that fella ' fore he hit the ground ! !	396.94626
you reckon there ' s two men in this state can shoot like that ' ' ? ?	75.18849
privately , he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin .	362.8239
for a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he ' d promised to do .	140.75496
tom horn was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their money ' s worth .	778.63043
a good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats .	1046.2964
the company herds were being raided less often , and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted .	1824.0234
but there were other homesteaders who passed the lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors .	432.85266
the rustling problem was by no means solved .	20.009392
even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing .	561.03827
for less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on -- a blatant and defiant rustler named fred powell .	6085.633
`` fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle ' ' his own hired man , andy ross , mentioned later .	940.2507
`` everyone knew it , but he sort of acted like he didn ' t care who knew it -- even after them notes came , even after he ' d heard about lewis , even after he ' d been shot at a couple o ' times hisself ' ' ! !	267.07135
on the morning of september 10 , 1895 , powell and ross rose at dawn and began their day ' s work .	258.495
haying time was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack .	1128.1809
harnessing a team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed down and began chopping .	1632.6298
andy ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded .	518.9988
he looked around in surprise , then noticed that fred powell was clutching his chest .	1419.9698
the hired man ran over to help his boss .	1959.4769
`` my god , i ' m shot ' ' ! !	9.020325
ross had no intention of searching for the assassin .	10798.8125
he heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast .	634.2923
but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing .	614.26965
a detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman ' s hiding place .	642.0639
there were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .	1190.4158
not even an empty cartridge case could be found .	25.892982
once again , tom horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately .	216.64615
once again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready .	1535.24
later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of cheyenne , he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made .	1216.222
`` exterminatin ' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me ' ' , he ' d blandly announce .	451.03894
`` and i sort o ' got a corner on the market ' ' .	61.970764
`` tom ' ' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you bushwhacked them rustlers ? ?	3104.8271
they wouldn ' t o ' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down ' ' .	1192.0063
he had lots of friends , then as always .	3627.1526
even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend .	1445.6396
no man ' s name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo .	330.4422
`` well ' ' , he explained , `` s ' posin ' you was a nester swingin ' the long rope ? ?	6539.581
which would you be most scairt of -- a dry-gulchin ' or a shoot-down ' ' ? ?	906.8452
`` yeah , i can see that ' ' , the friend was forced to agree .	46.99072
`` but well , it just don ' t seem sportin ' somehow ' ' ! !	541.4083
`` i seen a lot o ' things in my time .	40.264446
i found a trooper once the apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they ' d caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o ' their skulls .	2473.6528
i heard o ' texas cattlemen wrappin ' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin ' the sun shrink ' em and squeeze him to death .	1840.9076
but there ' s one thing i never seen or heard of , one thing i just don ' t think there is , and that ' s a sportin ' way o ' killin ' a man ' ' ! !	310.29578
after the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored .	2895.2747
when fred powell ' s brother-in-law , charlie keane , moved into the dead man ' s home , the anonymous letter writer took no chances on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice	875.335
if you don ' t leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as powell ' s was .	278.3469
this was the message found tacked to the cabin door .	1113.257
all through albany and laramie counties , other men were doing the same .	123.71131
houses of settlers who ' d treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards .	827.95233
the small half-heartedly tended fields of men who ' d spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow .	17196.03
no cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer .	418.70877
jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated .	495.418
for three straight years , tom horn patrolled the southern wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after lewis and powell ( if he killed lewis and powell ) will never be known .	656.3586
it is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state .	926.8581
it is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him .	428.36478
for that legend was growing explosively , rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man .	398.67624
( the best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found .	747.43274
) rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim ' s head as a sort of trademark .	560.9792
( a detailed search of old coroner ' s reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest .	940.557
one thing was certain -- his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary .	554.8109
the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week .	2221.0667
`` my reputation ' s my stock in trade ' ' , tom mentioned more than once .	244.55545
he evidently couldn ' t foresee that it might be his downfall in the end .	188.84612
he had made himself the personification of the devil to the homesteaders .	1941.1213
but to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure .	906.8357
such ranchers as coble and clay and the bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown .	1583.6309
he made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups .	1261.6393
in the cow camps , tom horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos .	489.17993
the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life .	923.7422
the wailing , guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him .	4825.0894
by 1898 , rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in wyoming .	213.09492
when several minutes had passed and curt hadn ' t emerged from the livery stable , brenner reentered the hotel and faced summers across the counter .	6928.701
`` i have a little job for you , charlie .	2357.9485
i ' m sure you won ' t mind doing me a small favor ' ' .	382.72003
brenner ' s voice was oily , but summers wasn ' t fooled .	2058.3425
`` what is it you want me to do , mr . brenner ' ' ? ?	252.55873
i just want you to take a message to diane molinari .	5210.766
tell her to come here to the hotel ' ' .	5.207243
vastly relieved , summers nodded and started toward the door .	14.6797695
`` one thing , summers ' ' , brenner said .	8603.637
`` you ' re not to mention my name .	29.681519
tell her curt adams wants to see her ' ' .	3.2853043
summers pulled up short , and turned around .	136.33601
`` i don ' t know , mr . brenner ' ' , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling of brenner ' s plans .	816.8273
`` it doesn ' t seem quite right , telling her a thing like that .	347.98038
couldn ' t i just ' ' -- his voice trailed off into silence .	1386.9241
brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold .	262.30502
he turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn ' t before noticed .	647.77673
`` you know , summers ' ' , he said thoughtfully .	158.03358
`` eagle ' s nest ought to have a fire company .	160.87941
if someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a haystack ' ' .	238.48434
he started toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` tell her to come to adams ' s room , that adams is in trouble .	210.90604
his face pale , summers headed for the street .	182.92502
curt ' s visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching .	807.4973
he paused only long enough to ascertain that jess ' s buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside .	841.2626
the fact that jess ' s horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that diane ' s information had been wrong , but curt didn ' t interpret it this way .	371.209
a man like jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed .	410.8206
probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding .	572.73975
from the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach black ' s house without using the street .	378.79965
curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees .	217.1895
there was a light in black ' s front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior .	2035.3265
curt circled the house and located a barn out back .	195.1443
he could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else .	81.18271
there was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfastened .	22825.314
he opened the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him .	634.87634
again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor .	818.23883
he moved ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden partition .	87.28576
horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws .	2184.654
he found a match in his pocket and lit it .	808.0535
it was certain now that jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was stacey black .	308.99115
curt wanted to get jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner .	957.30664
he studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved .	134.3325
reaching across the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the rump .	17869.312
the startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall .	1774.5052
as curt had hoped , the house door banged open .	41866.508
he slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall .	4265.711
curt moved over beside the door and waited .	17.38689
presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and jess ' s smothered curses .	8453.288
the door swung open , and jess said sourly , `` what the hell ' s the matter with you ? ?	150.71045
curt doubted that any animal belonging to jess would find much reassurance in its owner ' s voice .	243.56311
jess cursed again , and entered the barn .	10.083803
a match flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop .	693.5272
as he crossed to the side of the stall , curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer .	6888.294
`` before you try anything ' ' , he said .	7.3173504
`` remember what happened to gruller ' ' .	3.39137
he started to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it .	555.6966
`` that ' s the stuff ' ' , curt said .	2995.3806
`` just hold it that way ' ' .	2.284896
he reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt .	648.0396
`` you and i have a little talking to do , jess .	2489.47
you won ' t be needing this ' ' .	1.6748222
he moved up and lifted jess ' s pistol out of its holster .	1987.9413
`` damn you , adams ' ' -- jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock .	1746.2861
`` we ain ' t got nothing to talk about .	110.76737
if i don ' t come back in the house , breed ' s going to ' ' --	83.68092
`` your trigger-happy brother isn ' t in the house .	31.704355
about now he ' s probably having supper .	7.7448792
that long ride the four of you took must ' ve given him a good appetite .	610.22186
now turn around so i can see your face ' ' .	7.02128
there was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen .	663.52167
`` you ' re about as dumb as they come , adams .	369.5788
i don ' t know what you ' re up to , but when brenner ' ' --	291.53568
`` you can forget about brenner , too ' ' , curt said .	352.02704
`` it ' s ben arbuckle we ' re going to talk about ' ' .	19.048605
`` i don ' t know nothin ' about him ' ' .	33.018875
i suppose you don ' t know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either	682.50555
one with blood all over it , arbuckle ' s blood ' ' .	17.065845
curt ' s fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun .	266.94824
`` so help me , crouch , i ' d like to kill you where you stand , but , before i do , i ' m going to hear you admit killing him .	115.94225
curt was holding jess ' s gun in his left hand .	62.30424
he drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across jess ' s face , but didn ' t finish the motion .	941.80774
pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like jess , but curt couldn ' t bring himself to do it .	1277.1553
apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , jess became bold .	2392.3813
`` having all the guns makes you a big man , don ' t it , adams ? ?	89.68128
if we was both armed , you wouldn ' t talk so tough ' ' .	45.331287
curt reached out and dropped jess ' s pistol back into the holster .	1621.7059
he retreated a step and holstered his own .	186.14879
sweat bubbled out on jess ' s swarthy face .	382.87082
the fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw , but he didn ' t reach for the gun .	122.974075
curt , angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high .	938.99567
`` does this make it any easier , coward ' ' ? ?	156.50832
`` i ain ' t drawin ' against you ' ' , jess said thickly .	1533.688
you ' re the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club .	909.8186
i just wanted to hear you say so ' ' .	3.0946844
jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides .	158.85143
he had found curt ' s weakness , or what to jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it .	313.5268
somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed .	34.129745
curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention .	57.651356
he had to make jess talk , and he had to do it before stacey black got curious and came to investigate .	1135.4988
once more he lifted jess ' s gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin .	2275.4363
`` we ' ll do it another way , then ' ' , he said harshly .	66.374596
jess ' s coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by curt ' s fist .	2498.674
with a roar of pain and fury jess made his attack .	137.37085
curt managed to duck beneath the man ' s flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to jess ' s mid-section .	3322.0725
it was like hitting a sack of salt .	4.9155765
pain shot up curt ' s arm clear to the shoulder , but jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit .	438.38727
he slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning .	4674.617
an inch lower and it would have knocked him out .	38.17444
as it was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move .	26.693981
when his eyes began to focus , he saw jess charging at him with a pitchfork .	26023.934
curt twisted to one side , and the tines of the fork bit into the floor .	701.33563
jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose .	193.70047
it gave curt time to stagger to his feet .	17.532614
the tines broke off under jess ' s twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock curt ' s brains out .	894.59235
so the pitchfork whistled over curt ' s head .	121.075096
he stepped inside jess ' s guard and landed two blows to the big man ' s belly , putting everything he had behind them .	480.25394
when his head came down , curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall .	437.21234
the building shook , setting the lantern to swaying , and the buckskin to pitching again .	3233.418
even black ' s old crowbait began to snort , and from the house black yelled , `` jess ! !	2183.972
what ' s going on out there ' ' ? ?	3.2378614
jess didn ' t seem too sure himself .	6.6772656
he lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall .	66.167015
curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor .	163.56172
blood gushed from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from curt ' s fists .	804.07117
curt was in almost as bad shape , but he wouldn ' t quit .	84.54585
he backed jess into a corner , grabbed a handful of the man ' s shirtfront , and drew back his right fist .	235.40523
you killed him , didn ' t you ' ' ? ?	5.1684275
`` it was brenner ' s idea ' ' , jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose .	11412.738
`` he found out about you and arbuckle talking .	311.28305
he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble ' ' .	82.29272
`` you mean anyone who stood up for his rights ' ' , curt said .	303.45383
he let go of the shirt , and jess slumped to the floor .	8380.3
turning his back , curt crossed to the stall , reached over to untie the buckskin ' s halter rope , and waved his hand in the animal ' s face .	1637.9454
curt moved in and picked up his gun .	4.079513
he shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster .	496.687
leaving jess ' s where it lay , he left the stall .	289.69205
jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door .	7093.369
`` who ' s in there ' ' ? ?	7.220452
curt opened the door , grabbed black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn .	104.624146
`` you ' re staying right here for a while .	106.26916
i ' m going to let him tell it to somebody else ' ' .	42.94688
he shoved black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at jess .	5121.553
you ' re coming along peacefully , or i ' ll put a bullet in your leg ' ' .	55.089508
curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it .	668.9917
black would have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes .	89.52836
`` where ' re you takin ' me ' ' ? ?	6.2642303
`` we ' re going to marshal woods ' s house .	13.0649605
maybe if the marshal hears this himself , it ' ll make a difference .	95.27477
somebody in this town must still have some backbone ' ' .	154.25008
over his shoulder he could see max ' s loose grin and the burnsides ' glowering faces .	3182.1775
`` soon as we send them on their way and make camp , let ' s you and me go for a walk down by the snake -- all by ourselves ' ' .	186.13884
`` sally ' ' , admonished her mother , `` you ' ve got all evening to visit with dan .	208.67764
mrs . jackson ' s words recalled dan to his lack of fitness for courting .	1264.2463
what a spectacle he was , caked with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an indian , kissing the finest , the sweetest , the bravest , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world .	1114.4604
he released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with old hap .	3494.4382
`` got a lot to tend to , but i ' ll get back quick as i can ' ' , he assured her .	92.52547
dan could hear clayton burnside and eben jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen .	26130.371
so long as sally ' s pa was coming out best on the haggle , dan didn ' t feel the need of putting in his two-bits ' worth .	1079.4467
soon as the burnsides moved on , he ' d lead rex down by the river	2008.0969
there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening .	73.22753
damn it , he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve .	579.49713
if i hadn ' t got nate stopped when i did , my duds ' d all be shot plumb to hell ! !	2638.494
he stooped , picked up his ruined hat , and pursed his lips thoughtfully .	706.4273
from the way the wound in his head was itching , dan knew that it would heal .	6579.191
but his only hat was something else again .	6.110364
the burnsides , now ready to roll , were purposefully deaf to his cry .	5510.4673
he bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him .	25.041533
`` i ain ' t going to fight you no more ' ' .	28.46954
nate turned his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice .	757.43896
`` i know you ain ' t ' ' ! !	4.3770423
he moved in close , jerked the handsome , broad-brimmed beaver hat from nate ' s head and clamped it on his own .	2017.9039
`` here ' s a present for you ' ' , he said , shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over nate ' s purpling forehead .	2340.5608
`` me and you ' s trading hats so ' s you ' ll have something permanent to remember me by ' ' ! !	133.76868
sally left her choring to stand beside dan .	6.2471085
slipping her hand in his , they silently watched the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight .	1347.913
much as they had to look forward to , they didn ' t begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go .	140.53546
at first matilda could not believe her own eyes .	28.36963
she had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of dan and finding nothing but emptiness .	2003.5873
and now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon .	5811.417
seeing them waiting there at the foot of emigrant rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , matilda could not speak at all .	1334.941
then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` pa ! !	1967.4791
and he ' s with the jacksons ' ' ! !	8.59528
hez asked , who still believed they ' d have them to lick .	600.07184
`` they ain ' t even in sight ' ' ! !	7.2949514
by then hez could see for himself , and so could the others .	208.21895
soon they were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again .	178.7202
but even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day .	89.39884
nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires .	1124.222
then , and only then , with the jacksons and dan as their true guests of honor , did the harrows take time to catch up on the news .	2292.1948
no sooner did they hear of dan ' s injury than both gran and matilda went into immediate action .	5366.497
the wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals .	7060.999
from then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food .	500.70316
even sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag ' ' .	2090.4707
after their supper , the evening turned into a regular `` hoe-down ' ' .	138.0859
only , they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the virginia reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration .	2346.3838
but with bill o ' connor on the fiddle , and gran harrow exuberantly shouting `` glory be ' ' and `` hallelujah ' ' above their united chant of the lilting old ballads , they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration .	4016.918
`` golly ' ' , rod exclaimed to harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators , `` don ' t that fiddle make you wish the bible didn ' t say us baptists can ' t dance ' ' ? ?	823.2275
`` nor methodists , neither ' ' , she replied .	50.08532
`` not that it matters to me , being this far along ' ' .	195.81729
rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied .	308.04227
`` come spring , you ' ll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too , gal ' ' .	2552.7385
at these words of sympathy and understanding , harmony said generously , `` i don ' t mind setting here along with gran while you go out and join in the games ' ' .	525.7495
rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , `` i ain ' t much of a hand for dare-base and farmer-in-the-dell , but i ' d sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles ' ' .	384.35687
he looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers .	23725.133
`` don ' t reckon there ' s nobody out there , ' cept maybe dan , who can outgrip me , harmony ' ' .	3740.685
with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs . jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , harmony settled on the edge of the grub box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs , and worried about all that might have happened to sally .	624.58716
and she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , `` farmer in the dell , farmer in the dell , heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell ' ' .	880.7532
at the sight of sally ' s happy face and carefree expression , harmony ' s dark , brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears .	5730.389
she was glad , completely and unselfishly glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both sally and dan .	357.99017
and she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they ' d be just as right as they now were for her and for rod .	492.59177
but she couldn ' t , not yet .	24.659513
not with the memory of her folks and the lost conestoga still holding her close .	6650.741
out in the center of the circle the farmer , who was dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , `` the farmer choose his wife ' ' .	258.29675
with a swift swoop of his big arms , he grabbed sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their `` outfit ' ' .	1005.89343
soon the child , the dog , the cat and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle .	355.12656
by now harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them .	1326.0167
no matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal .	610.6539
even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness .	602.8483
already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains .	1590.249
soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them .	87.77839
no sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep .	757.95337
for matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night .	199.33925
even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains .	556.2883
`` my souls ' a-gracious ' ' ! !	1.0268995
gran harrow exclaimed , watching their rippling muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load .	703.844
`` a body would swear i floated right up here on a cloud ' ' ! !	99.89301
rod and dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins .	20075.705
`` shucks , gran ' ' , they said almost in unison .	11711.05
`` that wasn ' t nothing at all ' ' ! !	8.80965
leaning forward in her chair , gran nearsightedly scrutinized dan ' s face .	5120.811
`` quit ragging him , gran ' ' , rod protested .	3154.5212
`` i ain ' t ragging him ' ' ! !	7.9312587
gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing dan ' s upper lip .	4462.461
`` but honest-to-betsy , i ' ve seed more hair than that on a piece o ' bacon ' ' .	507.86517
the two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with alice .	1426.3813
`` rheumatics worse , pa ' ' ? ?	1.0630636
dan asked hez , who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends .	1189.7689
`` my right leg ' s stiff as a board this morning ' ' , he replied .	172.75354
`` but the sun ' ll fry it out ' n me onct we git to rolling ' ' .	5726.024
the three men stepped out to the side to wait for captain clemens ' signal .	709.94434
hez looked up at the high face of emigrant rock , official signboard for the raft river turnoff , and gloated , `` seems funny that them burnsides never took time to leave their john-henry up thar ' ' .	7035.5977
`` wonder what made them hurry so ' ' , rod drawled , giving dan a sly wink .	14914.772
`` from now on , sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and rod ' s outfit ' ' .	449.05777
`` ain ' t no sense you eating our dust ' ' , rod protested .	619.3212
`` sally and her ma want to trade off on account of harmony being so far along ' ' , dan explained .	609.1509
`` jackson recruited his critters , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up .	705.17395
he ' s got the tightest running gear in the train now .	105.60861
besides , ' tain ' t no more ' n right for me to follow with my black oxen , so ' s i can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch ' ' .	451.80566
captain clemens ' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams .	2423.043
`` reckon ye ' re right , dan ' ' , hez called back over his shoulder .	874.1662
`` i ' ll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o ' the canyon ' ' .	382.54196
`` we ' ll double teams zigzagging up the mountain , harmony ' ' , he spoke reassuringly , concerned by the pinched look around her mouth .	458.59268
`` like enough we ' ll all be up on top by sundown ' ' .	223.64905
out of the corner of his eye , he could see his father ' s wheels beginning to turn .	244.16965
before harmony had a chance to reply , rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen ' s backs .	3928.854
while no larger than dutch springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous .	3658.6177
men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about .	2147.043
although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them .	2511.7102
`` gyp ' ll be holdin ' forth in some bar if he ' s here at all ' ' , cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs .	366.99365
there were no less than six or seven saloons in ganado , not counting the lower class dives , all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters .	4879.2104
`` take one side of the street , and i ' ll take the other ' ' , he proposed .	32.396748
`` if you spot carmer give a yell before you move in ' ' .	65.123146
it ' s all i ask , stevens ' ' .	2.9309022
separating , they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars .	5574.9067
russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero .	167.73573
suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate gyp carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief .	7467.916
he tramped out of the miners rest with his hopes plummeting , and headed doggedly for the palace saloon , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street .	551.3784
the palace was an elaborate establishment , built practically on stilts in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch .	925.70483
behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird ' s nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside .	588.4163
russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch .	7870.341
the front windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior .	493.49646
heading for the batwings , cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window , and suddenly dodged aside .	1105.1641
nerves tight as a bowstring , he paused to gather his wits .	369.46906
against all expectation , carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him .	1985.2726
he fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot .	5335.913
reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below .	5211.1934
muffling an exclamation , russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down .	775.80084
as luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before pat appeared .	1216.5399
`` what luck , cobb ' ' ? ?	1.0648049
`` he ' s there ' ' , he got out tersely , curbing his rising excitement .	1622.8114
hitching his cartridge belt around , pat glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb at his side .	767.9609
climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door .	89.063095
forced behind him momentarily , russ followed at once and halted two steps inside .	1269.2296
while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with gyp carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday .	3920.0437
a man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track , and another dozed at one of the card tables .	379.6854
two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass .	2040.5109
looking the setup over , stevens started coolly for the rear of the place .	68.89299
`` where yuh goin ' ' ' ? ?	1.0784627
halting , pat turned to survey him deliberately .	91.137924
he did not reply , going on toward the back .	56.905384
less assured than the tall , wide-shouldered man in the lead , cobb followed alertly , a hand on his gun butt .	1396.9451
the bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it .	169.77933
a hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell .	1835.804
small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side .	92.32477
all the doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder .	908.6957
a single kick made it spring open , shuddering .	11263.899
pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward , a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike .	22945.68
russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside .	6.5373406
but he was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled .	1800.9504
he started to struggle up , heaving desperately .	13.134697
russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach .	159.09856
kneeling , cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned .	353.31
i ' ve drawn his fangs ' ' , he snapped .	100.13656
`` go through his pockets , will you ? ?	7.5587783
if we have to we ' ll take him apart and see what he ' s made of ' ' ! !	147.84682
complying methodically , pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing .	688.9746
cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment .	3925.1912
stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly rose and lunged toward carmer ' s hat , which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell .	7107.488
straightening up , his eyes ablaze , he held out the battered stetson .	6047.9673
inside the crown , stuffed behind the stained sweatband , could be seen thin , crumpled wads of currency .	10757.358
carmer ' s ingenious cache for his loot had been found .	49.491695
you were right ' ' , russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of carmer ' s hat .	1061.094
`` that is , if we can be sure this is colcord ' s money ' ' --	400.66473
`` where else would he get it ? ?	1.0105151
russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly .	3573.0205
`` it ' s within a hundred of what crip had ' ' , he declared .	510.0596
`` we know penny spent some -- and carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on ' ' .	748.4274
handing the money over , russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean .	3918.7502
`` shall we get out of here ' ' ? ?	2.386719
leaving the card room , they moved back through the palace the way they had come .	133.09291
glowering looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them .	62.00736
pausing in the outside door to glance behind him , pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out .	2832.6892
he and cobb clattered down the high steps to the street .	26.696318
pat paused there , looking across at the young fellow .	2558.4111
it ' ll be a pleasure for you to return this money to colcord and tell him about it , russ ' ' .	571.0727
to his faint surprise russ held up his hand .	35.73248
`` not me ' ' , he ruled decidedly .	10652.786
it was you that tracked it down anyway , stevens ' ' , he pursued strictly .	451.21014
`` i ' ll shove along home ' ' .	1.6149786
pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered .	31502.385
`` you owe it to penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really ' ' , he observed mildly .	265.69672
`` he ' ll know when you tell him .	25.896084
but i want this to sink in awhile .	6.835411
then maybe next time he won ' t be so quick on the trigger ' ' .	118.94705
`` pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs .	82.97062
`` you ' re the doctor ' ' , he returned with a smile .	74.382614
`` but i still think penny ' s an awful nice girl , russ ' ' --	770.9747
`` you don ' t have to tell me ' ' , flashed cobb .	552.2559
giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street .	1666.7194
pat let him go , following more leisurely .	23.164602
at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for antler .	905.3322
the truth was , the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck .	4107.814
`` penny ' s always glad to see me over there ' ' , he mused bleakly .	1273.075
yet had he not visited the girl at saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle .	947.88916
over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of chuck stober ' s part in recent events .	810.33734
`` gyp carmer couldn ' t have known about colcord ' s money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him ' ' ? ?	180.4894
`` it ' s the second time war ax hands made a play for that money .	2626.168
how much of an accident could that be ' ' ? ?	21.84456
nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun .	340.7391
in town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot	1296.9596
but on the range gunfire had a meaning .	42.659973
two minutes later it came again -- a double explosion , followed by a third , sounding more distant .	481.5268
as near as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the antler ranch house .	543.89417
so far as he knew , only his father could be there .	96.88054
clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm .	2724.1394
his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing .	13871.278
still a quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed .	998.7187
setting a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face .	2291.6821
when it was followed by a second , whining even closer , cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression .	18207.7
he knew now what he was up against .	3913.0105
whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the antler house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight .	655.7223
cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , russ drew his colt and examined it briefly .	1449.9626
if he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer a moment later .	570.22455
he ain ' t gone far ' ' ! !	30.897612
a harsh cry floated to him across the brush .	221.20308
a carbine cracked more loudly , and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side .	1274.9337
the would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close .	20.565048
toward the west this depression led toward a draw .	561.49835
leading his pony , he hurried that way , not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range .	578.76
swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the meandering draw .	607.5945
he had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind .	895.33484
he had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot .	1903.6029
a shot or two went wild before cobb felt something tug at his foot .	2686.7952
a slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away .	251.04538
a second twitched his shirtsleeve , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm .	641.4005
let ' s get out of here ' ' ! !	4.762346
at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw .	260.6229
the long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless .	10157.092
sweeping a look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment .	66.17156
he heard cries from behind him , but he could make out no words .	151.4269
he dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it .	95.32786
recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunged forward with undiminished speed .	3569.8362
gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range .	2849.197
he clambered out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about .	1051.5978
early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions .	1013.4923
and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat record .	313.3797
every plane that could fly was sent into the air .	11.704334
cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan .	2442.64
anything the enemy flew or floated was his target .	629.50745
fleischman with eight was to patrol the leyte gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships .	849.1639
greg himself took two flights , with todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around ormoc on the east coast of leyte .	903.4368
a weapons carrier took greg , todman , belton , banjo ferguson , and walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip .	2242.9346
it was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes .	2458.4404
there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever .	1355.0759
the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle .	19015.854
donovan snatched greg ' s chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it .	228.8675
his face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot .	184.34364
greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before .	45.294525
but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure .	4028.8342
`` i ' ve got her as neat as i can ' ' , donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the seton harness over greg ' s shoulders .	2078.1653
it ' s for carabao not airplanes ' ' .	1.5274776
don ' t you worry , chief ' ' , greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it .	930.4697
see you ' ' , donovan said as he jumped off the wing .	253.3855
the expression was his trade-mark , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return .	421.99738
at the prearranged time , greg started the engine and taxied out .	1468.3855
from the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip .	310.59686
he wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission .	317.7839
yet long before the scheduled time for return , donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky .	1501.6418
greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him .	280.57535
the dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful .	3760.25
the control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan .	423.45615
greg ' s mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again .	1316.2266
to the west , the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes .	992.2005
underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray .	11150.979
water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers .	1542.3156
the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it .	2818.7073
he possessed the fighter pilot ' s horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory .	375.49356
as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it .	362.34827
they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar and hope that it didn ' t close in before they returned .	1237.9292
greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .	9.252487
`` todman , let ' s try to go under this stuff .	479.19208
stay in close and we ' ll go up the valley ' ' .	20.922354
`` roger , sweeney ' ' , todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above greg .	2143.943
greg took the formation wide around three a-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf .	696.69226
he dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain .	666.8731
the valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn .	2696.8352
it was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia .	3468.22
the ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in .	1409.4315
if the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .	33.076416
when the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out .	166.12761
he spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast .	161.26628
although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .	614.64087
once todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him .	3718.2246
`` somebody beat us to it ' ' ! !	16.986864
todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation .	294.19135
visibility continued to be limited , and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet .	228.21428
his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights .	792.8378
he thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill .	32005.404
but greg ' s area remained as placid as a florida dawn .	982.6458
finally , as time began to run out , he headed into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies .	3895.6516
there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run .	6049.687
one of greg ' s bombs hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it .	101.86687
only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle .	2184.6052
with their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily .	5346.3857
greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home .	234.18846
like a man making a deep dive , greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley .	1668.1544
he was about to make a gas check on his flight when todman ' s voice broke in `` sweeneys ! !	2451.854
greg ' s eyes flicked up from his instrument panel .	2371.88
he saw them , specks against the gray , but closing fast .	1107.4087
they were headed straight for each other on a collision course .	347.69147
and only a few seconds to answer it .	8.560651
and then he thought todman might be right .	8.26825
his mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification .	706.0817
he narrowed the shape down to two either a zero or a u . s . navy type aircraft .	184.15363
if it were the enemy , tactically his position was correct .	495.44803
japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , american on speed and firepower .	11730.097
his present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages .	254.61363
but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn ' t been spotted already .	152.98804
but the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course .	2771.82
todman , you take the one on the left .	48.251007
greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` rogers ' ' .	246.34804
the planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully .	6117.6196
greg ' s airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees .	656.5627
there was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them .	85.34558
but they could turn and escape to the east .	222.16026
`` todman , drop your second element back .	4.910413
if any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces .	36.514996
now let ' s make sure they ' re japs ' ' .	521.39545
even as he said it , greg knew they had found the enemy .	68.27796
the shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom .	5400.181
greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight .	718.1653
the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him .	390.84866
`` arm your guns , sweeneys ' ' .	3.0303996
they ' re japs ' ' , came a high-pitched voice .	530.8831
you ' ll bust your ass in this canyon .	979.4905
he moved the flights over against one wall .	8.3636875
it gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery .	2752.7188
if the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out .	921.89496
a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done .	85.69081
greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the rpm , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting .	599.2441
the clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around .	545.5779
`` they haven ' t seen us ' ' , greg yelled to himself over the engine noise .	2878.9636
`` they haven ' t seen us ' ' .	1.5406144
he hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag .	18209.316
out of the corner of his eye , he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him .	1382.507
with the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done .	187.77927
just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board .	1786.2198
please , dear god , make my pilots good , he prayed .	258.04514
he took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another .	534.4966
it did not seem possible that they hadn ' t been spotted .	250.05736
greg ' s fingers closed on the stick trigger .	9557.842
six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished .	1744.2922
as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them .	520.3483
greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered .	23.655186
his burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane .	126.82138
the jap ' s propeller flew off in pieces .	287.70877
it was all greg had time to see .	27.281487
his maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost inverted and heading up into the clouds .	1077.1951
if he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground .	128.72815
he pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .	213.15173
he had no idea which was up and which was down .	285.76544
he held the controls where they had been .	134.96802
sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip .	3910.5632
his air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out .	452.53162
over the rattling of fenders , humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles .	4443.1016
cool air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat .	10377.226
`` moriarty ' ' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone i once more repeated the absurdity , mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced .	2854.593
we were coming to an intersection , turning right , chuffing to a stop .	483.2393
forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old mexican moriarty , new mexico .	517.91797
adios ' ' , i said , exhausting my spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host ' s daughters .	4715.641
i waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass .	2684.6538
gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold .	210.68802
white-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze .	16141.284
suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumbing hopefully , i saw emergent in windshield flash red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and -- ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair -- the leering face of old herry .	6169.859
`` mor-ee-air-teeeee ' ' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde .	13752.507
over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage herry ' s black brushcut was just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where -- hidden -- more delicately-textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes .	11921.888
i would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and -- well , at least i wouldn ' t have shouted back a taunt .	1248.5586
still nursing anger i listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me .	11819.549
just as i straightened up with my duffel bag , i heard `` sahjunt yoorick , meet mrs . major j . a . roebuck ' ' .	3491.4167
the voice was that of johnson , tail gunner off another crew .	45359.586
squeezing a look between johnson ' s fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired `` y ' all drahve ' ' ? ?	5538.834
`` onleh one thiihng ' ' , mrs . roebuck continued .	3684.128
but corporal johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t ' hi-im ' ' .	18350.664
i said that it didn ' t make any difference to me either , as far as i knew .	97.55202
how far i knew will shortly become apparent .	9.365608
let me pass over the trip to sante fe with something of the same speed which made mrs . roebuck `` wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit ' ' ( 35 m . p . h . ) `` is still in ee-faket ' ' .	1611.609
i let up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 m . p . h . which would , i hoped , overhaul herry and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had i , mrs . major roebuck settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs . somebody in sante fe .	2570.9905
when johnson ejaculated `` howsabout my buying us all a nice cold co-cola , ma ' am ' ' ? ?	536.608
mrs . roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son , who was `` onleh a little younguh than you bawhs ' ' .	706.7767
johnson never would have believed she had a son that age .	999.78357
mrs . roebuck thought johnson was a `` sweet bawh t ' lah lahk thet ' ' , but her herman was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it .	3893.1335
just as p ' lite an -- an cohnfidunt , an ah says ' uh coahse you cain ' t ' , but he says ' whah nawt , you ah hevin one ' ? ?	21085.518
an ah coudn ansuh him an so ah said ' aw right , ah gay-ess , an his fathuh didn uttuh one wohd an aftuh huhmun was gone , the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t ' gethuh f ' ovuh a yeah , onleh an occasional one , but just the same it was behahn mah back , an ah doan think thet ' s nahce at all , d ' you ' ' ? ?	38914.133
`` no , i don ' t ' ' , johnson said .	50.415894
`` i ' m a good baptist , and drinking ' '	160.78047
mrs . roebuck very kindly let me drive through sante fe to a road which would , she said , lead us to taos and then raton and `` eventshahleh ' ' out of new mexico .	1498.7203
how lightly her `` eventshah-leh ' ' passed into the crannies where i was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus , and how the word would echo .	2980.2163
hardly had mrs . roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck , father or grandfather of senor `` moriarty ' s ' ' ford sedan , came screeching to a dust-swirling stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window .	3120.2031
the straight , black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back .	1185.0175
johnson unwired the right hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely loosely-taped fragments of glass , and johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer .	1363.3075
`` in back , buddy ' ' , the driver said to me .	65.46481
quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack , i stepped on the running board	2534.9429
i seized the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag -- and merely wrecking my camera , i was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report .	2679.4668
i was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck ' s similarity to senor x ' s ford turtle .	5809.455
maybe i would beat old herry to siberia after all .	85.47794
i drew back , drawing back my foot for a kick .	125.56467
but it was only johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing , which half covered the truck cab ' s glassless rear window .	4973.8647
the way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth i thought he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear .	522.71954
`` hell , yes ' ' , i roared back between dusty lips .	4749.4316
gracias ' ' , i hollered , my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my spanish vocabulary .	1551.1046
at once my ears were drowned by a flow of what i took to be spanish , but -- the driver ' s white teeth flashing at me , the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair , beyond his gesticulating bottle -- it could have been the purest oxford english i was half hearing	1910.4684
i wouldn ' t have known the difference .	50.721466
johnson was trying to grab the wheel , though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it .	402.64664
white teeth suddenly vanishing , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against johnson ' s ear .	159.51414
we were off the road , gleaming barbed wire pulling taut .	3390.9624
i ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards .	2003.5194
we were in a field , in a tight , screeching turn .	3911.3872
prairie dogs were popping up and popping down .	3.583813
just as i got to my knees , there was again the sound of the fence stretching , and i had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously .	668.9136
this time no wire came whipping into the truck .	784.1837
i regained my squatting position behind the truck cab ' s rear window .	262.6223
johnson ' s left hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers .	1632.941
`` tee-wah ' ' , the driver cackled , his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing .	14862.761
you thought i was a mexican , didn ' t you , buddy ' ' ? ?	28.311852
`` hell , that ' s all right , buddy ' ' , the indian ( i now guessed ) said .	324.34302
miraculously , the bottle was still in my hand , foam still geysering over my ( luckily ) waterproof watch .	20445.889
no sooner had i started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck .	17142.617
teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of spanish in which `` amigo ' ' appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound .	1159.1727
i bobbed my head each time it appeared .	36.22805
suddenly the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son of a bitch ' ' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into johnson ' s quivering ribs .	2295.033
a big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning .	31360.902
beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way .	434.4927
the car was just about to us , its driver ' s fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in sante fe -- on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue .	1233.0118
high , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car ' s steel roof .	531.79926
on unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash .	22034.113
the indian was again raising his bottle , but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of johnson ' s -- the bottle this time went to the indian ' s lips .	486.2761
another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill .	1062.2351
i started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod -- anything i could throw and with better aim than i had thrown the beer bottle .	1406.7982
in the ditch sand was white and soft-looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming .	12783.806
but johnson couldn ' t quickly unwire the truck door , and if i escaped , he might suffer .	349.28125
on the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery	182.20024
with more time i could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin --	20847.975
suddenly and not a second too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket .	197.5482
i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile .	5103.572
there was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash	411.1212
the car ' s far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center .	189.17444
i heard the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me .	1033.3989
looking back i saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number .	872.1361
johnson ' s fat hand , another bottle were protruding from the truck cab , and that self-proclaimed baptist teetotaler , had a bottle at his own lips .	1636.487
two cars came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing .	12006.961
the indian ' s arm whipped sidewise -- there was a flash of amber and froth , the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car .	815.4224
i saw johnson ' s bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car .	553.7973
this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women .	5755.643
i looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car ' s rear window .	107.39398
`` drink , you son of a bitch ' ' ! !	8.658161
i quickly turned around and began to drink .	34.045326
but the indian was jabbing another bottle toward johnson .	1515.2976
i guided her to the divan , turned off the tv , faced her .	754.4784
she sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes .	224.97556
big and dark , a melting , golden brown .	168.50406
eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled .	45.300983
plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them .	251.33908
it was a disturbingly familiar face , too , but i couldn ' t remember where we had met .	46.231697
i said , `` do we know each other , miss ' ' ? ?	71.62293
`` no , i remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all i could think of was ' ' -- this time she stopped the rush of words herself .	231.05583
`` but one word at a time , o . k . ' ' ? ?	34.63811
she was still hugging the stained coat around her , so i said , `` relax , let me take your things .	178.8254
would you like a drink , or coffee ' ' ? ?	4.937668
she stood up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let out a high-pitched scream and i let out a low-pitched , wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out .	1536.9172
she jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough .	315.30533
there had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out , and now i was certain i ' d seen her somewhere before .	741.00507
`` that ' s what started all the trouble in the first place .	29.16012
oh , dear , i ' m all unstrung ' ' .	685.6131
haven ' t we haven ' t i seen you .	385.68646
i mean , surely we ' ve ' ' --	15.391163
`` you may have seen me on tv ' ' , she said .	11.682221
`` i ' ve done several filmed commercials for ' ' --	56.71067
in fact , i was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell .	32693.29
man , you rang -- it was in color , too , miss , and miss ? ?	143.84724
what ' s your name , anyway ? ?	2.1329212
in a waterfall and all that ' ' .	3.1993692
`` that ' s the last one we did .	149.31665
it was fun for me , all right .	16.782738
i don ' t mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles ? ?	2266.5652
it wouldn ' t -- wouldn ' t seem fair , somehow ' ' .	181.33524
`` i couldn ' t agree with you more ' ' .	20.599836
`` i really do have something important to tell you , mr . scott .	160.31122
oh , yeah ' ' , i said .	10.409658
`` tell me about the murder ' ' .	3.3809104
zing was the creation of two men , louis thor and bill blake , partners in zing ! !	2847.3716
they ' d peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` sx-21 ' ' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign -- sales had soared practically into orbit .	903.05475
their product had been endorsed by good housekeeping , the a . m . a . , and the veterinary journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you didn ' t have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you didn ' t bathe .	249.14091
my lovely caller -- joyce holland was her name -- had previously done three filmed commercials for zing , and this evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of louis thor .	1257.13
the water in thor ' s big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds -- fashioned , of course , from zing -- joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath ' ' while cameras rolled .	1932.5867
the finished -- and drastically cut -- product would begin with a hazy longshot of joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool ' s surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and i had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap	2262.1748
joyce went on , `` when we ' d finished , lou -- mr . thor -- asked me to stay a little longer .	489.86502
he wanted a few stills for magazine ads , he said .	35.67261
everybody left and i stayed in the pool , then lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too .	769.295
and he didn ' t have any clothes on ' ' .	28.144367
`` did leap into the pool , and didn ' t have anything on .	72.16072
anyway , it was evident what he had in mind ' ' .	28.167118
`` you got away , didn ' t you ' ' ? ?	9.773705
he caught up with me once and grabbed me , but i was all covered with zing -- it ' s very slippery , you know ' ' .	219.13844
i wouldn ' t have the stuff in the house .	17.051224
but i ' m pleased to hear ' ' --	11.688754
`` so i just scooted out of his clutches .	23813.312
i swam like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car .	236.40582
the keys were still in it , and i was miles away before i remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where i ' d changed ' ' .	316.37445
she ' d driven around for a while , joyce said , then , thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that time , she ' d gone back to his home on bryn mawr drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool .	653.62604
while several yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she ' d seen two men on her left at the pool ' s edge .	171.64832
`` a man was holding onto lou , holding him up .	271.9445
maybe lou was only unconscious , but right then i thought he must be dead .	203.95418
the man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana .	1530.1832
there ' s a walk there that goes out to quebec drive .	3275.7627
i was so scared well , i just ran to my car and came here ' ' .	102.98079
`` you know who the other man was ' ' ? ?	21.461418
`` no , i never did see his face .	77.303276
i didn ' t get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and i was so scared it was just somebody in a man ' s suit .	99.275894
but i ' m sure the other one was lou ' ' .	256.27957
what joyce wanted me to do was go to thor ' s house and `` do whatever detectives do ' ' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification .	692.4183
she realized i ' d have to notify the police , but fervently hoped i could avoid mentioning her name .	1121.615
her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming tv series , underwater western eye , a documentary-type show to be sponsored by oatnut grits .	2890.251
but if joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor ' s wife , mrs . oatnut grits .	1602.7621
`` and i so want the part ' ' , she said .	12.346203
`` the commercials have just been for money , there hasn ' t been any real incentive for me to do them , but in underwater western eye i ' d have a chance to act .	196.77371
i could show what i can do ' ' .	2.3067477
as far as i was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do .	746.3943
but i promised joyce i would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort .	178.93433
seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles , and i smiled all the way into the bedroom .	654.7937
there i got my colt special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room .	469.9499
`` i ' m starting to itch ' ' , she said .	9.179545
`` yes , i ' m still all covered with that soap .	1229.8457
i was loaded with suds when i ran away , and i haven ' t had a chance to wash it off .	48.19377
`` you might as well wait here while i ' m gone , so you can use my shower if you ' d like ' ' .	64.5692
`` oh , i ' d love to ' ' .	9.822269
i showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` if you really don ' t mind , i think i ' ll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub .	113.67876
`` only when i do it ' ' .	2.997771
one of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color .	5702.2534
`` soak as long as you want , joyce .	14421.495
it ' ll probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with you .	183.27759
so you ' ll have everything all to yourself , doggone ' '	1708.2649
`` well , goodbye ' ' , i said .	19.330954
`` oh , you can count on that ' ' .	10.134862
i ' ll be soaking for at least half an hour ' ' .	41.734055
but suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them .	2981.9133
however , when there ' s a job to be done , i ' m a monstrosity of grim determination , i like to think .	214.39308
i spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .	87.79271
as i went out , i could hear water pouring in the shower .	1307.9124
she wouldn ' t be taking a cold shower .	586.2061
bryn mawr drive is only two or three miles from the spartan , and it took me less than five minutes to get there .	185.59555
but the scene was not the quiet , calm scene i ' d expected .	495.05197
four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars .	266.58746
lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds .	885.5654
i followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .	114.48908
two uniformed officers , a couple of plain-clothesmen i knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left .	339.87552
at the pool ' s far end was the little cabana joyce had mentioned , and on the water ' s surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather .	13654.935
a few yards beyond the group of men , a man ' s nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra .	920.4533
lieutenant rawlins , one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted me and said , `` hi , shell ' ' , and walked toward me .	259.9388
`` how ' d you hear about this one ' ' ? ?	15.077922
rawlins worked out of central homicide and we ' d been friends for years .	111.71644
a call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine p . m . , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now .	202.09381
present at the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed louis thor -- had been thor ' s partner bill blake , and antony rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account .	2186.5977
neither of them , i understood , had been present at the filming session earlier .	1416.1318
`` what were they doing here ' ' ? ?	7.377389
`` they were supposed to meet thor at nine pm for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this sx-21 stuff ' ' .	2256.8018
`` yeah , i ' ve heard more about sx-21 than space exploration lately .	18892.898
that was the new advertising angle -- something about a lloyd ' s of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient .	233.58578
actually , only two men know what the formula is , blake and ' ' -- he stopped and looked at thor ' s body .	267.21808
i said , `` o . k . , so now only blake knows .	1422.7892
how ' s it strike you , foul or fair ' ' ? ?	40.69047
deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on ' em .	1398.8502
the pm might show he drowned instead , but that ' s what the once-over-lightly gives us .	396.17758
accident , murder , suicide -- take your pick ' ' .	16.238007
`` according to rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out .	2377.647
too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living	82.90173
this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband ' s eyes while you are having an affair with his wife .	294.53592
if it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics i would have been stymied on what to do , and now i understand why they are classics	397.3252
those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick .	6337.509
i worked for my uncle ( an uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in new orleans ' vieux carre , the old french quarter .	721.55493
the arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day .	156.46251
the rest of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting .	1045.6061
i had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun .	935.49994
i had come to new orleans two years earlier after graduating college , partly because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there .	975.9659
when my uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted .	417.85992
i loved the city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras .	12807.797
i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide , joyous celebration with romance in the air	1151.8002
and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner .	966.5684
the very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .	668.4729
it was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes , cover their faces with masks and go adventuring .	1606.7441
my uncle and i were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .	331.10873
sometimes i wondered vaguely what he did about women for my aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything .	416.47443
one monday morning i saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt .	719.77625
they were married over the week-end , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty .	208.13159
it was really a may and december combination .	11.784605
my new aunt was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long time since i had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex .	410.15292
there was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like new orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me .	406.88214
her legs were the full , sexy kind , full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite	1800.6654
the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect .	85.47509
you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but i am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body .	268.5107
the true artist is like one of those scientists who , from a single bone can reconstruct an animal ' s entire body .	378.7498
the artist looks at an ankle , a calf , a bosom and , in his mind ' s eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is .	212.6256
and that is the way i first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store .	975.0769
i was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them .	7972.3384
i thought i saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks .	5643.485
true , she was my aunt , married to an uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , i did not know or much care .	173.451
she was standing with her back to the glass door .	549.5987
her form was silhouetted and with the strong light i could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired .	242.06604
as it is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something clicks .	405.61792
something clicked in this instance , but i treated her circumspectly and i felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance .	1033.6631
when she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my uncle notice it .	2239.8684
and then i became aware that she , too , glanced at me surreptitiously .	2123.3147
i felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and i a nude model .	259.32623
i dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship .	226.46646
when our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of `` me , too ' ' .	222.48465
it is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity .	344.62186
why she married him i do not know .	40.12787
i myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me .	353.7481
he already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living .	564.1125
perhaps , with my uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed	413.7914
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father	172.84558
for several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners , and then one day uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home	2259.7202
i was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my uncle ' s indisposition .	349.3377
even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .	1074.8379
the cavernous depth , cluttered with antiques , echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk .	387.11642
she placed her palms , fingers outspread , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` now , what next ' ' ? ?	125.87813
i was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune .	916.09216
there was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .	173.15236
i was standing beside her , watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped .	7435.113
i bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush .	2063.4692
her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender .	470.18567
i heard her murmur , `` we ' d better lock the door ' ' .	409.7092
it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch .	1090.9467
when we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said	475.26486
`` he will not always be indisposed ' ' .	1.8151693
how will we work it out ' ' ? ?	7.637278
`` i don ' t know ' ' , she said .	16.159344
i ' ve noticed the way you ' ve been looking at me ever since we met ' ' .	133.2844
`` i guess we both felt it ' ' .	2.7430503
`` i guess so ' ' , she said .	8.513639
even as i said it i realized that an education can be invaluable .	268.91443
`` i know what we can do ' ' , i said .	17.487593
`` tell him i made a pass at you ' ' .	11.654946
she raised a protesting hand with a startled air .	209.0918
`` what are you trying to do ? ?	1.0369087
if i even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew ' ' ? ?	270.8936
`` i don ' t want to be thrown out and i don ' t think i will .	61.239292
i think i have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us ' ' .	261.0504
`` by telling him you are making passes at me ' ' ? ?	36.606968
`` when i was in college ' ' , i grinned , `` i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class .	361.72714
i don ' t even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets .	756.4766
in those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell	2124.9697
and now i think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us .	436.31723
a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball .	453.13773
if you tell him i made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something i said or did , so instead of just telling him i made a pass , say i tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse i really am .	711.5867
we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near lake ponchartrain .	9648.877
and to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .	295.02396
he could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .	1423.8528
when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it ' ' .	73.36961
`` but you ' ' -- she began .	71.25615
it will turn out all right ' ' .	2.0265172
`` i don ' t understand ' ' , she insisted .	79.72087
`` are you trying to cut your throat ' ' ? ?	3.5982618
`` no ' ' , i chuckled , `` i ' m just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education ' ' .	78.18762
as we expected , on the following day my uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning .	342.20587
i felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife .	255.61504
i quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days .	174.8089
i heard subsequently that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date .	241.59557
shortly before nine i drove my jalopy to the street facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view .	838.69635
a few minutes later i saw my uncle ' s car drive up and a woman ' s figure emerge and walk to the corner .	250.22005
i must say the figure was well made up .	34.95047
if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him .	638.8323
in one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain .	177.31021
in the half darkness i approached cautiously , making sure he did not see me .	185.35854
he was looking out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without wasting words i smacked him hard across the face .	1262.45
`` you cheap , no good , two-timing bitch ! !	9570.493
you get a good , loyal husband -- smack ! !	22456.209
-- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew ! !	1523.3864
he had better write a postcard to walter .	16.672152
he opened the myth book again and there ( along the margin next to robert graves ' imaginative interpretation of the creation of the dactyls from rhea ' s fingertips ) were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilder ' s address .	1900.4468
the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer .	652.0008
the code , which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , nicolas was determined to find out and put to use .	460.1413
a card to walter would get him an introduction to this meredith , and that might be good for something .	266.16934
nicolas called on his muse , a line came back	1271.8317
`` squaresville , man , and all the palazzos are crummy palasts ' ' .	46243.77
that ought to draw a laugh , nicolas reasoned , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind .	608.1618
and indeed , his postcard did draw from walter a letter recommending his friend , the poet nicolas manas , to his friend meredith wilder .	3645.0283
five days later , on receiving it , meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table .	20038.12
his hand was large and square and heavily tanned .	42700.965
the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt .	169.56485
his four weeks in italy had turned into nearer three months .	568.181
he had returned to the pension a week ago .	32.610752
now , he was just in the late poems of holderlin and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next semester ' s class preparation .	667.76117
he was determined to spend an industrious summer .	5.516649
well , maybe manas wouldn ' t call .	9.134283
the menace of manas gradually faded as meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' how the dark fates laughed ' ? ?	1754.6448
or , more rhythmically , ' the swarthy witches are laughing ' ? ?	944.68225
and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas .	12994.24
but nicolas , too , was being interrupted , that morning .	357.91986
not by the 11 00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the english gardens and sent him off to sleep	345.3271
but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him .	660.68585
her heart , her maternal feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly thrilled by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from poussin .	1792.6852
she was just not able to break the spell .	1641.2893
( would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had found his first night in one of walter ' s marked bars ? ?	1507.5846
nicolas `` look , nicolas doesn ' t go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ?	357.223
so if all these beers was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money ' ' .	71.32182
ballet dancer protests , tears , and `` take what you want , nicolas , i am a dancer , you are a poet , it is all beautiful ' ' .	175.974
to this meek conjugation nicolas had replied , `` o . k . i can use this blanket .	179.89859
and when you get off this job tonight , well , you can gimme something to eat ' ' .	297.16904
and , as a matter of fact , nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that munich ' s early mornings even in summer are laden with dew .	1505.6521
he had always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms .	85.949974
he used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions .	391.163
) her nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn , black hair falling over his eyes .	2948.5762
she was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth .	263.24817
this was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised .	480.59778
that long night with nicolas and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes .	812.8416
his advice , his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair -- this was all new .	143.99274
her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith .	103.39238
mary jane might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined .	37.254726
even so , it took her several days to force walter to tell her nicolas ' s whereabouts .	3828.6042
packing a small suitcase , informing her husband whom she found in harry ' s bar that she was taking a train to germany to get away for a while , patting his arm , refusing a drink , getting on the train -- all this had only taken her two hours .	469.802
she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens .	90.56789
`` dear girl ' ' , walter had finally said , `` he writes me that he is sleeping in the english gardens ' ' .	127.54677
`` his address ' ' , walter added , `` is that great foundling home , the american express .	586.11536
and i will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband .	132.79756
' ' for the last half hour mary jane had criss-crossed half the length of the gardens and , at last , come upon her knight .	718.7566
his presence there , asleep in the grass , confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels , the meaning of nature , how to live , simply , with the angels .	482.1129
smiling , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched .	464.86276
the sun grew hotter as it approached the midday .	30283.648
nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car .	354.3096
in his dream he cried , `` slow down , for chrissake ' ' ! !	243.1152
he half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass .	412.44635
he blew his nose expertly between his fingers .	9.66384
he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs .	287.46658
mary jane got up , quietly , and walked away .	191.41724
twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the grafin ' s pension , her tears dried , signing a hotel form and asking for a bath .	875.83435
mary jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities .	970.0415
the grafin , who was charmed by her , told her , `` your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair .	518.97107
but a young american has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it this once .	210.28123
' ' ( the grafin was partial to the word shall .	176.91791
meredith was irritated when the grafin knocked at his door and told him , `` she is a great beauty ! !	88.13972
shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ?	276.14905
actually , she is a sad beauty , i believe .	140.40465
you shall see her at dinner ' ' .	1.9146848
rather erotically he listened to the bath water running	20928.873
when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way .	180.46927
before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day .	69.4318
a thing he did not like doing , generally .	3259.017
singing into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his italian sun tan .	200.00935
he flexed his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed .	864.2493
in the small gallery used as the guests ' dining room , meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began teasing the young waitress .	2660.4917
he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table .	1312.9469
it would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he , oh , dropped his napkin , so startled was he by mary jane ' s beauty .	1075.7065
yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the grafin as acknowledgement that here , indeed , was something special .	2101.5686
above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with , as he soon perceived , no brassiere beneath .	13970.21
her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders .	666.2345
perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day .	638.86334
she had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual .	3924.0347
as she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` thank you for the use of your bath ' ' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control .	407.71042
veal cutlets `` oh , i couldn ' t possibly eat all this ' ' ! !	116.725975
wine `` then you were typing poems this afternoon ' ' ? ?	52.346195
fruit compote `` if you think i would understand it ' '	25.833916
like as if it were built of books ' ' .	7.8461623
having opened the windows onto the terrace , lit the fire , translated the motto , meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin .	2605.414
opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it .	17125.82
`` i think the maids tipple in the afternoon ' ' .	20.892418
steinhager ' ' she whispered steinhager to herself , several times , memorizing it .	526.48206
`` would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself ' ' ? ?	42.778545
meredith ' s voice was always deep , with rough bass notes in it	1404.4254
in reading , on platforms , even in the large auditorium of the y . m . h . a . , poetry center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy .	349.85596
his new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed .	253.34721
the husband points the steps out with his flashlight `` its white stare filling her pale eyes to the blind brim with appetite , bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak all night , ' ' ( mary jane asked herself if meredith was blushing at this line , or was it the fire ? ?	3160.8662
in the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on `` in dull domestic radiance i watch her staring face , still blind , start wincing in obedience to dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , waiting below stairs , in her mind ' ' .	2253.6426
mary jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words .	346.43457
`` oh , it ' s that myth , about orpheus and what is her name ? ?	253.72925
she raised her face and nodded , `` it ' s sweet , and very sad ' ' .	50.870064
they discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds .	58.635822
she confessed she was unhappy , he asked was it her husband ? ?	99.51686
she began to explain , `` there was this poet , in italy ' ' he interrupted , `` please don ' t judge all poets ' ' .	201.16899
at her door , two or three hours later , mary jane whispered , `` everyone is asleep ' ' .	258.39246
kissing her he whispered , several times , `` eurydice ' ' .	238.49673
but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment , she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited , expectant , and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth .	451.81815
they were west of the sabine , but only god knew where .	2003.9915
for three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea .	3141.0845
suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping	26898.512
dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs .	194.65399
and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze .	3326.371
ben prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen .	1836.556
he commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .	836.36127
he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face .	5440.044
he moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs .	1853.1497
he cleared his throat and wet his lips .	5.1643953
as cheerfully as possible , he said , `` well , i guess we could all do with a little drink ' ' .	57.60261
he unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel .	221.02838
they could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation .	6931.034
the water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste .	5215.5044
thank the lord , they still had water ! !	24.197906
he cleansed his mouth with a small quantity .	8.247664
he took a long but carefully controlled draught .	35.558792
he replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck .	2344.6736
she took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his .	6963.691
she drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face .	1378.2279
she set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully .	388.2633
`` what happens when there ' s no more water ' ' ? ?	22.199585
she was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , opaque , explosive .	708.4925
her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal .	150.37334
her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up .	742.0435
and all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not visibly .	639.0367
a ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice .	314.29105
`` there must be some water under there ' ' .	13.730581
he tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .	57.60753
`` we can get it if we dig ' ' , he said patiently .	36.66073
`` and add fever to our troubles ' ' ? ?	5.242727
`` or do you want to see if i can stand fever , too ' ' ? ?	95.778244
`` we can boil it ' ' , he said .	8.530081
`` we ' re lost and burning up already ' ' , she bit out tensely .	1038.8547
`` the tires are rattling on the wheels now .	191.48589
they ' ll roll off in another day .	9.607867
there was no valley like this on your map .	596.5402
you don ' t even know where we ' re headed ' ' .	65.62509
`` hettie ' ' , he said as gently as he could , `` we ' re still headed west .	316.0565
somewhere , we ' ll hit a trail ' ' .	3.7908869
`` maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves ' ' .	471.69446
in a way , he couldn ' t blame her .	199.3752
he had picked out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon .	290.96738
it had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out .	49.47137
it wasn ' t the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her .	279.73587
she had hated the whole idea before they started .	560.63763
actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him .	90.455414
it had been five days too late before he learned that she ' d gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother .	383.71484
the bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound .	248.67307
she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder .	1463.5685
he had left her inviolate , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time .	956.2099
but each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper .	218.63484
he stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , calloused hands .	922.27747
`` i suppose ' ' , he muttered , `` i can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement ' ' .	167.85542
`` don ' t try to be noble ' ' ! !	11.076524
`` they wouldn ' t have sold me in the first place if there ' d been food enough to go around ' ' .	68.34584
`` hettie , they didn ' t sell you ' ' , he said miserably .	130.38318
`` they knew i was a good sharecrop farmer back in carolina , but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our own .	223.25162
they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what ' s inside of them .	237.23209
without money or property , what would you have had at baton rouge ' ' ? ?	67.15447
`` i might have starved , but at least i wouldn ' t be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt ' ' ! !	191.79056
his blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead .	7430.2144
to his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze .	3175.814
the valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead .	1854.2855
then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills .	2287.131
he had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in carolina .	583.8681
he hollered hoarsely , `` hang on ' ' ! !	6.956068
he wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm .	312.15213
too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge .	1047.8177
`` you had better get inside ' ' , he warned her .	118.027245
the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel .	5059.4526
frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones .	19309.932
the six-ton conestoga began to whip and shake .	8.603345
it was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence .	398.77835
the heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts .	877.5253
and then came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket .	4917.479
walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods .	22487.41
through the splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks .	1615.2334
the jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff .	508.61014
the dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising .	243.2117
they cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom .	1236.1962
they were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river .	611.1149
then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight .	259.98962
beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills .	1049.5284
the water level was higher than their hubs .	3.5574434
only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .	2131.5642
there was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere .	7084.6274
now and then , the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past .	4592.687
the girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling .	1105.4471
her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for ben .	8951.164
out of compulsion to say something cheery , ben prime blurted , `` well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit .	1170.1482
the soaking will put life back in the wagon , too ' ' .	73.12254
his wife didn ' t give a sign she ' d heard .	203.91528
she was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current .	34632.707
it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch .	2901.9475
but as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell .	1534.8228
they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend .	82.110374
it speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly .	5530.3096
`` there ' s the one who ' s lucky ' ' ! !	28.11521
ben ' s eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson .	2797.2507
then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts , needing their comfort more than they needed his .	601.8198
it was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half-swimming his way , for he was not a tall man .	330.3332
he let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water .	417.8382
he sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward .	2951.7637
of all their worldly belongings , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most treasured .	650.3873
it was spoiled now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it .	494.59164
he examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished .	328.2148
the waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels	1083.4989
there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding .	378.04486
he doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley .	2860.2693
a terrible , numbing sense of futility swept over him .	21.050205
he gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat .	2219.4998
then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen .	990.25836
the spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece .	2115.3928
he swung toward the front to give the news to hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate .	1305.6405
he got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee .	271.91586
he poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort .	14497.476
he found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save .	184.97789
now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie .	38524.973
his long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time .	1670.5146
he furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open .	5569.4443
he looked thoughtfully at his wife ' s trunk , holding her meager treasures .	7213.8877
he said hesitantly , `` hettie , i don ' t figure your things got wet too much .	243.91992
if you want to get them aired ' '	1.2872189
she said without turning her head , `` after that rain beating in atop the dust , there isn ' t a thing that won ' t be streaked ' ' .	355.30286
he drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs .	4797.9067
sulphur , oil , and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of .	14163.776
i suppose a lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze .	402.4861
now , roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep , not knowing what to do .	1340.704
i heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man ' s bare back .	2239.0398
he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters .	702.1324
one especially bad detonation shook lifeboat no . 3 which trembled violently in the davits .	11991.49
brassnose yelled `` come on , sommers , max step on it , we got a chance now .	291.82648
we pulled and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they bled profusely .	9517.711
the bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare .	4244.257
her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water .	1706.6748
brassnose , max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the boat .	152.87741
`` let ' s get away fast ' ' , said brassnose , shaking water from his mop of bleached hair .	1555.7385
`` that tub is going to explode all at once ' ' .	10.601624
then the bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam , geysers of sparks and flames , and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke .	2911.1047
dimly , we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn ' t go back into that inferno .	550.17633
already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water .	77.93361
`` sommers , you bale while we row ' ' , brassnose commanded .	2109.8442
as best as i could determine , we were some 700 miles west of new guinea , in the bismark archipelago .	3984.4722
three days previously , we had steamed past barren rennell island in the distance .	33309.12
now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the pacific , for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon .	696.82916
there were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands	283.74677
the big man with the whitened hair murmured something his words sounded as if they were in the manu tongue , which i recognized , having studied the dialect in my anthropology 6 , class at the university of chicago .	436.97623
he then said something which struck a chord in my memory .	66.39264
`` god help us if we ' re near the island of eromonga .	3852.525
we ' d be in real trouble then .	18.74662
i ' d rather keep bailing -- or sink ' ' .	75.39548
i was puzzled by the remark , then i recalled the voice of mild professor howard griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies .	2090.613
`` even when the islands were under german mandate before world war 1 , , europeans gave eromonga a wide berth .	4290.218
the place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the twentieth century -- stone age amazons who live in an all-female , matriarchal society which is self-sufficient ' ' .	1706.7855
i remembered , too , the jesting voice of a classmate , bobby pauson `` but how do they reproduce , dr . griggs ? ?	2141.53
i ' m sure that males have something to do with that process ' ' ! !	115.317894
there had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as professor griggs said dryly `` i see your point , pauson .	7678.565
of course , males play a role there , but believe me when i say you wouldn ' t enjoy yourself one bit on eromonga .	684.78094
indeed , you wouldn ' t live long , for the females either drive the men they ' ve seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes , or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods .	2588.701
in fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men ' ' .	135.29922
`` i think i know what you mean , brassnose ' ' , i said .	171.5939
let ' s hope we come to a safer place ' ' .	61.31178
three hours later , while we were bailing desperately , a dot of land came into view .	650.0296
foster lukuklu frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs i recognized it as an ancient manu gesture intended to propitiate the devil .	5672.5415
in a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big bo ' sun ' s mate quavered	3014.314
it is eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff ' ' .	342.29874
there was a wooden tower or derrick there , something like a ski jump	911.2236
it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs .	1866.3754
a fine example of engineering in a primitive society .	55.947304
`` what is the scaffolding for , brassnose ' ' ? ?	5.655875
he made a sound of despair deep in his throat .	216.36935
it was embarrassing to see strapping , blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen .	19869.729
it is their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death .	691.99347
it is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there .	1126.4597
often , i heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when i was a small boy growing up in rabaul .	540.68616
they had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers ' ' .	70.38161
our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had heard of the inhabitants of eromonga , i was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft .	1345.0306
i expected brassnose -- as a man with a strain of melanesian in his blood -- to speak to them .	357.59778
but he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked .	21838.93
so , i mustered my few words of the manu dialect and said , `` we greet you in peace .	1298.5209
my friends and i come from a ship which was destroyed by fire .	138.78206
our sore and burned hands and arms need attention ' ' .	30.189201
the girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me .	370.44934
i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair .	3678.3667
she said , `` my name is songau and these girls are ponkob and piwen .	3006.0117
you shall have food , water and rest ' ' .	6.9329696
thirty minutes later , the outrigger grated on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder .	681.90735
i saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there .	23333.088
all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight .	912.2497
there was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick .	1844.693
others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them .	4119.6226
there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me .	37.432186
this was also a corpse -- a male , judging from the coral arm bands , the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face , the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose .	5745.114
the body may have been two or three weeks ' dead .	552.317
many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh .	52.22555
the man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul .	10217.315
as if divining my thoughts , the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden	4878.815
`` this is our tultul , a jumping platform , aku .	11000.474
our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago .	6314.5107
it took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one .	929.58234
we are very proud of it ' ' .	2.4385803
`` you have every right to be ' ' , i replied gravely in the manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us .	1082.9116
he looked as if he was going to keel over .	1702.5725
i felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn ' t do to show these girls that we were afraid .	111.08411
i clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women `` this one is the maku frayne .	779.5778
he speaks your language too , for he is the grandson of a chieftain on taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning .	1201.6554
the maku frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather ' ' .	30.539032
this was the worst thing i could have said .	90.008804
brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly , `` sommers , you meddling yank , you ' re a fool ! !	2262.3423
they destroy such men with their damned tests .	3.4852462
you ' ve ruined me , blast you ' ' ! !	4.6916714
at first , i thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this .	231.69806
but a glance at songau and the other women confirmed what brassnose had blurted out .	43635.33
the women ' s faces had hardened after my statement .	226.10242
at a nod from songau , four lithe and muscular girls darted to frayne ' s side and seized him by the arms .	1536.0507
the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle	3276.6157
but four eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived .	849.9328
besides , terror had sapped some of frayne ' s vitality and will .	116.13736
my last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face	891.84216
in the manu tongue , `` eromonga ' ' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed .	12614.439
in the hut to which i was assigned -- max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases .	5307.8667
her name was l ' turu and she told me many things .	149.8922
for an anthropologist , loquacious old l ' turu was a mine of information .	1468.0355
though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never leave it alive , i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women .	468.17487
( her account was later confirmed by the scobee-frazier expedition from the university of manitoba in 1951 .	3736.5957
from l ' turu , i heard that until about 1850 the people of this island -- which was about the size of guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes , and that the normal family life of melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations .	599.90735
but in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` karipo ' ' seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled .	2538.9373
miraculously , karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoes , after considerable loss of life on both sides .	1752.6981
karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist .	98.18398
she quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied , by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death .	904.3031
within a decade or less , few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up .	708.153
`` karipo was great goddess , told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children ' ' , the crone told me .	634.508
she cackled with mirth , showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth .	5424.74
`` karipo ' s women then named this place ' eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here .	3429.0989
the old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood .	833.5246
in the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground .	1198.8711
`` i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home .	604.02783
maybe to beat up on his squaw ' ' .	2.6150908
benson looked up and saw ramey ' s long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib .	2245.4236
ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack .	7770.5596
`` i ' d like to know just which it is that those guys don ' t understand , the liquor or automobiles ' ' .	142.55226
somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver .	345.79868
for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened .	16495.174
maybe the indian wasn ' t too much at fault , ramey thought .	5505.43
maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us .	84.60441
anyway , he doesn ' t deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at .	354.0274
`` ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , benny ' ' ? ?	529.6358
benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .	437.09647
`` nope , just you , all the time -- sometimes i think it ' s the only way i ' ll ever get a decent partner ' ' .	88.812546
ramey smiled but he thought to himself , i always see me too .	411.80356
whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind .	455.29343
then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .	363.78415
with this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .	100.223885
`` you seen him yet ' ' ? ?	1.0676713
`` he wasn ' t in the car ' ' , ramey said .	335.3037
`` you didn ' t go clear around ' ' , benson said .	170.93332
`` if you want to see something , he ' s back on the other side by the trunk of the car ' ' .	74.92819
`` too long a waiting line ' ' , ramey answered , pretending to joke .	6594.1216
a few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .	3148.486
it was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .	1205.8837
sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .	208.4849
all the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane .	6523.304
horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .	202.89088
it had always seemed strange to ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .	2058.1992
the insurance man informed them that he had talked to crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men ' s personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .	753.6676
he chatted with ramey and benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .	396.67755
every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .	1206.3909
when they were ready to leave , benson and ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .	1145.7423
`` there ' s a body you won ' t mind looking at ' ' , benson said and they stopped .	287.83994
she had driven up with her husband in a convertible with eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that .	690.51056
she wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .	4.1473913
slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .	193.59216
`` what outfit does she drive for ' ' ? ?	3.0918968
seeing her caused a lurch in ramey , a recognition .	376.3924
she might have been someone he had once loved .	702.24457
he had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .	168.58087
the truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .	3912.5813
how would you ever see her again ? ?	1.038091
the feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning .	1934.0173
`` what ' s she doing in this bunch ' ' ? ?	62.157505
benson said , and ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .	325.3131
her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .	880.4055
it made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .	375.34354
she began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly .	611.7386
what had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but benson knew what it was .	341.49466
the girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when benson , in that barefoot courtliness ramey could never decide was real , said , `` you don ' t want to go around there , ma ' am ' ' .	759.06885
the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .	373.9829
the man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car .	314.7833
`` what does he want , a spoon ' ' ? ?	17.485472
one tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain .	736.8418
with ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the indian ' s foot that he would always remember .	1075.6547
the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top .	644.03766
the slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .	407.40646
the two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .	2210.83
he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .	577.6922
he turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .	559.23224
he was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a coca-cola poster .	3405.2114
`` he ' s dead , isn ' t he ' ' ? ?	15.487429
he turned and bent over the body of the indian .	44.834366
there was nothing in particular on the man ' s face .	27.881378
it was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .	583.0407
the man said , backing up a step , still looking down .	211.42764
there was a gentle concern in benson ' s voice .	11.059075
ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man ' s tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .	3624.0615
`` but what is it ' ' ? ?	1.0512314
the man said with a tone of impatience .	6.7015867
ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .	674.84656
the sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and ramey ' s vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man ' s leg .	974.31335
ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .	163.23875
he stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` don ' t do that , fella .	486.47162
the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .	651.39514
ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .	32.564327
he laid all four knuckles in between the man ' s cheekbone and his chin .	758.175
ramey ' s fist and the air expelled from the man ' s collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .	3714.0676
the man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .	1801.0991
ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .	237.07896
as he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .	232.84525
he hadn ' t done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .	284.9281
with a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .	135.44066
his arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .	109.85586
after what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .	6707.9746
the man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth .	1205.1357
even yet there was no realization in his eyes .	162.02419
ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .	739.01135
a woman ' s voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man ' s wife .	163.4203
one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .	791.2644
blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright v woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .	1125.3037
the girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .	146.21481
`` can you hear , can you talk to me ' ' ? ?	5.8362594
an incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .	406.0452
the girl looked around quickly at several of the people .	17.652279
none of the crowd had stepped forward to help .	80.636566
`` why did you do it -- why did you hit him ' ' ? ?	38.74405
a shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .	73.224106
behind ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .	2.4750328
no one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .	1257.8394
ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .	977.35974
benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .	3012.8193
ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .	5.511906
some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at ramey .	2194.0425
it ' s all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .	780.70905
ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .	872.2072
he saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman ' s swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .	1459.8529
`` all right , step back ' ' ! !	14.415579
the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .	395.0514
he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .	75.72681
`` mough -- it ' s my mough ' ' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .	76.418335
his brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .	576.8703
then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head -- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute .	438.3831
the body continued to lash , but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow .	3435.688
he slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .	322.1394
he heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .	2457.7688
it was only then that he turned to look at penny .	625.2883
she was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .	226.16624
the fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .	288.57382
she ' s got guts , thought keith .	23.644112
she ' s got more guts than any other woman in the world .	85.05505
`` keith ' ' , said penny , `` keith , you were wonderful .	1167.5525
i don ' t suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but i am .	106.9656
and for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .	978.45886
he knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part .	1530.4218
`` i realize that this is hardly the time to say it , penny ' ' , said keith .	214.99536
`` but knowing you , i know that you ' re glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because i killed the snake , even though i had to .	148.11934
`` yes ' ' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .	482.68152
`` the snake was beautiful , wasn ' t it ' ' ? ?	8.877023
asked keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .	557.57306
`` it was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn ' t it ? ?	161.21747
now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .	254.60974
`` we ' re all god ' s creatures , aren ' t we ' ' ? ?	57.676105
`` all of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .	1336.768
you love this village and these stinking brown people because they ' re god ' s creatures , too .	190.33641
and you love ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he ' s a beautiful man .	81.59641
and he loves you because you ' re a beautiful woman .	453.94678
we ' re all god ' s creatures , aren ' t we , penny ? ?	155.08945
all of us , that is , except me .	422.96817
you hate me , you hate my guts , because i like to hunt .	208.67665
you actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because i killed that filthy snake .	1082.5513
well , why don ' t you say something ' ' ? ?	12.254115
`` there isn ' t anything left to say , is there , keith ' ' ? ?	207.97931
she softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because keith was between her and the invader .	923.12177
he knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him .	402.14713
just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .	340.27054
the brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .	449.4519
for a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of gurla mandhata and kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of assam , past the khasi hills , and into bengal , past sirinjani and madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the bay of bengal .	2881.896
keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .	553.03754
he thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords .	766.89343
at first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war .	237.72433
but `` after the war ' ' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .	243.48357
wing commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .	140.70523
and keith ' s record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .	156.9848
he became a fighter pilot after the stint over the hump in the big crates .	6501.9946
the raf was britain ' s weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .	203.48947
and he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear .	278.10303
that was true , but only half the truth .	418.0909
the other half he didn ' t like to recognize , even to himself .	265.95642
not defending england , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .	248.3974
and he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a nazi .	87.34829
nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .	277.68033
the nazis bombed britain , so the raf retaliated and shot them all down .	4108.8604
it was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the british on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .	2031.3804
it took a long time before the british tipped the balance .	15415.552
keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked .	1090.9227
they grounded him ( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the command offices .	517.979
he was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking american wac , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the command offices , but that was all .	1022.8132
penny knew him better , on her part .	10.998818
he had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .	607.8188
they don ' t go for bull-like muscle , as a rule .	22.522179
he had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .	1307.802
he was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .	1881.3024
his hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man .	356.4736
the pretty little twittering wacs said he had the look of eagles -- and penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied .	731.5362
but they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .	471.07996
the command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy .	499.82294
the nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .	613.923
but there hadn ' t been enough time to build it for keeps .	381.65085
there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .	1256.9922
this one was actually more of a `` near miss ' ' .	69.20572
the bomb plunged into the ground near the post , but not precisely into the command room itself .	595.9361
there was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .	727.09625
that is , everyone but keith and penny .	30.700853
they stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast .	505.36176
keith was on his feet because he didn ' t care at all about life any more penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .	319.0835
the blast damaged , but did not destroy the room .	28.3924
keith ' s eyes met penny ' s as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .	714.871
and , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to penny and took her hand in his .	578.8519
the chaplain married them , on the next day .	7.283863
after the war , penny had wanted keith at least to visit her home with her .	124.28917
she came from ohio , from what she called a `` small farm ' ' of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers .	523.7021
it wasn ' t that , however , which decided them not to go to america .	194.14813
keith told penny about his dream to return to india and burma .	90.355576
he stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles .	201.92361
he didn ' t tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .	1798.7054
that was his true love , not penny .	30.650045
the terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .	505.52084
and in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .	114.19934
when they got to shillong , in assam , he was happy .	92.2999
this was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .	5926.511
the sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the scottish elk .	770.6758
he even hunted elephant , although the asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his african cousin .	3105.7126
but there are big rogues in both countries .	9.6269865
these were the ones keith sought out -- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .	314.97083
he and penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah .	9428.013
and while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , penny marvelled at the eden they were traversing .	3133.3833
they came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .	5.3202934
there were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song .	5301.2246
mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .	2933.9548
wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they didn ' t consider such game worthy of a shot from the .	727.5402
now , the next morning , they were anchored at the elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it	2177.0908
and robinson roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .	357.29932
he and his safety man , herr schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together .	1684.7892
the german courteously indicated that robinson should mount first .	343.12137
robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly .	933.39954
he took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .	259.9076
`` temper , temper ' ' , mrs . forsythe said , laughing uneasily .	1860.738
a phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten a . m .	481.41202
`` i loused it ' ' , rob said , with a savage note in his voice .	176.12494
`` all i have to do to set the record is to go on down .	179.55168
`` was it my equipment ' ' ? ?	1.0743024
`` was it something went bad with the breathing ' ' ? ?	33.802475
`` the equipment was fine ' ' , rob stated , standing up .	1568.0967
he was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation .	2005.478
i ' ve been that far half a dozen times .	52.956623
i don ' t get it why this time i should pull such a stupid trick ' ' .	123.452034
`` well , i get it ' ' , artie said , still on the ladder .	788.9925
`` you are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .	360.69507
and you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .	3648.8262
`` no , it wasn ' t that ' ' , rob said .	72.67531
a note of awe came into his voice .	11.060221
`` when i came up , damnit , i thought i was going down .	99.430954
i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening ' ' .	31.756365
`` pressure-happy ' ' , artie said , and climbed in .	1086.7106
`` that ' s right ' ' , robinson said .	143.98222
but when it happens to you like that , i tell you , and you ' re a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think .	150.41472
you don ' t head back down again .	11.941359
he had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .	269.5124
waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .	3533.7588
now he was going to show how much he knew .	170.11555
`` our boy didn ' t chicken out , no sir .	695.3544
he ran into the rapture of the depths .	7.139258
it makes the diver feel drunk ' ' .	2.159656
`` well , that ' s the only way to be ' ' , mrs . forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .	265.8365
`` maybe not , if you ' re 200 feet under water ' ' , artie said .	1221.6677
`` anyway ' ' , waddell went on .	796.88837
`` it ' s nothing to fool with .	141.65977
personally , i don ' t blame him for giving up the dive , much as i regret losing the story ' ' .	334.82315
`` nobody ' s giving anything up ' ' , robinson said .	21.200527
he stood there , towering over them all gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group	608.93134
`` you think i got you and artie and herr schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? ?	1278.5787
`` that ' s my boy ' ' ! !	13.420497
`` rob ' s not going to give up as easy as all that ' ' .	103.118034
he was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .	13711.975
he went to key west every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` commodore ' ' was never used without irony .	272.19644
old commodore forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .	1218.6603
now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .	413.65668
`` why ' ' , he went on , `` when rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , i didn ' t think twice about it .	162.35489
i ' ve helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother ' s tackle shop .	434.3154
hell , i gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , rob ' ' ? ?	173.94814
`` seven years ago , commodore ' ' , rob said impassively .	6740.7124
he was thinking , big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when i started .	523.17444
`` excuse me ' ' , he said abruptly .	7546.698
he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters	451.16605
went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .	179.23175
`` when you gotta go , you gotta go ' ' , mrs . forsythe said .	85.912155
waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .	172.97849
he was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the german , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .	221.30132
`` hi there , schaffner ' ' , he had said .	33.12243
`` can i make you one ' ' ? ?	4.919859
`` no thank you very much ' ' , schaffner had answered in his accented english .	3461.8916
`` i do not drink so much , thank you ' ' .	29.95196
waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .	245.73563
he was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to american ways .	926.02313
his open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .	485.30463
waddell had heard that he had been a commando in rommel ' s afrika corps , and he said to himself i ' d hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .	627.516
`` rob tells me he ' s using your atlantis equipment on the dive ' ' .	593.6198
`` yes ' ' , herr schaffner had said .	31.373741
`` he ' s one hell of a decent boy .	249.531
`` and if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right ' ' ? ?	209.09929
`` well , no ' ' , herr schaffner said .	14788.941
`` but that ' s what he told me .	11.242278
why , that ' s his main reason for making the dive ' ' .	100.57318
shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .	368.60242
`` what do you mean ' ' ? ?	1.0143846
`` please let me explain ' ' , the german said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .	1501.0807
`` i have in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .	55.64546
now i wish to enter the american market , where the competition is very strong .	86.7454
i must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .	387.20023
with all respect to a fine young man , mr . roy is not able to provide these necessaries ' ' .	199.3828
waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .	49.74552
`` did you tell him all this ' ' ? ?	3.016697
`` perhaps not in so many words ' ' , the german said .	103.36329
`` but surely you have misunderstood mr . roy .	722.3412
never , never did i offer him the exclusive rights .	377.5023
we spoke of the need for advertising , and i agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .	810.6272
but there was no definite agreement about business arrangements ' ' .	100.10787
`` well , damn ' ' , waddell said .	9.910954
there was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .	1343.1688
`` you intend to speak with mr . roy ' ' ? ?	69.33953
`` if you will pardon , i think it would be better if not .	77.57527
mr . roy is determined to make this dive .	1413.9066
i know this from my talks with him ' ' .	3.6373062
`` well , let ' s let him make up his own mind , ok ' ' ? ?	119.624535
`` on the basis of the facts ' ' .	1.8106519
`` you will make him unhappy and anxious ' ' , the german said .	96.47036
`` at 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .	96.44032
it is not good , mr . waddell you will do him great harm ' ' .	145.4341
there was no doubt that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said .	260.09528
waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .	71.12424
`` i am an honest man ' ' , the german said with fervor .	674.056
`` i will give mr . roy his due for this dive .	1247.7831
i will make him distributor for all of florida -- a big market .	502.1856
this will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .	698.037
but there is no use causing him to worry at this time ' ' .	43.025764
the german ' s words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .	4281.9653
he took a big swig of his drink .	10.776743
it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .	192.86382
`` i think maybe you ' re right , schaffner ' ' , he said .	153.44363
`` he has the distributorship for florida , you say ' ' ? ?	20.584774
`` yes ' ' , the german said .	14440.198
`` at least for south florida ' ' .	2.3193612
`` by god ' ' , waddell said , `` we don ' t want to upset the boy at this time of all times .	65.40638
he sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .	1571.5107
the story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown	3075.792
the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business america .	1446.4181
`` join me in another ' ' ? ?	1.0812753
`` thank you ' ' , the german had said courteously .	8495.15
`` i do not drink so much ' ' .	1.4630148
now , in that same cabin , robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .	547.773
fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .	5.8750443
he pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .	3808.2805
`` blessed saint nicholas , i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when i was bewildered .	838.4173
and when i make the dive again ' ' -- he paused	113.35868
said a hail mary , slowly and with understanding .	1488.538
folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to headquarters .	322.54147
`` holy mary , mother of god , star of the sea , stay thou with me on this next dive .	1754.1161
let me set the record this time , and let me get back ok , so the german will give me the exclusive .	585.4595
and make my life different and better from this time on .	116.6132
as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .	361.1112
artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .	5726.7124
he waited awhile before he said , `` roy , you know your decompression table , don ' t you ' ' ? ?	268.68103
`` you know i know it ' ' , robinson answered warily .	20575.027
`` you came straight up from 275 without a stop ' ' , artie said .	479.39203
`` well , i was a little bit confused .	203.84967
anyway , i wasn ' t down long enough to matter .	119.40074
you don ' t see me stretched out on the deck , do you ' ' ? ?	33.01516
`` you know what they say about two deep dives in one day ' ' , artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .	4798.987
`` i don ' t think you should go down again ' ' .	18.537506
the enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .	1129.8461
as his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .	121.89961
he crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .	7133.1353
in the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .	1714.8519
for a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .	861.3333
he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .	3946.8196
his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .	152.15634
his remembering the self-dictate brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt .	243.72577
he murmured to himself , with firmness `` no surrender ' ' .	39.282486
it was best to die fighting the marines .	14.600828
his superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .	168.61995
then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .	173.0025
whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .	1346.7725
he sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .	3691.4397
his fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .	1172.1044
the knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .	2001.1134
besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .	12.887123
as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .	1982.3875
the marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .	2797.7588
his fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .	284.0851
`` come out , come out in the meadow ' ' , matsuo said under his breath .	1332.0522
the man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .	188.3365
matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .	9294.618
fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .	498.2412
they had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .	3937.1394
a wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .	944.0892
when he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .	1613.5437
matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun .	1232.1144
the callous marines had laughed at each other ' s retching , while stacking bodies .	2225.9353
at nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .	1912.6797
apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .	3123.8325
he decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .	327.14044
only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .	2411.066
because he couldn ' t hear them , he was more convinced they were there .	105.22283
a spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground	647.9488
leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .	2398.473
while his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .	745.65295
taking aim at the man ' s face , matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .	632.23834
he wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .	307.21524
the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .	8.557804
like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle .	3147.4866
before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .	5844.52
matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .	1468.4535
five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .	559.28394
he went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .	704.97894
but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .	210.41525
he wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .	753.24365
with a sudden decisiveness he lurched in matsuo ' s direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .	1104.9286
when he got closer to the tree , matsuo noted the wild look on his face .	2209.8203
the bobbing head was a poor target , so matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .	5911.9697
the marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward .	615.7779
in the hush that followed the echoes , matsuo was tense .	29814.996
they could come on him now without difficulty .	28.776176
the marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .	740.7062
down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .	191.29543
the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .	506.6483
matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .	6.9068737
rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .	400.0525
heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .	9840.938
he squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .	67.05553
with a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .	481.90213
the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone	27610.625
around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch .	472.8998
maintaining his clutch on the hair , matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .	8382.002
in one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man ' s bleeding .	1052.2063
in the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .	5758.3447
one by one he tossed the objects aside .	16.780754
he didn ' t smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter	7605.3438
he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .	312.79047
then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .	1585.9108
from its holder he took his own canteen .	3.4788742
the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .	10458.556
the marine ' s eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .	12738.546
matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .	4.480529
the marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .	26.91995
not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .	790.37555
`` you came well equipped to die ' ' .	1.6004841
some odor made him lean over the man .	9.185366
drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .	302.46774
the marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .	222.87094
when he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .	4675.5
awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .	260.51904
the smell of sake had freshened yesterday ' s events in his thoughts .	151.30312
in the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .	1338.5692
`` are you a thrower of flame , marine ' ' ? ?	87.13625
matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine ' s reach and away from their shadows .	133.92574
he waited in his squat , gripping the hair .	100.14325
its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .	7.5031357
the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .	752.7115
wet also were the marine ' s fatigues and the face had an oily film .	462.67346
the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .	20.787842
now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .	1556.2639
he must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze .	735.4987
even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine ' s handkerchief to wrap it .	2077.538
first he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .	747.55255
the marine yelled and flung the hand away .	9.206916
with a firm grip on the man ' s hair matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .	8114.8926
a shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled matsuo ' s wrist .	27535.209
burned each hand when they came groping again .	9.905299
the marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .	210.59813
`` a small measure of payment , marine ' ' .	32.686287
he dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .	1302.5419
the marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .	2893.1035
matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .	81.06624
as matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow .	2850.7285
in the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .	903.2012
it was the marine head lifted , he strained and called .	5747.6733
then he astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .	265.17044
once and for all he ' d finish this marine who would not die .	838.2973
it sounded as if the man were calling him `` hey , japanese hey there , japanese ' ' .	1519.5768
the man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .	1224.891
he performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .	1641.683
the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .	820.56213
remembering his own thirst , matsuo took out his water bottle .	1305.209
he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .	6840.453
his years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .	611.54816
he began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .	16225.784
popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .	169.81389
down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .	413.2007
the marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .	367.81512
and when this was gone , he hadn ' t even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .	1774.7152
after all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .	229.56085
the upper part of his packet had stained dark .	1412.0665
there is nothing for you ' ' , matsuo said .	16567.094
`` your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .	2983.8137
from the convulsive quivers of the man ' s shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .	438.51416
he reminded matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china .	527.7267
in china it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .	2870.7742
chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .	1797.7776
only blue throat and his gang stayed where they were .	72.49073
blue throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .	1038.0808
he leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .	116.70298
`` since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys ' ' ? ?	158.74821
`` seems to me i don ' t remember altering any law about that ' ' .	575.2806
he straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .	16891.66
`` stay right here where you are , kid ' ' , he called .	81.90348
`` i don ' t aim to have minors breathing down my neck when i ' m a-drinking ' '	2845.976
he didn ' t stop till he was within three feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leader ' s right hand was on the butt of his revolver .	476.1665
`` i ' m billy tilghman ' ' , said the stranger , `` and i ' ve come for pat conyers ' body ' ' .	230.32245
`` and what makes you think you ' re going to get it , pretty boy ' ' ? ?	38.48024
most of the time i get what i ask for ' ' .	108.243614
`` the kid has no manners , boys .	13.698115
shall we teach him some ' ' ? ?	1.0795304
his gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .	543.22833
tilghman ' s clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .	1142.0208
his head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .	3117.877
tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .	1976.0021
a bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from tilghman ' s stomach as blue throat ' s henchmen started shooting .	6308.871
tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .	225.91252
the colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .	1417.79
somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` you all right , billy ' ' ? ?	208.80396
`` yes , george , but i ain ' t got poor old pat ' s body yet .	727.1247
and i aim to have it ' ' .	2.2061367
he fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .	4715.3667
another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .	152.28975
`` ok , tilghman , i ' m quitting ' ' .	361.44092
tilghman and his partner , george rust , herded the men into a corner .	990.0445
`` and now ' ' , said tilghman with deadly calm , `` i ' ll repeat what i said .	289.26373
i ' ve come for pat conyers ' body ' ' .	100.43726
in two minutes the body of tilghman ' s former comrade , who had been killed by blue throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town ' s funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .	555.11707
blue throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .	512.82025
`` that critter will be back tomorrow ' ' , predicted george rust , `` and he ' ll bring fifty of his kind back with him .	297.70102
blue throat won ' t stand for this .	7.52292
he ' ll shoot up the town ' ' .	2.0602684
the reverend james doran had scarcely completed pat conyers ' last rites on boot hill in the township of petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .	2200.9436
`` amen ' ' , said the reverend doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere ' ' .	857.53925
billy tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .	269.22687
blue throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .	939.6873
it was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored wild west method of doing it .	2142.5522
he rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to main street .	6095.3853
the entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .	2817.843
any posse riding down the street to demand blue throat ' s surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .	583.7
the law-abiding citizens of petrie had gathered inside kaster ' s store , halfway down the street .	838.47644
he sized up the situation and shook his head .	21.686754
`` if blue throat has his way he ' ll keep us all cooped up in here for days ' ' , he said .	141.79752
`` there ' s only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store ' ' .	258.9238
he called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .	391.15048
`` i ' m gonna drop these into blue throat ' s lap ' ' , he announced , `` and i ' d like every gun to be firing into that barn while i get near enough to toss ' em through the window ' ' .	191.70442
he slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .	4671.6714
blue throat ' s men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .	3339.4412
fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber ' s shop and came out at the back .	176.16374
here he couldn ' t be seen by blue throat and his gang .	1728.8143
all he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .	937.3329
within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .	30372.527
it was the abrupt end of blue throat ' s dictatorship in petrie .	1381.0647
though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .	350.88376
to tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash- ' em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .	671.8711
of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the old west , `` uncle billy tilghman ' ' stands out head and shoulders .	749.1584
he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .	1253.3467
he saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other u . s . marshal who lived before or after him .	742.19
for fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west .	398.99326
the deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because billy tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the west have remained almost unsung .	2400.244
citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .	510.36224
he came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the doolin gang which terrorized oklahoma in the 1890 ' s .	1442.9509
led by bill doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .	4307.17
bill doolin ' s ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of jesse james and billy the kid , and bill tilghman had sworn he would stop him .	1387.194
tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the doolin gang .	6538.0283
they bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .	804.40515
billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named ed dunn , who lived at rock fort .	592.849
on a bitterly cold day in january , 1895 , accompanied only by neal brown as his deputy , tilghman left the township of guthrie and headed for rock fort and dunn ' s ranch .	3227.7183
it was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .	320.21783
the only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .	1914.1122
the two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .	48.787994
`` if i don ' t come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse ' ' .	281.00204
leaving his rifle in the wagon , tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .	134.83687
there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .	458.3559
directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .	1696.0569
seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , ed dunn .	1158.6997
the rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn ' t move .	60.980675
tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .	273.6625
suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .	1418.8301
along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .	2872.1707
and projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on billy tilghman .	12716.4795
the fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .	3933.964
thinking fast , tilghman never hesitated for one instant .	299.28818
he walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .	2216.4116
the men behind them were bill doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer .	697.54193
`` cold day ' ' , said tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .	1361.0607
`` just dropped in to ask where jed hawkins lives .	4474.5044
can ' t seem to locate landmarks in this snow ' ' .	105.504425
he wouldn ' t look tilghman in the face .	88.51706
`` follow the river for five miles ' ' , he said hoarsely .	290.72867
`` jed ' s homestead is on the south bank ' ' .	34.501415
resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .	7628.756
all that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .	111.912865
one false move on his part and he would be a dead man .	90.05671
`` well ' ' , he announced , `` guess i ' ll be going now , ed , and thanks for the warmup ' ' .	247.49059
he strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .	5051.8013
he left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been allowed to come out alive .	617.08563
but he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .	190.7008
if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .	486.83456
leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown .	2794.3884
`` don ' t say or do anything ' ' , he said softly .	15.402822
`` just get out of here without it looking as though we ' re in a hurry .	196.0981
that place is crawling with bill doolin and his gang ' ' .	65.86739
even as he spoke those words billy tilghman ' s life hung on a thread .	143.70609
back in the house a hoodlum named red buck , sore because billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .	653.1272
`` you ' ll stay right here ' ' , commanded bill doolin , covering red with his rifle .	3578.3267
`` billy tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .	33.983627
but the fighting marshal ' s fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at cromwell , oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .	487.95084
wiley lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .	578.5037
that night he reeled out of ma murphy ' s dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .	332.11993
for several months now , jack carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a woman .	997.20544
this woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth	1035.2656
she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .	725.35266
when she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .	718.8152
then he would run to the toilet behind the house .	34.187828
sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this woman was almost always with him .	105.32458
he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .	212.78362
but they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .	248.33107
and so when miss langford came to teach at the one-room chestnut school , where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the woman of jack ' s mind assumed the teacher ' s face and figure .	302.45993
he could not keep his eyes off her when at school	667.2398
when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .	200.68286
when he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .	123.134735
miss langford ( her first name was evelyn ) was an attractive girl .	195.44211
tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .	5334.0103
something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now	274.5463
but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear ) you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like jack .	511.45563
she would look at jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and jack would see the woman and become breathless and a little sick .	446.4566
school began in august , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days miss langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .	328.7008
the first two or three days they went home early .	621.1816
he hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened desks and put the room in order .	3191.2034
once ( this was on the third day of school ) she kneeled down to pick up some books where they ' d dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .	684.41437
he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .	649.4874
about that time miss langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn ' t even see him .	179.4103
he jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .	443.03424
he didn ' t look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath	223.26268
`` i ' ll get her yet ' ' , he muttered to himself .	97.26464
`` i ' ve got to get her ' ' .	2.9148016
that night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .	300.04922
he ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .	7411.5596
`` what ' s the matter , honey ' ' ? ?	8.095764
she said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .	849.917
`` aren ' t you hungry ' ' ? ?	3.61884
`` no , i ' m not hungry ' ' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .	154.2447
outside it was already hot at 7 30 a . m . , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .	53.000935
he felt a little sick at his stomach .	4.112778
i guess it ' s this hot weather ' ' .	5.6753883
`` don ' t you play hard today then .	401.78067
and if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .	451.6088
daddy left the car for me , and i ' m going to town this afternoon ' ' .	76.2797
`` ok . , i won ' t play hard ' ' , he promised .	78.469986
just then charles lever yelled , `` hey , jack ' ' , from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house , and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` good-bye , mom ' ' over his shoulder .	734.384
`` whaddya say , boy ' ' ? ?	1.0408716
charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .	306.72913
charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an indian ' s and sharp brown eyes .	1257.3466
he considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .	121.65561
`` you know what i done last night ' ' ? ?	3.0536392
charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the dixie highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .	402.3566
jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were charles ' only apparent interest .	1783.8605
but jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from charles ' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .	720.19135
`` i got margaret rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry ' ' .	547.3571
a nude imaginary picture of miss langford flashed across jack ' s mind .	160.52608
he said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles .	288.8881
`` how ' d you do it ' ' ? ?	3.35339
`` hell , i jist got on top of -- ' '	82.91944
`` no , i mean how ' d you get her to do it ' ' ? ?	44.021408
`` hell , i jist ask her ' ' .	2.0273235
she ' s been hangin ' around me a lot here lately , and i figgered i might as well ' s try it .	810.72424
besides i heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin ' it ' ' .	209.94852
if you ' d get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself ' ' .	397.51642
`` i might try it one of these days ' ' , jack said wonderingly , thinking of miss langford .	1821.7504
when they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip ' ' in front of the schoolhouse .	373.9212
miss langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .	788.0372
`` time for books ' ' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .	11197.302
`` oh , come on miss langford , play with us just onct ' ' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .	861.29346
`` no , not now ' ' , said the teacher .	102.469505
the children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .	297.6681
he could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles had said that morning about margaret rider .	1566.041
occasionally he would look across the aisle at margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what charles had said she did .	731.80975
at noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except charles , went off out the road to play ball .	659.2788
`` why ain ' t you playin ' ball ' ' ? ?	33.31538
he asked charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .	1385.9445
`` miss langford , come out and play with us like you promised ' ' , several of the little girls called .	186.40086
`` i ' d druther stay here and watch the girls ' ' , charles grinned .	215.47186
`` maybe some of ' em will fall down and we ' ll see up their dress ' ' .	57.161785
`` maybe ' ' , jack said idly , watching for miss langford .	3010.1055
when she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` goody , goody ' ' .	1366.1918
`` let ' s play with ' em ' ' , jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .	354.04898
`` o . k . ' ' charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .	235.989
they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .	1981.347
then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls , jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .	573.2384
while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` gosh , i ' m sorry , miss langford .	408.7037
i didn ' t mean to pull so hard ' ' .	15.444762
`` that ' s all right ' ' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .	115.83969
with one hand she held her skirt down while she took jack ' s extended hand with the other .	485.54788
when her hand touched his , fire went through jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .	263.49823
he thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .	444.4076
`` thank you ' ' , she said , dusting herself off .	1702.4816
`` will you play with us again , miss langford ' ' ? ?	938.0389
`` oh , shucks ' ' , the girl said .	128.49203
`` i don ' t believe i ' ll play any more neither ' ' .	167.37477
`` me neither ' ' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .	448.42398
jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past robert allen ' s three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .	641.91907
when he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .	69.03475
he simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .	280.24078
that should do it , he thought , because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .	1502.8195
he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn ' t take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .	340.07962
the only drawback now to the plan he ' d decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with jack .	531.112
`` but i ' ve got to take a chance on it ' ' , he told himself desperately .	78.43041
`` all right , if you can ' t do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out ' ' , miss langford said firmly , not smiling .	698.6344
`` you will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems ' ' .	340.4658
and so when the others stampeded out that afternoon jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .	1361.4275
his heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` how will i do it ? ?	320.152
on the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .	3002.8801
she munched little ginger cakes called mulatto ' s belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .	3739.0195
the youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .	177.41068
lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .	296.95798
the haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured `` look at your watch , col . garvier .	2550.5742
it is almost time for and calinda to begin ' ' .	62.058796
col . henri garvier was one of new orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .	624.5008
he chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .	900.50104
the slaves ran gaily to the center of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny no-name .	9816.343
johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .	1470.3733
the drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds .	2052.8337
the white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .	9981.488
he was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .	551.38995
he proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was madame delphine lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , dr . louis lalaurie , who bore one of the south ' s oldest and most cherished names .	942.07587
she was a top horsewoman and one of the city ' s most gracious hostesses .	843.4883
although new orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on american soil .	1353.1989
madame lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .	2743.2046
the slender , handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by the other slaves .	4161.816
he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .	2043.2595
but dandy had had little experience with girls on his master ' s plantation in bayou st . john .	456.1448
shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls ' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .	983.8076
this young slave was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .	10425.454
the woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .	2116.449
`` what is your name , boy ? ?	1.1120474
i won ' t bite , you know ' ' .	4.6069493
he gaped at madame lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which emanated from her .	5939.106
`` my name is dandy brandon , missy .	12.953483
i belong to master alexander prieur ' ' .	1.9399568
she said with intense feeling `` come near , let me feel your arms .	356.01193
you look quite strong and healthy to me , dandy ' ' .	116.697975
mrs . lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .	1481.6548
lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .	963.6724
the woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .	1322.9076
once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .	1919.4454
satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .	5027.7363
this was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .	22879.732
i want you to find monsieur prieur at once and give him this money for the boy ' s purchase .	86.4333
if the old fool argues about the price , tell him i shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .	285.40787
one less shouldn ' t matter to him ' ' .	2.8591778
aristide devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native sierra leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat .	8971.743
his bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .	748.6466
`` another youth , madame ' ' ? ?	1.3662825
`` this one is a tender chicken , oui ? ?	14770.321
it will rip and shred easily for madame ' ' .	6.694536
the tall coachman walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur .	14708.403
delphine lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove dandy brandon -- cowering in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at 677 perdido street .	12897.3
dr . louis lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .	764.43195
dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .	119.099884
he saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .	2337.12
dr . lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .	15302.065
`` another young man , my dear ? ?	1.095206
really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself ' ' , he said , frowning with displeasure .	495.32825
delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .	8753.989
`` dandy is to be our house guest , louis .	1797.415
i want the room in the attic prepared for him he is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .	475.51874
he deserves a better life than just rotting away on the prieur plantation ' ' .	499.50153
his room will be ready shortly ' ' .	1.7772901
the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .	2401.4023
had dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the lalauries ' tender care if he valued his life .	906.03906
but he liked the smell of delphine ' s perfume .	206.47911
besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .	1109.7478
also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .	196.42947
so dandy brandon trustingly entered the house with delphine lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .	1658.4207
airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at bayou st . john .	2192.5
he bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when madame lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .	1893.3662
it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .	474.21854
when he finally left the sinister mansion on perdido street , he was carried out in a coroner ' s basket .	510.49173
just six weeks after dandy brandon ' s arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only new orleans ' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .	1487.5636
a stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from paris , and louisiana politics .	3964.085
suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .	7305.002
it was dandy brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .	3451.3032
the lad ' s once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .	1141.1813
his pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .	9.062918
feebly he pointed an accusing finger at madame lalaurie and shouted `` evil woman ! !	9285.227
you did this you like to hurt to beat people i want to go home ' ' .	54.208744
these were the last words he ever uttered .	10.615158
convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator gaston berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .	32588.693
dr . louis lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .	1767.1598
guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie and made speedy departures .	5532.4883
delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .	1334.0056
but at the coroner ' s inquest delphine told a forthright story .	2084.721
`` i saw the boy dandy at the congo square festivities and felt sorry for him .	768.3524
it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .	244.80827
after i paid monsieur prieur for dandy , i brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .	212.86469
how he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , i cannot say .	64.73453
dr . lalaurie and i didn ' t even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs ' ' .	95.083565
she daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion `` that poor boy ! !	5153.547
he must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .	274.77695
ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .	290.00067
though the slave ' s dying words about the woman troubled the coroner ' s panel , dandy ' s accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .	2559.0264
the lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury didn ' t feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .	542.3183
moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in new orleans ' dives .	1469.4839
so the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown ' ' , and the elite of the city , accepting delphine ' s testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .	333.0237
once again life went its serene way -- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .	18786.947
the excitement over brandon ' s bizarre death abated and madame lalaurie ' s stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .	5355.6636
then , on july 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .	2916.4246
mrs . victor dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .	2929.7078
the manservant devol and his mistress , delphine lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the lalaurie mansion .	5717.479
she was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .	4239.2124
the coachman and delphine were gaining on her as she raced down perdido street .	3579.371
the fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice `` help me , somebody ! !	193.98756
they have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !	3426.2385
`` bastards ' ' , he would say , `` all i did was put a beat to that vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me ' ' ! !	622.8734
since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from greenwich village to the embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .	3489.22
`` there ain ' t nothin ' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace ' ' , feathertop would say .	3866.8362
`` the accommodations may not be the poshest , but man ! !	154.53595
there ain ' t nobody askin ' for your ticket stub , neither ' ' .	1095.5173
he had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .	323.46976
ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the quartet , and midge and the child .	471.12622
it had been a very long time that had no form and no end .	256.798
he was -- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out .	790.8442
out and out and never to return again .	14.492949
till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .	419.62262
the freight car was cold , early in the morning .	32.079956
he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .	1152.5599
he held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .	10315.546
the train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open	1822.462
at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot .	556.8297
the boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .	67.374405
she pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and feathertop ' s music pfffted away .	4582.5537
`` now that is a very nice , a very nice ' ' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .	172.62138
a little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .	297.89856
hot , that was the word , hot ! !	73.55902
hair like a morning-frightened sparrow ' s wings , with the sun shining down over them .	186.8377
his thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .	560.1631
then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .	633.64716
he was less to see , but feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .	354.9813
curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer ' s blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe i can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then i ' m finished .	426.73706
`` we made it , cappy ' ' , the chick said .	832.1418
`` yeah , seems so , don ' t it ' ' , the boy laughed , hugging her close .	326.76987
we run a respectable house here ' ' .	1.6784931
they whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .	6969.611
he was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .	935.5999
`` come sit ' ' , said feathertop , motioning them toward him .	3961.8289
`` that crap is softer over here ' ' .	1.2895006
the boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .	235.34329
`` now stay with me , kitty ' ' , he snapped irritably .	644.8191
`` i vowed to take care of you -- and that ' s what i ' m gonna do .	111.89376
we don ' t know this guy ' ' .	2.4007072
`` oooo , square bit ' ' , feathertop screwed his face up .	8894.33
`` what is with this vow jazz ' ' ? ?	6.350719
feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight ' s vibrating wall .	2883.1812
`` we -- we eloped ' ' , cappy said .	8068.1685
feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .	18.56792
these two were going to be easy pickins .	3.1375928
they couldn ' t have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums feathertop rolled had much .	5731.756
and besides , the chick had a little something the others didn ' t have .	263.8187
he liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .	1730.9681
`` come sit ' ' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .	12102.195
`` i ' m just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- boyd smith ' ' .	2190.349
`` that ain ' t your name , mister ' ' , the boy accused .	330.843
`` and you know -- you ' re right ' ' ! !	38.94942
`` oh , come on , cappy ' ' , the girl chided .	700.13684
she started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant cappy behind her .	6965.292
feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .	914.77264
it had been a long , hot while since he ' d seen anything as nice as this within grabbin ' distance .	1484.9188
he had it all doped , of course .	14.880796
slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to philadelphia -- and then have a rockin ' ball with the doll .	281.07666
`` where ' d you come from , mr . -- uh -- mr . smith ' ' ? ?	187.29637
i been riding train for a ways now ' ' .	15.565854
they lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .	3122.1228
after a while , kitty murmured something to cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` we ' ll just have to wait till we pull into philly , honey ' ' .	645.7785
`` what ' s the matter , she wanna go the bathroom ' ' ? ?	504.36868
the boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .	531.9088
certainly not , i mean , no that isn ' t what i said ' ' ! !	26.909172
we haven ' t had anything to eat all day ' ' .	27.368382
joviality suffused feathertop ernie cargill ' s voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .	1315.4403
`` whyn ' t ya say so , fellow travelers ! !	4291.0977
c ' mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we ' ll have food in a minute or two ' ' .	118.745865
cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .	5870.384
he took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .	1164.9116
he put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .	387.56616
`` a charcoal pit , man ' ' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .	5470.5054
`` fan it ' ' , he told cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .	5528.369
`` yeah , but what ' re we gonna eat ? ?	2147.3801
`` fella ' ' , ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my ever-lovin ' patience ' ' .	1272.5105
he reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .	932.1319
not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides ' ' .	2000.4493
he ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .	864.4805
`` a kroger ' s self-serve ' ' , he explained .	25.662987
when they had licked the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and cappy offered ernie a cigarette .	2915.8225
nice kid , ernie thought , too bad .	29.216146
`` how come you ' re riding the rods , kids like you ' ' ? ?	156.28304
cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .	78.355644
but surprisingly , kitty ' s face came up and she said , `` my father .	63.620575
he didn ' t want us to get married .	298.40314
`` why didn ' t he want you to get hitched ' ' ? ?	64.12479
she looked down at her hands , too .	8.954868
after a few seconds , she said , `` dad didn ' t like cappy .	2022.6041
if i ' d been careful it never woulda ' ' -- he stopped abruptly .	1347.3024
`` what ' s the matter ' ' ? ?	6.77034
the girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` i ' m pregnant ' ' .	63.989597
`` oh he was stupid , her old man ! !	17.334242
you never heard nothin ' like it kitty ' s gonna go have an abortion , and kitty ' s gonna go away to a convent , and kitty ' s this and kitty ' s that like he was nuts or somethin ' , y ' know ' ' ? ?	497.7872
but that had been a time before all this , a time he didn ' t think about .	68.95366
a time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .	780.7809
but these kids weren ' t like him .	19.454855
he thought , pull out of it , old son .	1037.2239
these are just another couple of characters to roll .	1335.6987
ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .	1400.9956
the answer came from the open door of the boxcar .	6442.6655
from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .	268.0829
real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .	676.844
`` you gonna give me a drink , fella ' ' ? ?	202.72736
the big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .	1292.1466
`` sure ' ' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .	275.86224
he guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .	1088.1116
the man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .	574.2575
he took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .	2412.9106
he threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .	21385.42
he belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .	326.8049
`` well , now ' ' , he said , and reached into his pocket .	89.753365
`` i didn ' t know i was gonna have company in this car ' ' .	703.48566
`` we ' re going to philadelphia ' ' , kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .	671.8653
`` no , i don ' t think so ' ' , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for ernie .	141.6179
he had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .	73.77009
`` maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain ' t goin ' nowhere ' ' .	391.8545
he advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .	217.61586
ernie was screaming inside himself no , damn you , you ain ' t gonna take my meal ticket away from me ! !	1217.2305
the newcomer stalked toward them , and kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .	762.99713
her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .	405.27823
and carried him backward in a footballer ' s tackle .	116.15298
they went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .	634.04675
the kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .	2148.1162
the fist went down into the pile of flesh , and ernie heard the bigger man ' s deeper voice go , `` aaawww ' ' ! !	522.3834
then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .	624.6431
he held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud .	417.26337
the blade came out with a snick ! !	1.8507617
he fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid ' s throat .	214.64238
kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .	8.132094
she grabbed at feathertop ' s sleeve and shrieked , `` help him ! !	466.02795
they neither liked nor disliked the old man .	16.250416
to them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after mass , and at noon , and at six each evening -- its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets .	1127.0533
yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june	497.64288
or the smell of thick tomato paste -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour -- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .	14345.435
or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .	4539.327
or the bay of female dogs in heat .	18.94597
they never called him by name , although he had one .	42.74731
filippo rossi , that ' s what he was called in the old country	73.80352
but here he was just signore or the old man .	56.076813
but this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .	619.796
it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession .	707.53033
but youth asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .	412.9718
the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened .	232.85349
but the past was dead here as the present was dead .	220.31528
once the old man had had a wife .	15.033276
and once she , too , ignored him .	15.288292
with a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn ' t stop .	2015.3575
in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .	879.21234
the way she strutted down the street , the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both .	192.67372
without looking at him , without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back .	566.55615
`` but she shouldn ' t have come here in the first place ' ' , the women had said .	38.642406
she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from torino ' ' .	1766.5702
just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours ' ' .	166.45827
`` it ' s not for making pretty speeches about dante those actresses get paid so good ' ' .	4028.9993
calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away .	33538.434
mauve-colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man ' s tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .	194.05382
but if the old man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .	901.8585
it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed -- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .	746.705
his voice had not commanded her to stop .	26.45656
but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .	3962.116
) and his eyes -- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction .	1985.4061
the old man ' s very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he wouldn ' t have had anyone know it .	146.50446
perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .	270.18045
but when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ? ?	542.0552
there seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .	294.78278
for all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in italy , not the outskirts of philadelphia .	266.6935
it could have been bari or chieti for the way it smelled .	629.6113
what did it matter to him that the park at the foot of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city ' s center at half-hour intervals ? ?	1856.6113
or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the schuylkill ? ?	248.56992
this place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .	1438.2963
to him they were one and the same .	54.022305
sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .	792.88806
sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .	1639.6732
it slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .	13849.681
it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .	3108.7795
even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it .	705.6476
and the coffee shop on drexel street , where the men spent their evenings and sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .	1572.8121
the hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .	41.746277
only one house on the street had no lawn before it .	926.1
it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .	6386.6963
above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .	5064.9565
did the old man remember them there ? ?	1.100359
yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks -- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .	667.93726
only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man ' s property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .	1767.2972
love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines .	2605.6104
and the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .	699.4958
the old man silently fed upon these streets .	13.686592
waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .	80.34824
it was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .	103.370926
the old man ' s son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .	307.17642
at fifteen he didn ' t care that he had no mother , that he couldn ' t remember her face or her touch	132.40895
neither did he care that aunt rose provided for him .	29.913645
he was named pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he couldn ' t have cared less about that either .	193.0251
to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .	606.2737
when he would be a man , he would be a rich man .	56.271576
he would not be like the `` rich americans ' ' who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .	265.36575
he would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .	117.16254
he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .	774.9741
he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , `` at your service ' ' .	1053.2388
he would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not remove his gloves -- and light and smoke .	695.2735
he could do that when he would be a man .	42.14088
he called to his sister on the porch above the steps .	90.5884
she was only ten months older than he .	181.01704
`` laura , what would you say if i smoked a pipe ' ' ? ?	249.54457
she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun .	753.86163
one lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales .	18311.836
her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes -- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white .	11833.635
all the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .	25343.846
it was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours .	4281.41
the eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .	265.46786
even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .	508.85977
he was never sure they fully took him in .	131.7687
pompeii called again , `` laura ' ' ! !	28.648077
but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .	2010.1261
`` she ' s in a mood ' ' , he thought `` there ' s not a month she doesn ' t get herself in a mood ' ' .	65.953445
well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? ?	312.7445
and as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .	191.92403
suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat ' s claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him .	1660.9943
above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him .	11973.344
`` christ sake , goat , git ' ' ! !	7.3548923
`` you ' re boiling milk , ain ' t you ' ' ? ?	22.572866
his head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .	10078.923
with his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .	572.39606
the boy ' s fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .	2452.619
above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .	1308.5518
but the boy could see only the goat ' s belly .	56.279545
the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .	4908.5107
he knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn ' t raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog ' s back .	146.86557
there would be time enough , perhaps the old man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .	442.5066
in the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as pompeii ' s shaved hair , edged up close to him .	1524.1188
the clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .	1011.47565
he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to niobe , the neatest ones to concetta , and the laced ones to romeo , concetta ' s idiot brother .	13806.899
pompeii expected romeo ' s small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .	417.12134
he expected concetta ' s thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .	1412.6571
people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .	96.65113
the room filled with smoke , and maggie ' s head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie couldn ' t bear to do anything to quench it .	1125.335
little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .	5.8448887
in two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head .	1460.5477
she stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food	4372.407
she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her .	596.96106
she was so heavy that maggie ' s arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .	1426.3522
maggie couldn ' t seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back	1060.5306
there was the daily round of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating .	1753.4229
worry had a great deal to do with it	47.99311
stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father ' s office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .	247.01852
mr . clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife ' s people without contributing to his and his family ' s upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .	307.48065
maggie and stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more .	307.12003
in desperation maggie consulted eugenia one afternoon `` do you think you could find me something i could do here at home to make some money , so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ' ' ? ?	125.129776
`` it seems to me you have enough to do as it is ' ' , eugenia said .	140.01393
she had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .	333.45847
`` i have plenty of odd moments when i could be doing something ' ' , maggie said .	136.30501
`` it would make me feel a lot better , but the woman ' s exchange isn ' t taking baked goods any more and i can ' t leave the baby with grandma because she isn ' t strong enough and the baby ' s too young to be put in a nursery ' ' .	257.914
`` i should think so ' ' , eugenia said .	27897.777
`` for one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day ' ' .	1462.0792
`` she ' s so beautiful , and i do like to keep her looking nice ' ' .	196.09155
she picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .	4704.0117
`` she ' ll be just as beautiful in something that doesn ' t have to be ironed ' ' , eugenia said .	409.13306
`` evadna mae evans said she didn ' t put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old ' ' .	1245.5497
`` evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from best ' s liliputian bazaar in new york , and i ' m sick and tired of hearing about evadna mae evans ' ' .	2058.8206
`` well now , maggie , you don ' t have to snap at me ' ' , eugenia said .	186.39108
`` i ' m just thinking of a way for you to be sensible ' ' .	92.55058
i do seem to snap at everybody these days , but i would like to think of a way to make a little extra money ' ' .	42.246014
let ' s make a list of your assets ' ' .	51.52435
maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn ' t stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining .	386.75757
when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures .	2304.1177
`` i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers ' ' , eugenia said .	476.9348
`` we could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it ' s nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that ' ' .	721.7418
`` you might set up a dress shop in the living room ' ' .	10.66759
`` every woman in the block has tried that ' ' .	16.918438
`` what about a tea room , then ? ?	115.792915
you could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes ' ' .	1003.65454
and grandma isn ' t strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am i ' ' .	125.11516
she said , `` well , those are the really interesting things , but if you don ' t like any of those i can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough ' ' .	147.34326
`` oh , i ' m sure i could do that ' ' , maggie said .	119.916664
`` but it really wouldn ' t be fair , taking your jobs away from you ' ' .	133.4612
`` don ' t worry , i can get plenty more ' ' , eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could .	499.42313
maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so eugenia wouldn ' t be ashamed of it .	800.36554
`` and then whenever i have a minute i can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time .	95.82762
and i can go back to my contests and be thinking while i ' m doing the washing ' ' .	120.1444
`` what are you going to do with your feet so you don ' t waste anything ' ' ? ?	39.891823
she said , `` oh eugenia , i wish ' '	28.051832
`` i wish i had three wishes ' ' , maggie said .	127.45739
`` all of them for you ' ' .	2.9171326
it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people .	845.62823
the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .	424.15234
the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile high city , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance	3300.0762
it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources .	11850.734
the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies .	759.2405
there weren ' t facilities to take care of them	44.14059
there never had been a need felt for such facilities .	87.55947
that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .	1120.0345
the east was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along	1013.4816
and now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay .	195.39375
the government offices were being opened but they weren ' t being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything .	875.1109
all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done .	592.57056
it was the theme song of millions of american people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .	108.88417
the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day .	268.97858
something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills	580.9685
about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .	704.3533
just dropping the baby ' s bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .	694.02277
the abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold .	2025.145
cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof .	3292.1892
presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in grandma ' s room .	383.87717
it was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive .	4021.502
the pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .	3957.0447
they moved maggie ' s bed and the baby ' s basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds .	1141.448
grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .	278.85065
eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin .	780.9909
she said to maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .	214.76675
`` plenty of people are poor all their lives ' ' .	5.8720155
`` plenty of people haven ' t our brains and talent ' ' .	318.1886
`` i know you when you start talking about brains and talent ' ' , maggie said .	340.0577
`` you ' re working up to something , and if you don ' t watch out you ' ll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression ' ' .	212.82957
`` the only thing that worries me is how i ' m going to prove it ' ' , eugenia said .	117.3137
they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way .	439.60934
she didn ' t want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that hope have the heater .	462.165
hope wouldn ' t hear of it , and she took the heater back to grandma ' s room , and grandma took it back to hope ' s room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire .	1058.8954
she said that proved she wasn ' t to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it .	211.93474
eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but hope said if grandma wouldn ' t have the heater nobody would have it , so grandma had to give in .	480.82193
`` thrifty of her to use it up .	7.6611977
unusual in a case like this , but ' ' --	45.127686
this ought to simplify tolley ' s life ' ' .	4.595561
he ' d mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny had jilted him for roy robards .	3916.3406
`` it was plain as the nose on your face that they ' re laughing about it , mamma .	237.58902
zion stayed to get my pin , but it ' ll be a cold day in june when i go back ' ' .	56.6417
`` we will both go back , laban ' ' ! !	4.3161497
`` let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , mamma .	550.54663
why should i want pictures of an empty room now ? ?	106.105156
tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little jenny ! !	888.4719
this -- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and i am going to see that everybody at mt . pleasant understands that simple fact .	1095.8281
wait for me , laban , i ' ll be dressed in half a second ' ' ! !	105.83987
frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back .	176.81317
they ' re not going to laugh at the fairbrothers and labans very long ! !	5007.2324
you know it and i ' ll tell everybody exactly how it happened ' ' .	82.91146
she was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .	3632.2307
`` make your confession to god , kizzie dear , not to the congregation ' ' .	97.47362
`` i ' ll decide that when i get there .	138.84546
i was so cruel to tolley , so unfair .	717.64526
but i ' ll be fair now ! !	1.1898893
he is coming back , isn ' t he , frank ' ' ? ?	72.463425
returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from jonathan swift on his lips	5770.323
put this man and woman asunder ' ' .	2.019736
he questioned god ' s taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .	931.9572
if he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .	177.49995
in any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own .	1935.3828
it was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .	403.398
`` you ' ve told god , frank ' ' , he said .	9.05036
`` why lacerate the -- congregation ' ' ? ?	12.567233
reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash .	3209.9504
surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .	111.92043
`` ' and let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' ' ' .	595.2715
a beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did .	820.1478
but there were great satisfactions , even for a small man .	61.451744
beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life .	695.11707
there lay grand fair ' s quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .	1416.0521
he poured his thimble of wine for the toast he ' d made so often .	306.18655
but this last time he drank not to brace but `` to tolley ' ' ! !	556.6348
mr . robards -- jenny was the only person she knew of in the mt . pleasant neighborhood who called him that -- was kind but too easygoing .	1230.369
it didn ' t bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , `` howdy , miss jenny ' ' , adding a careless `` roy ' ' , but it did her .	577.18835
he could put a stop to it , she told him again and again .	86.68722
simply call mr . whipsnade oscar , and dr . dunne p . ga , and c ' un major frank .	1427.6505
mr . robards laughed , said he ' d feel a damn fool , plain-out couldn ' t do that even to please her .	1581.6649
and if i ever hear you say ' mist laban ' again i ' ll scream .	4315.9443
and don ' t tell me you didn ' t at church sunday .	78.82648
he really hadn ' t meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on mr . robards .	284.7973
how strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in -- spiritual ways .	2688.4277
another weakness -- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of tolley ' s .	487.1831
but mr . robards ' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes ! !	189.98206
he called her `` the mare ' ' much as mrs . whipsnade spoke of `` the queen , god bless her ' ' .	270.33392
he , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of `` the mare ' ' , `` the racin ' mare ' ' , the revolting gunny .	2053.9697
for the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall .	2481.0728
nerves , mr . robards said , just a nip anyway .	9439.394
`` stand back , miss jen , she ' s oneasy of your scarf ' ' .	1685.2897
never , `` quit that , you sor ' l devil ' ' ! !	114.39304
never concern for his wife ' s nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in january .	1011.15063
she musn ' t annoy gunny whose foal was due then too ! !	523.9588
listening for hours to his laments that the war and `` mist fair ' s ' ' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it .	1025.3168
gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant -- tolley , the indifference with which the fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach .	1357.1418
tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested .	965.5334
jenny ' s aversion to having dr . dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .	899.29095
the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .	434.68314
he would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian ! !	2205.9712
night after night he stayed with gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house .	7190.7607
yet when the dear baby came , he had tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .	746.652
jenny wished now that she had had dr . dunne , feeling that somehow he wouldn ' t have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets .	1330.1609
there was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn ' t been the son he wanted , saying , `` you don ' t see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , miss jen , hon .	820.5934
rhyme ' em up cute -- arcilla , flotilla ' '	6440.7056
edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , jennifer , for herself , and --	798.5228
`` kezziah , for miss kizzie ' ' , he suggested .	60.603924
`` she was mighty good to you past times , an ' this ' ll fetch her ' ' .	561.9888
now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special .	203.32506
just wait till she saw the mare ' s foal .	5355.255
strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old .	156.08865
`` why don ' t you name him jesus christ ! !	104.54889
he ' d had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been .	783.01605
of course she wasn ' t herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn ' t seem to rise with it .	170.45854
those elegant `` at home ' ' cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , hadn ' t brought many callers in two whole months .	1029.5222
so had miss shawnee rakestraw , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his heavenly rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather , was looking forward to quinzaine spa this summer .	1770.8124
miss kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you ' d have thought a namesake would have brought her round .	443.8663
oh , she ' d come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips .	1888.1288
but when miss jen went over right away to return the call , miss kiz couldn ' t have been very cordial , for she ' d come back before she hardly had time to get there .	428.61243
more and more , these days , she ' d been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to tillie ' s and nick ' s -- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies .	2538.0706
though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too .	172.97601
it made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea miss sis had given him , to be told by miss kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain mrs . robards and the children .	514.12573
he didn ' t tell miss jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit .	1114.881
if he ever did such a thing again she ' d die of shame .	393.7819
`` have a party an ' leave ' em out , hon ' ' , he suggested .	66.16414
`` a swell party , send an invite to ever ' body but them -- those folks you met at the galt house , the ones i ' ve got to know in this new jockey club affair , the whole dang neighborhood .	1050.4496
we ' ll have oystchers -- couple bar ' l oystchers ' ll fetch in a crowd any time .	2318.646
i ' ll see word gets round ' ' .	1.4651005
miss jen was funny that way , funny that she didn ' t seem to take to his ideas and perk up .	98.284874
he was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try .	202.796
zion was surprised when roy ' s buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that eph showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town .	1331.004
roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he ' d give her a lift to quinzaine .	799.2417
her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didn ' t notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were getting on .	462.3744
it won ' t take a minute ' ' .	1.7013927
he swung in through his own wide gateway .	7.8081
`` them ' s the purtiest babes you ever did see , but miss jen gets mighty lonesome .	6554.9287
she ' ll relish the sight of a friendly face .	529.3101
miss kiz won ' t care your comin ' , will she ' ' ? ?	28.201118
`` he must have forgiven me ' ' , henrietta murmured to the room .	685.516
the absolution of doaty ' s last will and testament was proof enough of that	1031.0854
doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .	2030.6113
she found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .	1235.9463
perhaps doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .	233.10445
henrietta thought , it ' s extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .	264.11423
there had been more to know about hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable .	231.2206
adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .	409.68576
their childhood would have been quite circumspect without hetty ' s flair for drama , especially through the long summers .	1161.9408
in winter , in the city , there had been the maneret school , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge	1266.0864
there had been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils	1940.1127
there had been the dancing class -- miss craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .	23495.871
there had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the blackwell planets revolved .	8061.2305
mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of charles .	230.78583
it was safe to assume that papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` thank god your poor mother was spared this ' ' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for henrietta to leave , with her hand in charles ' hand , just because her `` poor mother ' ' was gone already and would never know .	343.2988
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .	243.20265
but i would have gone anyway , thought henrietta .	1550.2262
she had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .	120.07613
only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in doaty ' s bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her .	1100.3743
perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .	297.18958
if adelia had felt about someone as henrietta felt about charles , would she have run away with him ? ?	503.9843
impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone .	19.504774
a curious thought to end a curious night .	16.646318
the birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of doaty ' s flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf .	1442.9839
before anything else , she would go to doaty ' s grave with flowers from doaty ' s forgotten garden .	4484.0684
everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .	5962.4478
she closed her eyes , remembering the small french cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .	737.9761
it had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .	125.1472
after the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .	180.19676
the garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .	10305.625
leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .	1369.2583
on a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .	1760.5037
it was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d ' un certain age .	1803.6387
feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs .	7730.203
rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that rosa was human .	3526.7964
feeling protective toward this sleeping being , henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .	1473.5059
outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady ' s bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing folly .	4452.204
the poodle came gleefully to henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .	6152.1445
henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty .	1866.8916
`` go change your shoes before you turn around ' ' .	16.28208
she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home .	1861.4913
folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .	17.314804
to a blackwell , there was only one church .	1806.3153
the cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .	118.736465
for the first time in thirty years , henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .	6224.076
she smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .	110.28283
now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .	71.98655
an old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .	694.8503
on an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .	874.03955
he cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .	512.6318
he then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic .	2280.595
`` summer ' s been slow to come ' ' , he said .	8.069951
`` it ' s my dryin ' out time ' ' .	10.426534
`` i ' m taking them to the cemetery ' ' , said henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .	250.03244
`` they ' ll be takin ' me next ' ' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so soon ' s they plan .	176.2181
see half of ' em in their graves before i choose my own coffin .	623.77106
it ' s dryin ' myself out that does it ' ' .	14.926442
`` you ' d like to hear how i go about it ' ' .	16.643145
`` it ' s nice of you ' ' , henrietta said doubtfully .	950.63074
he straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .	763.73785
his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .	1381.2471
`` every month , f ' r three days ' ' , he said happily , `` i take no water into my system , no water whatsoever .	194.75128
henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense .	472.89282
`` rests the tissues ' ' , he said , `` and pacifies the system .	756.84033
my dad did it , and he lived to a great age ' ' .	25.248384
`` don ' t remember , do you ' ' ? ?	2.9722004
she did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old titus , who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away .	564.0498
next to the blackwells , titus had owned the island most , and she and adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years -- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible .	1498.5797
he had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea .	919.20105
it must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .	1340.3231
she said gently , `` of course i remember you ' ' .	28.79754
`` not so well ' s i remember you ' ' , he said .	9.166822
`` y ' re the young blackwell woman .	38.625496
ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .	12952.668
`` you do seem to ' ' , said henrietta , impressed .	3075.5986
`` can ' t blame a man for leavin ' his wife ' ' , he said quite cheerfully .	605.6472
`` left mine many a time , only she never knew it .	62.155754
man in a boat , there ' s a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .	160.0406
`` probably ' ' , said henrietta dryly .	13.7634115
he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .	590.80664
`` you ' d be the one to say ' ' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different ' ' , since all actions had their own laws .	174.09575
only , this old man ' s connivance was even less to her taste than selma cotter ' s open censure .	3425.7974
well , she had not come back to great island to be understood , praised or condemned .	1547.7792
she had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .	227.48796
she started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress .	3726.727
she smiled vaguely at henrietta and spoke to the old man .	23.701788
`` you ' ve not had your breakfast yet , gran ' dad ' ' .	5436.476
`` y ' r dam ' porridge is no breakfast ' ' , he said .	39.785107
he beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones .	481.26624
`` he ' s lowly today ' ' , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .	896.92487
`` he ' s got this idea about drying out ' '	437.49933
`` it ain ' t an idea ' ' ! !	9.764721
`` if it ain ' t an idea ' ' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water ' ' ? ?	63.767456
he looked piously to heaven and said , `` beer don ' t affect the tissues none ' ' , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .	1056.8453
the children are eating , and miss blackwell ' s on her way somewheres ' ' .	206.1463
i ' ve got a day ' s work to do .	138.182
-- you ' ll be visiting miss doaty , ma ' am ' ' ? ?	124.89074
the woman ( she must have been a tiny baby when hetty and delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own .	7124.3584
`` god rest her soul , she was a sweet one .	521.0018
she put a strong hand under the old man ' s arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .	283.5872
he mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .	1291.7491
there was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man .	533.164
henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey ' s way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , folly dancing ahead of her .	967.03033
at the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep .	9467.477
they were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .	2822.2
the air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .	725.11615
she felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty .	1286.7721
both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` dorothy tredding ' ' seemed suddenly impossible .	1495.7839
she sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss .	11285.576
the day ' s sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade doaty ' s flowers .	874.4739
a small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .	222.61612
she remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .	2822.056
the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture , in the northeast of the main japanese island of honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious ainu strain .	847.86475
the ainus were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the japanese came from southern asia .	444.67743
all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .	289.9144
a pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the american indians .	1589.4076
most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the south .	2299.8489
tommy momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .	7.8339877
she was taller than most japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall .	620.3806
her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong .	1342.9966
her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about .	224.03746
she had black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody .	425.1192
she had been in japan just one week .	24.060013
it was an alien land , and she hated it intensely	7024.2075
she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at san diego , bremerton , the great lakes , pensacola -- any place the navy had a hospital -- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted .	1701.1085
anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors .	1893.3274
tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward .	26.431503
there were no depressingly serious cases the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor -- sometimes the navy sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high .	611.74646
at present the doctor ' s main concern was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore , because the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours .	3050.2588
tommy was interested in psychiatry , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients .	217.33267
such as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the officers ' club , having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime .	927.6332
she had changed into a cocktail dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck .	117.42418
this was one of the navy ' s crossroads -- you find them all around the world .	153.4634
ships from the west coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the seventh fleet , and yokosuka was the seventh fleet ' s principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty .	1286.1476
sooner or later , all the gray navy ships came in here	1120.8574
if tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long beach .	620.72675
and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there .	562.0746
she felt , rather than saw , the approach of the good-looking young man .	489.2259
he came through from the fleet bar , which was stag , with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried .	1997.3297
when he saw tommy sitting alone , the tinkling sound stopped .	41400.734
he was perhaps a trifle tipsy , having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out of practice	907.9559
he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in hong kong , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant .	159.05554
probably off one of the carriers -- an aviator .	8789.802
there was a fifty-fifty chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different .	262.14087
japan did something to a man -- and it wasn ' t just japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas .	429.66913
it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not ? ?	75.97463
then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different .	412.19843
he said , turning on what was meant to be charm .	104.985466
maybe you likee date with me ' ' ? ?	6.939132
`` i beg your pardon ' ' ! !	1.0372953
`` i don ' t believe i know you , and i can ' t understand your quaint brand of english -- it was meant to be english , wasn ' t it ' ' ? ?	89.97761
the nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels , open-mouthed and blushing .	7054.2217
at least , he had the decency to blush , she thought .	726.5937
`` oh -- i ' m sorry ! !	1.0698866
you see , i thought -- i mean i really had no idea ' ' --	120.09703
`` oh , yes -- you had ideas ' ' ! !	18.495562
then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture , and dropped into navy slang .	946.6321
`` take off , fly-boy ' ' ! !	1.0577899
he muttered , and took off , obviously feeling like a fool .	462.39093
the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy .	968.18475
it hadn ' t been this way in college , or in nurses ' training	795.13025
everybody had accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl .	541.2101
nobody had addressed her in broken english at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she wasn ' t american .	243.3683
there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama , brunettes with a moorish hint of the orient in their faces	5036.2305
there are beauties from the balkan states who are similarly endowed , and -- back in the blessed united states -- they were regarded simply as pretty women .	486.7308
now , having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , tommy was being humiliated at every turn .	734.59515
four little japanese waitresses were murdering the english language at the counter -- yuki kobayashi happened to be one of them .	2778.463
everybody but tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` bifutek-san ' ' ! !	253.13322
for a steak sandwich , or `` kohi futotsu ' ' ! !	512.66724
two other japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well groomed .	2246.8975
one was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander	904.55023
the other was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children .	1821.8407
seeing these did nothing for tommy ' s mood .	131.91765
she told herself rebelliously , and with pride , i am an american ! !	130.23343
and so she was , and would remain .	36.710697
but she was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the club , there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english .	587.4623
there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese .	1026.045
after coming to america , her parents had spoken only english .	612.3445
she had been sent to the wrong place for duty .	97.047035
there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward .	963.42194
one had to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours .	19324.945
now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar .	7229.8867
it was terribly off key , and poorly done , and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt lonesome and put-upon .	1870.4094
she finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check	295.10303
she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated .	158.07503
eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion .	26789.633
back in her living quarters at the hospital she took bicarbonate of soda , and sulked .	12448.717
then , after a while , she went to her mirror .	73.311
she certainly looked japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men .	146.89423
and , still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach .	137.1869
there was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful .	180.99304
she promised that she would soon take a few day ' s leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of oyajima -- which was not very far from yokosuka .	455.18207
and tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown .	697.04584
tommy , of course , had never heard of a kotowaza , or japanese proverb , which says , `` tanin yori miuchi ' ' , and is literally translated as `` relatives are better than strangers ' ' .	1917.8882
actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water .	1707.2162
doc doolittle ' s scheduled appearance at captain ' s mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report .	521.19366
but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual , too , and walt perry was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing .	1847.6897
just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn ' t know .	635.83307
in his opinion , doc had not grown up .	34.505875
the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief .	188.6796
there had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up .	22335.703
he had come into the navy too young , with the image of the fun-loving guns appleby before him .	2007.6086
the war found him much too early , and its perils -- and especially its awful boredom -- were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical jokes , and even now doc had never found any stabilizing , sobering influence .	3141.0784
he remained young at heart , with an overdeveloped sense of humor .	128.77985
he wisecracked about the captain ' s indoctrination of new men , took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches with ethyl chloride , and gave no thought for tomorrow .	3225.2107
he was doing thirty years , and the navy would take care of him .	133.49391
the job security enjoyed by doc doolittle , and nearly all members of the armed forces , is a wonderful thing .	67.66219
actually , all a man in uniform has to do is to get by .	310.00723
he may not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired .	213.64728
this deprived him of liberty in hong kong , but he told boats mccafferty that hong kong was a book he had read before , and the navy would always bring him there again , some day .	512.09186
at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the base because walt perry , being thoughtful , knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base .	966.20624
this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well .	404.69424
there were two things he wanted to do inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval base , and visit an old shipmate .	666.8225
a telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange .	468.79364
after supper , doc called whitey gresham , who was now a lieutenant and had a family .	154.09187
`` well , doc , you old sonofabitch ' ' ! !	10.272991
`` i ' ll be there , but i ' ll walk ' ' , doc said .	87.82767
`` i ' ve got to run an errand on the way .	753.4186
see you in about an hour ' ' .	1.9824034
he threw a smart salute at the gangway , went up the dock , and turned down the wide street in front of the petty officers ' club .	242.56808
how , he wondered , does one enjoy one ' s spare time ? ?	67.08928
he considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk .	1025.3877
then there was exercise , boating and hiking , which was not only good for you but also made you more virile the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted .	424.57486
perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion -- but he ' d lost his clubs , hadn ' t played in years .	254.80602
there was swimming over at the riverside hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog .	420.08087
perhaps a packing trip into the sierras , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark .	1570.4839
i could , he thought , take a long walk -- but where ? ?	116.61565
`` you missed it ' ' , buzz ' s voice said , `` you should have gone over to the pagan room with us .	210.1844
strippers , but scrumptious , and toodle williams and her all-lesbian band ' ' .	565.87335
`` hi , buzz ' ' , owen said .	3.9996958
`` i went over to the willows and dropped two notes ' ' .	282.09338
`` tough ' ' , buzz said , `` listen , we ' re having a stag dinner over at the pagan room on friday .	225.14317
imagine a stag dinner with toodle williams ' ' .	2.2701306
owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn ' t come to reno for stag dinners .	1064.8723
`` thanks ' ' , owen said , `` but friday is a long way off and anything can happen ' ' .	173.92822
buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest .	773.55975
when owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door .	367.75076
`` yes ' ' , owen called out .	23.994171
`` i ' m mrs . gertrude parker ' ' , a soft voice explained , `` and i ' d like to talk to you for a few minutes , please ' ' .	67.24682
ahah , he thought , a lush divorcee at last .	124.65959
he was disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door .	439.9566
she frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons .	33737.457
`` how do you do ' ' ? ?	1.0292817
`` our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in alaska .	2392.8662
we call them lay-sisters and they go among the eskimos making friends and bringing the light .	2596.846
they ' re up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them ' ' .	111.28132
`` you see ' ' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light , `` you and i can ' t understand the many hardships they have to undergo ' ' .	633.95154
she apparently wasn ' t satisfied with his reaction .	574.10034
smug , owen thought , smug and sappy .	18.895893
there was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye .	289.90125
it gave her a lewd , winking effect .	7.141644
`` have you ever tried to reason with an eskimo ' ' ? ?	88.60764
`` they are a very difficult group of people ' ' .	33.64742
`` i don ' t know much about them ' ' , owen admitted , `` but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do ' ' .	207.2494
`` you know , that ' s very interesting .	79.29527
people don ' t know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that .	1292.1976
the more canvassing i do , the more i note how far most people are from their personal god ' ' .	390.2198
that she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ? ?	149.84488
several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice .	555.45416
`` how did you get by the desk ' ' ? ?	7.746552
`` i ' m sure the hotel doesn ' t know you ' re wandering around the corridors , knocking on strangers ' doors and talking down eskimos ' ' .	916.63837
`` oh , i just come once a week .	90.61407
i do this work all on my own , because i understand the difficulties and i want to help these lay-sisters .	345.2235
do you know these women go all through alaska , and they don ' t have the proper facilities ? ?	47.223953
they travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day ' ' .	590.8692
`` do you have any idea how far i travel every day ? ?	289.28278
i have the whole pacific northwest ' ' .	2.323122
owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn ' t help himself .	48.68553
`` that ' s hardly a christian approach ' ' , she remonstrated .	229.59216
`` you ' re in the secular world ' ' .	3.8016384
`` i didn ' t say it was christian .	3395.457
i don ' t think you ' ll find many active christian salesmen .	2581.8162
those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses , but they don ' t get top personnel .	153.22728
our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics ' ' .	8.119372
`` god , i take it , plays no part in this ' ' , she said waspishly .	349.96957
`` god doesn ' t have any appliance or cosmetics ' ' , he said heatedly before he caught himself .	645.214
he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation .	1356.2368
`` and whiskey ' ' , she said , smiling and blinking at the highball glasses .	4821.874
it ' s such a big seller ' ' .	3.0222654
`` you know ' ' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` i think you ' re going to have to excuse me .	93.131714
`` i can imagine ' ' , she said .	7.853841
but what do you want to do about the lay-sisters ? ?	1157.8933
can ' t you help them ' ' ? ?	2.5026464
`` i have no card ' ' , she said bitterly .	624.3763
`` you haven ' t been listening to what i ' ve been telling you .	143.0224
i only hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual bucking-up ' ' .	402.08694
she looked crestfallen , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race .	732.5813
she stood indecisively for a moment , then walked down the hall	236.18442
it took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself	4105.8086
he showered , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast .	57.08342
on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail .	432.72202
there was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued .	1439.0432
his lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there was a letter from the collector of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year ' s exemptions .	446.6806
he ate breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto virginia street , he felt braced .	389.69485
the glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle .	5645.8857
with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot .	7304.5845
although it was only three o ' clock , he stopped in at the golden calf .	103.06337
the tables were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded .	518.32935
just to test himself , he played roulette for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars .	408.8575
when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach .	1567.8768
the golden calf was dimly lit with shaded neon .	455.94476
there were more women than men in the place , but he couldn ' t find a flowerpot .	234.97516
they all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up .	2360.078
the mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons , who appeared much more animated than the gamblers .	1043.1416
the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful .	551.95264
all , of course , except the donner party who were bent on starving to death .	808.8033
`` i wonder if they did eat each other at the end ' ' , owen mused .	500.32986
he sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes .	102.36968
owen was surprised to see mrs . gertrude parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance .	3014.7683
she sat down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical devices , and owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support .	1916.7499
a dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde ' s place .	67.831474
he was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables .	3694.0598
`` what you need is a steady martingale ' ' , the cowboy announced after watching owen play .	505.12952
`` you can ' t build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen ' ' .	8904.03
`` what are you playing ' ' ? ?	1.0473369
`` i ' m just logging ' ' , the cowboy explained .	123.33395
`` i keep all these plays in this little black book , and i watch over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers are repeating .	720.8231
i ' m always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack .	45784.938
incidentally , i ' m pretty famous in these parts i ' m called the wrangler ' ' .	169.10887
don ' t you have to spend any time on your ranch ' ' ? ?	44.437576
i ' m with the bar-h , pushing a horse called sparky .	6098.4897
he ' s my own horse , and what i collect from him i use on blackjack .	2211.9783
this sparky can rack and single-foot and he ' s the fastest thing in washoe county .	950.323
i figure if i can get any kind of publicity campaign going , i ' ll land him on tv -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some western hero .	606.5235
i once trained a horse for hoot gibson , but nothing like sparky .	2200.6604
he ' s a pinto and he photographs wonderfully ' ' .	312.16794
five came up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars .	378.0059
this proved conclusively that the wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to hurrays , an even more glorified gambling den than the golden calf .	3131.737
he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays featured as an added attraction .	119.137825
he ogled a long redhead with green eyes , but she was a shill with her money in front of her .	203.78406
the management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points .	666.33905
he read a special announcement whereby hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three a . m . starring adele ( the body ) brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls .	8838.707
he wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him .	142.46045
he passed two brides , both wearing orchids , and they made him feel a little sad .	210.21336
buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses .	7828.846
he was shorter and fatter than owen , who felt good standing next to him .	368.38663
`` we ' re all going over to lake tahoe and try our luck at cal-neva ' ' , buzz explained , still instigating .	3671.764
`` we ran into a guy at the pagan room who guarantees we can beat the wheel .	6494.515
he started out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the club found him crossroading .	6621.383
he was knocking down checks at faro ' ' .	1.9903312
`` i ' m allergic to tahoe ' ' , owen explained .	295.7427
`` well , okay ' ' , buzz said .	12.148654
`` we ' ll see you around later ' ' .	3.3518913
owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot , but he couldn ' t pyramid with any consecutive success .	657.925
`` how ' s your luck , honey ' ' ? ?	4.622274
a short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him .	1302.4486
she looked well-fed and prosperous , but he didn ' t get the impression he was being propositioned the way he ' d been hoping .	320.3637
`` i haven ' t had any luck since i was a baby ' ' .	47.386513
`` stake me ' ' , she said , `` and let me at those dice .	180.26947
i ' ll make them dance the tango .	7.5908017
we ' ll get it in a hurry and get it out ' ' .	35.880127
`` let ' s have a drink and discuss a merger ' ' .	509.8456
`` if you go broke ' ' , she said , smiling up at him , `` i ' ll leave you ' ' .	71.54247
`` sounds like real love ' ' , owen said .	665.9871
`` it sort of brings a lump to my throat ' ' .	75.030945
`` my name ' s gisele ' ' , the blonde said after she ordered a scotch .	531.4667
my mother wanted to call me sylphide , but it sounded too affected ' ' .	83.04412
`` is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense ' ' ? ?	90.585594
alexander said , `` answer me properly , spencer ' ' .	192.20207
spencer was quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` there is nothing i want to say , captain ' ' .	43.22555
naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor .	382.17987
philip spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address .	261.5277
during the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers .	700.99695
those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so as to be near spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him .	1123.2195
the two met in the captain ' s cabin .	557.7933
`` what is the next step , captain ' ' ? ?	10.830022
`` more arrests , i fear ' ' .	3.0884326
in your opinion , who is this e . andrews on the ' certain ' list ' ' ? ?	633.62427
he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot .	215.00232
he saw the dangers , not the glories of being identified as a mutineer .	241.2891
somehow he talked spencer into letting him use another name ' ' .	57.490814
there was a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished to see the captain .	1466.2439
heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places .	10920.865
`` and also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely .	1729.85
an african knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley and green .	1233.773
mckinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into spencer ' s possession and that ' ' --	159.23402
`` where did you gather all this information , heiser ? ?	2359.7876
who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who ' ' --	816.5843
he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with gansevoort and heiser behind him .	2686.121
a glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away .	151.89537
the aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained , well-organized crew struck alexander with horror .	8473.086
he bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction .	921.28186
adrien deslonde hastened to alexander ' s side .	11.197365
`` small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast .	882.3825
i saw him myself and it was done after consultation with cromwell .	317.85938
and it was clear that adrien was not mistaken , for both small and cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer had given the signal to obey .	3413.2258
then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work .	50.724224
alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed .	950.5229
their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by philip spencer ' s unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated .	951.7243
when the mast was raised , alexander gave the order for small and cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers .	2536.268
spencer ' s potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal .	2839.1882
tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by wilson , brandishing the weapon .	894.5795
wilson , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green , mckee and mckinley .	919.2414
not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny .	630.69635
in the tiny cabin , alexander met with gansevoort , heiser and wales to speak and to listen .	2661.2886
three days had passed since spencer ' s arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears .	865.7953
gansevoort said , `` it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely .	517.9839
to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed .	894.7378
from actions aboard , it is easy to guess that spencer ' s boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate ' ' .	1050.7072
`` well ' ' , heiser ventured , `` why don ' t we hold an investigation with questioning and ' ' --	140.06769
`` that would be worse than useless ' ' , alexander broke in .	788.54565
`` there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners .	1050.5002
besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? ?	249.46724
then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the united states , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order .	187.88737
mr . heiser , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? ?	125.39606
do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now ' ' ? ?	87.93738
wales said , `` of course they would .	1439.0178
they are about to do so at any moment as it is .	71.9463
all that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead .	409.9756
as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer , we are going to be rushed .	317.2298
we are going to be rushed and murdered ' ' .	11.982838
`` that is extravagant language , mr . wales .	351.35425
we are not going to be rushed and murdered ' ' , alexander said .	447.91702
`` we are going to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound ' ' .	366.5382
`` of course , i agree with the captain ' ' , gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate .	1464.2533
anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand ' ' .	51.340256
he paused , then added , `` everything on a ship is a weapon .	142.24074
implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands .	1718.8356
and we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many ' ' .	178.86334
`` we ourselves must stand sentinel ' ' .	2.6811664
`` under arms day and night , watch and watch about .	1323.8673
those of us present , the perry brothers , deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the somers .	1587.651
a great deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed ' ' .	162.24083
and when he was alone again in the cabin , alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done .	349.49298
with all his heart he had loved the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy ' s implacable laws .	344.63864
and when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the navy to which he had dedicated his soul .	307.39636
he who had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer .	2553.7273
it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven .	1185.6442
it was given or it was not given .	11.942668
one did one ' s best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward .	1619.6481
one did one ' s best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen-year-old boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one ' s ship .	2374.7498
and alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame .	163.48195
god knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist ' s rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career .	478.75992
another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist .	6967.438
it was for love that he had served the navy .	128.20671
to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for .	93.08872
yes , he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price .	412.77002
and after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity .	424.68115
stern-faced , he inspected the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason .	881.5275
the prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger .	657.55804
only cromwell , the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful .	9326.797
he said , `` captain , may i speak , please ? ?	179.7938
captain , i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship ' ' .	78.757164
`` are you , cromwell ' ' ? ?	1.1103417
i know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing ' ' .	28.25153
`` you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt ' ' .	25.530502
`` i cannot speak for others , sir , but i am innocent ' ' .	44.731163
he leaned closer to alexander , squinting up at him from the deck .	135.24144
`` surely , captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything ' ' .	292.60764
`` no , cromwell , i did not find your name .	302.92746
now spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke .	1539.0646
he said , `` cromwell is telling you the truth .	132.62878
the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell .	678.04114
alexander knew spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled .	16532.94
and in a sudden wave of painful clarity , alexander recognized a kinship with spencer .	3991.0818
here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable .	223.54614
there was good fortune and there was bad and philip spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth .	1029.452
he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .	6958.1084
the red-haired captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer .	934.03217
this tragic lad had forged his own shackles .	7.7491717
but he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him .	321.36676
and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired captain , they would be each other ' s undoing .	1105.8662
`` spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for cromwell to be innocent ? ?	144.21523
`` i tell you he is innocent ' ' .	1.7420447
`` and do you think there is a reason why i should accept your word ' ' ? ?	48.34166
i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell ' ' .	6.0381074
`` nothing to lose , either , spencer ' ' .	5.9706087
`` that ' s true ' ' , spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation .	2574.5566
his eyes went back to contemplation of the sea .	62.822216
`` i am innocent , captain ' ' , cromwell said again .	319.77182
`` before god , captain , i am innocent ' ' .	42.526608
and though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell .	1352.4976
no action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the greek paper , had seen it in cromwell ' s hands while spencer whispered explanations .	919.80707
`` i thought ' ' , midshipman rogers had told alexander , `` that spencer was teaching him geometry ' ' .	1231.6627
it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him .	4082.2224
this was a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized .	593.21405
some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were spencer ' s followers .	921.8483
rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the torah .	3350.5776
a young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides .	1057.6555
he wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles .	4147.1406
his black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high .	2084.7327
with his head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead .	834.3397
he had a pinkish-white complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled paot .	3601.353
i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .	3.7561164
the girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings .	2112.259
i turned and watched him stride down the center of the road .	58.280613
his hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and , pivoting on his heel , he entered an old stone building .	663.46405
rachel had seen me watching the young man .	29.753754
`` when your mother was here he must have been a young boy .	64.614784
like the ones you will see now ' ' .	1.7151155
i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside rachel .	6763.778
she led me into a twisting side alley .	3.2596824
the dirty , discolored buildings looked boarded up , and their few windows stood high above our heads .	650.8202
rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings .	38.205322
we entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor .	2078.2466
an old man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat , baggy trousers , and a black skullcap greeted us .	4148.5605
he nodded , clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch , and flicked glances at me .	3429.4324
i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were bare-armed , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor .	896.2161
he stopped in front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom .	381.82776
little boys crowded together on long wooden benches , and in the center of the room sat the teacher .	80.3169
his black beard dripped down over the front of his coat .	86.759674
one white hand poised a stick above his desk .	17.88382
he turned his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in yiddish , `` one , two , three ' ' ! !	293.13858
the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation or interpretation of the five books of moses , which they had previously chanted in hebrew .	470.65158
they chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick .	86.24466
each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe .	340.99658
they had large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces .	9375.981
they bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher .	249.75862
since they did not glance curiously at us once , i guessed that there was a penalty for distraction .	546.34534
the teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in hebrew , rapping the stick incessantly .	7003.932
one boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles .	2241.9797
his tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders .	6474.077
in the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap .	2633.4912
i stared at him for a long time .	16.523087
my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys .	557.8973
some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago .	1223.2625
they singsonged the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick .	2116.5085
the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake .	2112.9521
i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair .	115.93805
his body pitched back and forth on the bench .	73.63862
i shuddered and backed out of the room .	8.791918
rachel followed , looked at me , and clucked with her tongue .	5084.383
from behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer .	589.75653
i said , `` how long do they keep that up ' ' ? ?	51.697346
`` all day ' ' , she said .	11.01389
`` except for shabbat , when they are praying all day ' ' .	164.0718
they had turned numb and prickly in the classroom .	838.5188
the old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps .	71.643936
he glanced down into his beard and muttered something in yiddish .	8536.887
rachel said , `` he asks for money ' ' .	5.7843556
i reached into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin .	6109.772
then i picked it up again and handed it to the old man .	28.369423
`` does this bother you ' ' ? ?	1.043147
`` most of our sabras think it ' s horrible .	262.9521
when we were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass .	686.8382
they said that we must not fight but wait for the messiah ' ' .	194.72835
you had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home .	155.45891
you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal .	2477.8782
you had to know , also , that you were going to fail .	137.89317
all of it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place .	44.415947
she said , `` sometimes i think they are keeping religion for us while we play around .	903.2042
she wished to change much for the children here ' ' .	14.468056
i said quietly , respectfully , `` what did she do here ? ?	110.6236
but when she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the kibbutzim .	157.6865
she was a strange woman , your mother .	23.34408
when she loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved .	842.7047
nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted .	131.00145
for many immigrants , for many children , the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your mother .	332.68976
sometimes it was dangerous for her ' ' .	1.8878546
and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people .	591.6214
it was an impulse when she was here in me ' a she ' arim -- i was with her -- that led her to stay in israel .	621.3519
your mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave their ghettos .	214.97003
here they did not need to be in ghettos .	26231.17
if she could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms .	150.77895
she set out to make sure that no jewish child anyplace in the world had to live in a place such as this ' ' .	363.844
i said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be rebuffed , `` then why did she leave israel ? ?	301.47864
i ' d like to know that very much ' ' .	5.800228
rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace .	143.38657
the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones .	1265.58
she pursed her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that i thought she was angry with me .	270.37738
she had good friends here , people who liked her .	1118.1914
but she had to go out and hurt herself .	573.3674
he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted .	127.09076
there was a refugee who was able to come here because of her .	174.9556
at first i thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so .	74.50178
this refugee was a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen .	631.66095
he had the black numerals on his arm , so he had been branded in a concentration camp .	404.71298
often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one .	74.72588
then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of europe .	72.368576
all his family was dead , except for his son .	107.78917
your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off , and she would send him home to his son .	204.76924
he loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him .	68.783356
then his son did something ' ' -- rachel threw up her hands -- `` i don ' t know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the mandate -- and the son was imprisoned .	225.31448
a few hours after the son was arrested , your mother was informed .	202.88605
she ran from a little group of us .	5.755212
she went to the father and found he had hanged himself ' ' .	64.75265
then she continued with energy , `` i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father .	215.48154
no one saw her except the man reuveni ' ' .	3.296166
rachel gave me a direct , bright-eyed look .	11.441091
she said , `` reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee .	664.44934
he complained to me once that i must talk to her .	238.12527
when i did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him .	1221.7888
i asked her if she would , and she said she would not .	49.80475
he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him .	126.07047
anyway , i did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself .	572.54205
and she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted his proposal .	421.97906
he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn ' t understand why she had upset herself .	379.4986
but now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her .	174.29477
he would never let her harm herself again .	6.393233
for one whole week he never let her stay alone .	215.57578
he took her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was .	294.05194
reuveni took her with him wherever he went .	9.737417
he did not let her choose her own food .	280.72696
`` and i ' ll take you with me ' ' .	4.308007
for when he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too .	251.48439
`` what did i imagine ' ' ? ?	1.0324336
`` did i see him about to swing low in a chariot ? ?	1157.2067
or maybe poling up the south fork of the forked deer river braving the wastes dumped in it ? ?	19891.531
maybe i saw him on a barge with a gang of ethiopians poling it ' ' .	3960.1665
and i ' ll take you with me .	4.03314
out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect highway patrol with feelers waving .	2510.9055
and the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened .	459.29645
and gratt shafer would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along .	755.5671
like mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and toonker burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would .	5854.1094
just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen .	484.6659
or you could hope the parachute wouldn ' t open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to starkey poe in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice `` i think i ' m pregnant ' ' .	532.3112
or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill gratt shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night .	1587.3234
so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help .	351.13535
and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won ' t tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too .	599.4327
it is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull .	5892.0225
and most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one .	885.71106
he can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even houdini couldn ' t figure out , how it is unlocked .	2337.8657
and he can be on the way to memphis , your gratt shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead .	1054.7078
because if you can ' t then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him .	435.21555
for you don ' t share him , not even with god .	192.08131
if it is love , you don ' t .	6.0936646
and i ' ll take you with me .	3.899528
even if that ' s all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie .	205.40068
even when he is on the way to memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you .	566.437
and in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart .	198.06158
you feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn ' t particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn ' t .	297.87567
and you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn ' t get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn ' t afford and the too-shiny shoes .	319.83707
you think `` did he feel that way about me ' ' ? ?	13.398625
it comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn ' t have gratt shafer	815.4434
that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy .	424.0009
it dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because gratt shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to gratt shafer ' s substitute , that other guy .	1655.0591
and you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to st . louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success .	267.02106
you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you .	419.39798
you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn ' t be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you .	146.40625
`` damn the world ' ' , she thought .	167.5141
she looked out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence bordering the grounds .	999.3423
homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments .	496.1272
the bands were impatient , but they were the only ones .	30.876608
the others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city .	528.097
it was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing .	4420.7593
he was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the united states some day .	78.71079
so they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling .	202.6514
if a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever .	109.67032
you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too .	234.15106
it was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it .	349.49948
you laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm .	1591.7505
he hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought .	93.2339
while he talked you wouldn ' t trade being a west tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it hadn ' t , in six weeks , rained enough to wet a rat ' s ass .	782.4278
she glanced at the man nodding beside her , a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks , with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen , reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in august -- yes , with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only june , only festival time again and thoughts of gratt shafer would not leave her .	3166.5415
`` i should have stayed at the store ' ' , she thought .	38.86626
back at the factory-to-you with the other old maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down .	593.4599
there was no lock because herman didn ' t allow a lock .	117.706665
a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping .	3680.1458
the toilet hadn ' t had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place because you couldn ' t keep the public out -- entirely .	531.1601
she could not count the times herman had rapped on the door , just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall .	1156.4934
the two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot .	1179.0653
and the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on saturdays and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn ' t smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor .	494.156
among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs .	6075.728
each of us had his own specialty besides .	7.738076
george did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight-by-ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler ' s glass .	1358.4121
he also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic journals , the new yorker , for instance , or esquire .	399.72964
i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver .	11789.222
the book could be the brothers karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration .	540.07007
the book was a fine historical novel about edward 3 , , and i did a week of research to get the details just right the fifteenth-century armor , furnishings , clothes .	1340.1134
i even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made -- linden wood covered with leather -- so i ' d get the light reflections accurate .	3108.1365
mckenzie , the art editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` nothing doing , rufus .	1978.7997
in the first place , it ' s static	16867.305
in the second place , it doesn ' t look authentic	1397.3048
and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- you ' ve got six colors there including gold ' ' .	235.59445
i said , `` mr . mckenzie , it is as authentic as careful research can make it ' ' .	181.25371
he said , `` that may be , but it isn ' t authentic the way readers think .	390.69177
they know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little lord fauntleroy , and only the villains had beards .	3053.364
and girls couldn ' t have dressed like that -- it isn ' t transparent enough ' ' .	81.99507
in the end , i did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie .	837.1473
`` that ' s authenticity ' ' , he said .	7.748235
as for donald , he actually sold paintings .	18.4648
we all painted in our spare time , and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it .	274.80853
he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to joyce monmouth or her friends .	1824.2009
he had style , a real inner vision of his very own .	202.0941
it was strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults .	223.9501
there was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye .	286.324
we used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted .	1529.3247
it may have been true for all i know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it didn ' t prevent the paintings from being exciting .	203.15091
he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` for christ ' s sake , donald , you ' ve got prussian blue all over your shirt ' ' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well .	302.33926
mrs . monmouth thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting .	180.12563
it was all gravy , and donald didn ' t need much to live on	41.703114
we shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another .	1059.0948
attending the life class was my idea -- or rather , askington ' s idea , but i was ripe for it , and the other two wouldn ' t have gone if i hadn ' t talked them into it .	187.49698
i hadn ' t done a serious picture in almost a year .	60.232998
it wasn ' t just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse i often used , even to myself .	279.12186
it was the kind of work i was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting .	464.8027
i kept saying , `` if i could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an illustrator -- like peter askington , for instance -- then i could take some time off and paint ' ' .	374.79196
askington was a kind of goal i set myself	13730.138
i had admired him long before i talked to him .	37.29483
it looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income .	312.19965
the night we first met , at one of mrs . monmouth ' s giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt	2831.6116
instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade .	6078.69
this set his tone richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the brush-off ' s rent for a year .	367.34625
he was fifteen years older than i -- forty-four -- but full of spring and sparkle .	1463.722
he didn ' t look like what i thought of as an old man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger .	450.2503
he was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in america	35218.0
you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month .	884.85156
life had included him in its `` modern american artists ' ' series and had photographed him at his studio in the east sixties	248.13554
the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty of spain .	726.45276
we went into mrs . monmouth ' s library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a modigliani portrait , a jackson pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background , that looked like an inscription from a martian tomb .	1023.63434
the fireplace had tiles made for mrs . monmouth by picasso himself .	44359.652
like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself .	795.47876
in the course of our talk , askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying .	1232.3401
`` no , i take classes with different people ' ' , he said .	27.05609
`` i don ' t think i ' ve reached the point , yet , where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft .	132.87903
besides , it ' s important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters , as durer went to italy to meet bellini and mantegna ' ' .	412.72162
he made a circle with his thumb and fingers .	202.35493
`` painting isn ' t this big , you know .	38.497986
it doesn ' t embrace only the artist , alone before his easel .	1092.4906
it is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous ' ' .	248.89381
he threw his arms wide , his face shining .	6710.982
`` the artist is like a fragment of a mosaic -- no , he is more than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic .	394.72488
one of these days , i ' m going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that ' s being painted these days , from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism , and then you ' ll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other .	661.2674
the eye is all , inward or outward .	17.361887
ah , what a title for the exhibition the eye is all ' ' ! !	150.42575
`` what do you study ' ' ? ?	1.0744385
just listening to him made me feel intelligent .	3.8715408
`` i ' m studying anatomy with burns ' ' , he replied .	21.088127
he teaches at the manhattan school of art ' ' .	3.6523013
i had studied with burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me , along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on hudson street .	1206.2131
burns and i had not loved each other .	18.385473
`` i ' m also studying enameling with hajime iijima ' ' , he went on , `` and twice a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton ' ' .	597.20337
`` my god , is he still alive ? ?	12.760458
i went to a retrospective of his work when i was eighteen , and i thought he was a contemporary of cezanne ' s ' ' .	96.31017
`` he ' s about sixty , now .	83.328804
still painting , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms .	627.8183
he even makes the city look like one of thoreau ' s hangouts .	4259.321
i ' ve always admired him , and when i heard he was taking a few pupils , i went to him and joined his class ' ' .	111.048935
`` yes , it sounds great ' ' , i said , `` but suppose you don ' t think of yourself as an impressionist painter ' ' ? ?	49.875538
`` you ' re missing the point ' ' , he said .	6.347033
and that ' s the trouble with so many artists today .	261.32602
they sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life .	699.7993
that ' s one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation .	724.71967
in the middle ages , in the renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world .	84.23455
he was an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did .	4038.2046
he filled a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses .	1482.8575
he was a propagandist -- they weren ' t afraid of the word , then -- satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party .	466.37476
we hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity .	2375.1724
what we need is to get back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school ' ' .	138.87314
the upshot of the evening was that i got the address of pendleton ' s studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn ' t work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning .	238.03569
it was an awkward hour , but i didn ' t have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job .	225.19902
after a short time , both george and donald joined the class with me so they wouldn ' t feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the brush-off reading out to work .	394.89505
it was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .	2525.5803
`` stimulating ' ' was the word for it .	58.1184
i don ' t know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it to be .	270.68015
partly , it was because pendleton himself wasn ' t what i anticipated .	100.32243
i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars .	602.1307
no , that isn ' t quite fair .	9.409209
actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week .	550.7131
such a little thing to start with -- the car registration .	449.75742
`` ida , where is the car license ' ' ? ?	10.551137
`` i can ' t find it in the glove compartment ' ' .	82.27746
`` via must have it ' ' , i answered readily enough , recalling her last visit .	1408.4338
`` via ' ' , she was frowning .	8.557037
`` why should via have it ' ' ? ?	5.8861356
had she forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children ? ?	428.25305
i didn ' t want to stir things up .	53.272015
`` i drive my own car by courtesy of via ' ' ? ?	137.71373
`` i ' m sure she ' d turn it over to you , if you ' d rather .	178.98364
she looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud .	1165.3799
`` she must have taken the registration when she went to walter ' s .	112.667076
i want nothing of via ' s ' ' .	2.5874977
walter was giving me checks for my pay , the household bills .	188.59756
had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind ? ?	346.74426
`` what a fool i ' ve been ' ' , she said quietly .	73.93797
`` i knew all this , but i paid no attention .	179.63167
i don ' t even own the house i ' m standing in .	268.57138
i was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things	537.5766
`` it narrows down down down and finally there is no way out .	75.83327
if i am not to be mrs . salter i am nothing ' ' .	503.5728
i suppose i should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in .	2893.145
i love you , i hate you , i feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence i love you i think you ' re the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living .	450.2666
i made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .	1671.8939
`` don ' t bother , ida ' ' , she said .	10.886499
`` i have these appointments in town for saturday , and i ' ll probably spend sunday with dolly or the thaxters ' ' .	673.20996
at last , i thought , she ' s recovering her spirits .	1821.2015
with this movie-to-be in london , and new faces about her there , she would soon be a more tranquil , a wiser person , all the better for her stay out here .	413.4311
i felt more cheerful , as if i had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself .	436.9802
and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life .	139.97255
it was foggy that evening , but the path to my house was so well grooved that i could feel my way , accustomed as i was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river and sometimes last for days .	982.213
in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on .	1178.6321
i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the fog i assumed mrs . salter had done the same before she left for town .	343.54556
i did my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from there i went to the women ' s lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual christmas bazaar , so that dusk was beginning to gather when i drove home in the late afternoon .	648.47174
why , when i drove down to church , didn ' t it speak to me , seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear ? ?	267.899
prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , unsee .	949.94476
when i came back from church at noon mrs . thaxter was turning into the salter driveway .	7920.5483
even at a car ' s length i could sense that something was wrong , and so i followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house .	163.8925
dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us .	924.08405
`` she ' s nowhere , nowhere ' ' ! !	2.7185805
she screamed , and both women ran up to the house , and i followed .	38.074364
the search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening closets , talking , exclaiming in rushes and gasps .	6253.8257
everything was as i had left it the night before last -- her portfolio and bag for town , her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing .	2708.675
i , who until that day before had been mrs . salter ' s friend , her equal , was the servant now .	364.10867
it was dolly and mrs . thaxter who were calling via , everybody .	3714.9675
and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me .	53.321266
and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait .	136.02588
sitting in the kitchen i recalled every word mrs . salter said that could have been a sign to me .	104.39511
`` if i am not to be mrs . salter then i am nothing ' ' .	205.59598
why didn ' t that alarm me then ? ?	145.82115
and when she returned from taking her guests back to new york she had said , `` all they talked about was harvie harvie this , harvie that when they know the truth will they drop away from me , will i become a nothing ' ' ? ?	858.97406
and then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to rome i had heard her boast , over and over again , `` on the boat people liked me for myself ' ' .	197.29872
i had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check .	447.13367
the last night i had called , but the line was always busy and it reassured me .	355.3337
i assumed it was one of those hour-long conversations with dolly or constance , she comfortable in bed .	7978.058
but it seemed not from what they were saying .	70.18368
then was it a final desperate plea from her , to whom ? ?	86.98319
hanging on and on past any man ' s patience some final stab of conclusion ? ?	3712.311
she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff .	42.783257
i tried to believe that what must have happened was that , restless , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing .	295.26657
sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff .	237.80608
it ' s so romantic up there , she used to say , with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic .	819.9613
with all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock , a misstep .	587.21387
but i didn ' t really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else .	305.59564
when a fisherman brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , i began to shudder with a terrible excitement , almost triumphant , that i still cannot account for .	730.49744
was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks ? ?	1361.3359
that at last the vigilance , the will gives way ? ?	218.86401
or what was it that , before via , sonny , walter and all , i began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out , `` i knew she ' d do it ! !	538.39825
their eyes turned cold and accusing , even via ' s .	733.3359
at the same time that i thought i understood her at long last and pitied her , underneath this knowing had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate , an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry ? ?	4741.3354
was that what had given way in me ? ?	5.0373325
even now i am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are .	436.2954
it is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own , but there it hangs , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other .	1134.6484
at the time i was filled with self-pity at this separation , but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry .	363.1055
in my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that i could have prevented it , i can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne .	419.49576
it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so coolly and walk away , that it hurts .	152.14894
i could tell them , but no one ever asked , why i had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body .	426.7967
no , i forget mrs . mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened .	545.09424
she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised mrs . salter to return to the country .	219.6694
`` we all feel guilty ' ' , i turned away from her coldly .	614.45856
`` what do you mean ' ' ? ?	1.0138935
`` why put such a high value on being top dog ' ' ? ?	249.78171
it was coarse , almost insulting , this harsh appraisal , and she has never come to see me since .	280.63217
but suppose she had not taken mrs . mathias ' advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , dispossessed of love , hanging on to makeshifts , and altogether and finally arid .	2012.5592
if she chose , and in that final decision discarded , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have risen to her fullest height , and transcending her murky self , felt at last the passion of a great moral decision ? ?	598.4091
if they say i could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination , her search into herself and its conclusions .	672.25146
yes , i had cried out that i knew she ' d do it , but without my fully realizing it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed -- and guilt .	513.40063
she was finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice .	736.7241
at rest with my darling ellen , the first mrs . salter .	1327.3192
the funeral service was in the house , the methodist minister , how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside , a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words , and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment , seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed .	2003.3083
then via called to say they had decided to cremate her -- as they had ellen , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did i want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning .	285.04184
the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor , on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses i had ordered .	3120.8162
i knelt , just for decency i thought at the time , but found myself whispering , `` our father which art in heaven ' ' and it was only after that that something unlocked in me and i felt a grief .	237.58766
via was in the parking lot when i went outside .	206.70036
together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey .	692.52655
by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths .	3258.464
again i felt impelled to kneel , and reached back and pulled via down .	1088.7546
something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing .	1206.2787
`` i had a rather small place of my own .	40.121025
a nice bachelor apartment in a place called the lancaster arms ' ' .	868.0432
`` uhhu ' ' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid .	8631.416
`` and then i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio ' ' .	107.20278
`` i ' m not a man who has many close intimate friends , carla ' ' , he said , wanting her to know all about him .	282.4832
`` oh , i ' d drink with newspaper people .	5133.495
i think i was what you might call a convivial man , and yet it was when i was alone in my studio , doing my work , that i really felt alive .	239.43785
but i think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with ' ' .	427.35184
pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question .	74.76277
she showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little .	217.89787
`` well , what about you , carla ' ' ? ?	4.161874
`` did you make friends easily ' ' ? ?	6.0893435
`` somehow i imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot .	382.47742
`` i guess so ' ' , she said taking a kleenex from her purse .	847.3288
when she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth , she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror .	251.18825
`` are your people still alive ' ' ? ?	3.1319532
he asked , trying to touch a part of her life alberto hadn ' t discussed	6210.125
so he could have something of her for himself .	67.88123
`` you talk so well , carla ' ' , he went on .	29.45746
`` you seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words ' ' , he added , trying to flatter her vanity .	445.24988
`` you must have been good at history at school .	87.46787
where did you go to school ' ' ? ?	4.170853
`` don ' t you know all about me by this time ? ?	76.10179
you know something more about me every day , don ' t you ? ?	22.110886
would you be happier if i made up some stories about my life , told you some lies ? ?	713.0513
why are you trying to worry me ' ' ? ?	2.2779083
`` i ' m not trying to worry you ' ' .	9.767398
`` well , all right then ' ' .	1.7564406
the cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing .	171.62787
at home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance .	160.57079
was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? ?	233.99625
would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around ? ?	338.8614
he straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid .	6115.636
if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too .	223.28961
`` what ' s the matter ' ' ? ?	8.015105
nothing at all ' ' , he said quietly .	4006.653
`` are those the only shoes you have , sam ' ' ? ?	283.82812
`` what ' s the matter with them ' ' ? ?	7.1948533
`` they ' re an expensive english shoe for walking around a lot .	253.06673
`` sam , no one around here wears such heavy soles .	17378.201
can ' t you get another pair ' ' ? ?	4.5610247
`` maybe i could ' ' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him .	167.21475
`` i ' ll get an elegant pair of thin-soled italian shoes tomorrow , carla ' ' .	3838.5632
`` and i don ' t know why you want to go on wearing that outfit ' ' , she said , making a face .	145.84709
`` what ' s the matter with it ' ' ? ?	6.0017114
he had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had encountered her on the street .	1991.8761
can ' t you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged ' ' ? ?	162.30142
`` i don ' t mind at all ' ' , he said , delighted with her attention .	47.91636
changing his clothes , he put on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good .	939.5435
but it was a hopeful sign , he told himself .	134.78235
she no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in parioli .	784.8582
that day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city .	51.95115
they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower via veneto , then they went to the farnese gardens .	1315.3248
she had some amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days .	67.89198
`` there ' s a church you should see ' ' , she said .	20.397003
and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at santa maria he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with alberto .	1152.1957
he let her tell him all about the church .	169.84354
all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself .	501.40033
when they got home at midnight she was tired out .	107.074554
and in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing .	1514.1809
he had never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps .	179.0802
it was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought .	160.93742
she might like to take him to st . peter ' s .	13.963296
`` carla , wake up ' ' , he said shaking her .	312.18802
aren ' t you going out to mass ? ?	10.878469
you could take me to st . peter ' s ' ' .	6.509134
`` come on , you ' ll be late ' ' .	49.306072
`` i think i ' ll sleep in this morning ' ' , she said drowsily , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went to church .	365.068
why did he want her to go to church ? ?	73.88802
he wondered probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security .	146.0854
it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church .	207.62854
she would have been better off if she had stuck to her bible .	358.71762
as for himself , he just didn ' t have the temperament for it .	52.214745
from the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know .	238.15935
then he thought of those old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel .	429.1476
could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now ? ?	4701.478
being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church .	535.2357
it was too bad he wasn ' t a catholic himself .	517.8673
or a protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists , or a strict orthodox communist .	12370.146
what was the matter with him that they all wearied him ? ?	3214.2668
it was the times , he was sure .	70.65458
all the ideologies changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom ? ?	177.44681
just the same , he thought , pondering over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she got up and went to church .	159.3934
a half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass .	638.2261
it seemed to him that if the ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with carla .	402.27087
`` since we ' re having coffee with them this afternoon ' ' , he said , `` i think i ' ll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us ' ' .	91.85185
and he waited for her to say , `` oh , no , i can do it , sam .	151.68344
there ' s so little to do ' ' .	1.6967589
`` i ' m not good at that kind of thing ' ' .	81.04962
`` this afternoon let ' s take an air with them .	338.05814
let ' s be fine superior people of great dignity ' ' , he said as if he were joking .	295.9697
`` if you find it necessary , sam , go ahead ' ' , she said , turning on the stair .	137.33588
her words remained with him , worrying him for hours .	174.34108
he didn ' t know how she would behave with other people .	143.8694
when they walked into the ferraro apartment , the old lady , bowing and smiling , said softly .	932.3435
`` ciao , ' ' and put out her hand .	64.33814
her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes gleamed , and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things .	2039.8716
agnese , smiling too , said , `` ' ello ' ' , and then more slowly , `` i am happy ' ' .	137.00536
and they sat down and began their little coffee party .	1274.2992
the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee .	11.116921
acting only as interpreter carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal .	1164.0581
she would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again .	87.84677
watching her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth .	124.36688
signora ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked sam about canada , having a special interest .	1160.2776
the old woman had a nephew from north italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrated to canada to work on the railway .	495.9593
for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar .	519.3293
did many of sam ' s countrymen live in boxcars in the bush ? ?	1104.8601
had sam ever lived in a boxcar ? ?	2.046874
regretfully sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars .	40639.527
just the same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country .	448.43124
and sam thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the pope .	330.59305
a very great pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes sparkling .	1214.2003
it was said that he had had a vision .	1480.169
just as thousands that day in portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to agnese for confirmation .	258.52075
agnese had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware .	135.8793
now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes .	1148.3518
the holy father would die soon , she said to carla , so she could translate for sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world .	269.2686
yes , the pope could die and quickly be made a saint .	364.85013
no , he was indeed a saint now .	104.58434
nodding approvingly and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered confidentially .	7407.3477
there was a certain discontent among the cardinals .	21.866373
the pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a little .	726.16907
there would be changes made , and signor raymond should understand that when the pope died it was like the end of a regime in rome .	361.77527
jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent .	2303.9937
indeed he did , sam said solemnly , trying to get carla ' s eye .	325.24936
surely she could see that these women were her italians , too , he thought .	197.3421
devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or malta or ireland .	4517.0835
but carla ' s eyes were on agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness .	907.93427
and carla , watching in wonder , turned to sam .	2811.6917
it ' s like a flame , i guess ' ' , she said in a dreamy tone .	98.52671
but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women ' s lodge , where shades of night had gone to purify herself .	537.51886
with the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill caressing the flageolet with his lips , making it whisper .	2096.321
he saw her emerge suddenly , coming in her unhesitant fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach .	1055.7181
in her dark , scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding .	352.2445
seeing her come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart bounce in him , and turned away , afraid now .	196.81943
even he , wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil presences in her metabolism more .	2424.2668
his breath caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off .	135.61082
going , he saw as often before some queer , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs .	1749.0128
he cried out to her , his back turned .	353.01025
then he fled , not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry .	1177.8483
yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp .	147.52415
elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small , curious clusters .	7940.8936
early spring came from her bed , from beside her half-drunk husband , walitzee , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion , the sound of hushed voices .	3008.1912
standing there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her .	1821.6697
when at last she could suffer the insult no longer , nor face the girl ' s scorn , she said in a voice overloud	731.3994
go back where you can bring no harm , or i will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame ' ' ! !	82.77782
but the girl said only , `` tell him i am here , that i have come ' ' .	31.67362
and it was not pile of clouds she meant .	757.7467
but now with real anger at last , something proud and indignant , early spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried , `` i will not shriek at you ! !	1382.091
i will tell you to go , not begging .	27858.67
and unsheathing the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side .	611.4968
`` you bring only wickedness ' ' , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal .	351.34854
speaking in a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife .	276.29233
`` go take helsq ' iyokom , your evil spirit , to the young boys ' ' , the woman said .	142.11803
`` they do not have to face battle .	6.0995536
the other women had come close now , their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats mingling , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt .	2581.9258
they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl .	180.87814
the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs .	2092.069
they were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought .	135.22041
but she did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them , swinging a great bullhide whip .	3325.5686
`` go back to your lodges ' ' ! !	15.220288
`` a pack of dogs makes less noise ' ' ! !	11.899504
he made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some tripping over themselves in their flight .	865.6578
`` if you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter .	199.68793
drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband ' ' ! !	107.530846
but the old man turned on her , jerking the whip from her hand .	3505.4094
`` get into your hovel ' ' ! !	1.0526091
`` go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women .	1633.8789
keep him back , if you must tell me what to do .	99.58393
i will be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin ' ' ! !	165.90706
she retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where walitzee stirred , mumbling , sitting up in a half stupor to say	2362.4978
i thought i dreamed of wolves fighting ' ' .	1.2660679
but she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness , smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from tuhulhulzote .	2385.865
she said , `` there is nothing that concerns you here .	815.1728
do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain ' ' .	43.704685
he sank back , sighing , and was soon asleep again .	2875.3074
outside , the old man , beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms .	1143.6266
and , shoving her against a spruce , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air , shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked , settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged , as dark and motionless as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face .	1112.9199
she said to him , her father , `` how was i begotten , in pain or joy ? ?	509.13885
is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me ? ?	452.53915
they all know your foolish name ' ' ! !	17.053646
she stared at the pale tracings on the tree , hearing her breath refracted from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark .	927.95874
she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables words which had no meaning , like , `` unnnt ! !	4764.902
the sounds of an animal in rage and despair .	191.25029
suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high , quavering voice	2576.405
`` did you follow me to see my shame ? ?	169.37607
move from the line or i will settle the whip on you .	709.86945
do you hear the anger of the whip ' s whine ' ' ? ?	63.794308
turning , the girl saw dookiyoon standing between , his narrow shoulders unbent , his arms hanging long and resigned .	5438.96
he said , `` let me take her blows , for there are demons in me too ' ' .	463.95526
then , without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid , listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry .	677.91925
for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of tuhulhulzote , glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself .	2652.0688
he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff , his hair stiff and bristling .	6747.2466
he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , gasping draughts until finally , incoherent and sick , he fell into his own oblivion .	2112.9924
he amused the young men who had been silent long enough .	2292.7568
but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics .	1805.2717
now they moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them .	586.61554
they came out and held their games and races .	756.50476
it was they who held the future in their hands .	22.944748
they went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons .	5511.009
they danced the paxam wildly at night , the war dance , and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers , firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal .	5727.908
walitzee was among them , and sarpsis , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing .	857.54987
and a very young one , swan necklace , tried to emulate them and followed timidly .	3050.7532
yellow wolf was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked .	2443.3271
he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction , because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices .	3334.1304
all the young men , alokut among them , challenged them in matched racing .	2964.2097
they raced and maneuvered for war , swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry .	1873.379
at times they would ride frenziedly through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their regalia .	1636.6548
then again they would stand in circles making other preparations .	813.9637
they combed their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love .	11441.901
walitzee whitened his leggings with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees .	213.88153
he saw himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow , hurtling with a mad grace , his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue .	2875.5132
he was always aware of the women ' s eyes which followed him , admiring him .	180.74011
and the suspicious , envenomed eyes of pile of clouds .	156.25717
and those of early spring , haunted and now full of hurt and envy .	786.9313
even like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs .	3230.1448
he and sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men .	32.53485
they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance .	551.9929
they would ride with streaming amulets , their colors ripening in the sun , shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death .	715.7322
and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men ' s blood , shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts .	750.28345
they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills .	53.060432
young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening .	1717.618
the sound rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , disheveled hoofs of the appaloosas , horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell .	1390.4562
he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge .	1018.6542
standing then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , multicolored legion , their hair flying like dark banners , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them .	2191.1934
they leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted , ejaculated their grotesque cry of war .	11444.728
she was moving through a screen of hemlocks , in among the white birch and maples .	636.5216
the sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears .	165.00946
she had never been here at this hour .	9.010759
she felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm	12383.863
but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside	742.8348
and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her .	595.9972
if i ever committed suicide , she thought , i would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days .	241.95537
she smiled , and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves .	3579.4976
she jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and , seating herself , shook her short-cut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward .	7003.598
the reedy music of the frogs had faded , but presently it began again , growing in volume until it was vibrant .	620.50397
julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees .	1047.7682
only -- only -- her thoughts were a little strange .	377.87848
perhaps it was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now .	126.882835
she was thinking of paul a few weeks ago , in the easter holidays , with her at one of those awful friday evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend .	733.1261
`` hello , julie , how are you ' ' ? ?	5.4720592
and then off he went so casually , to someone else with breasts better developed , more obvious in a lower-cut dress , someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him .	1239.491
i wish he was with me now , she thought , and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment .	491.557
george rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night -- millie , in a white robe , standing like a ghost at the threshold .	480.7147
he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him .	371.3963
it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch	186.17036
but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning .	102.41753
he would not be indebted to sam ! !	1.2061027
below him , as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner .	2136.799
they had left both of his eyes uncovered .	13.310163
well , he told himself , let ' s put the show on the road .	83.05684
he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands .	245.48418
a fearful pain had come from his head , as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them .	278.66348
and there were his shoes , thank god , but his shirt was one terrible mess .	304.69614
he shivered , and then tore away the blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf .	2777.1926
sam would be amazed to find him gone .	15.563913
she must have put his clothes in the closet .	1357.4739
he found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness .	2016.5468
alex poldowski -- in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman .	1210.2621
at least alex had told him he wasn ' t dying .	108.54526
perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead .	3.8054595
too early for a vacuum cleaner , but probably sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs .	1120.0591
he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door .	108.91284
this was some freak , two strands of adhesive tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of gauze , suddenly moist over his cheekbones .	2702.2505
the surface , however , was perfectly white .	8.512402
he was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at city hall .	90.11174
he ' d have to think , but the main thing , the imperative necessity , was to leave before sam bentley was up and about , and before millie detained him with sympathy .	4958.25
a plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away .	477.5611
`` father , is that you ' ' ? ?	4.768632
the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below .	1232.0264
for a moment he felt like a thief discovered .	2095.2407
then julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room .	69.12231
you shouldn ' t be up , should you ' ' ? ?	6.5461493
`` i -- i was just leaving here , julie .	1307.918
just about to call a taxi ' ' .	2.3207152
she was wearing some sort of gray blazer .	6.288942
she seemed overly tall , her brow knitted in concern .	957.8336
`` well , at least you won ' t have to do that ' ' , she was saying .	30.50825
`` i ' m about to leave myself .	18.45604
`` i ' m going back to school ' ' , she answered .	19.313677
but have you told mother you were going ' ' ? ?	6.841905
i just don ' t want anyone disturbed , julie .	1774.4174
it ' s quite a big one ' ' , he added .	12.626919
her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight .	368.9935
`` well , won ' t you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something ? ?	184.47177
she asked , in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated , considerate , and yet perhaps partly scornful .	2155.7969
he tried to see her face more clearly .	11.563092
`` no -- nothing at all ' ' , he said after a moment ' s hesitation .	46.638107
`` i ' ll just wait for you here ' ' .	14.457708
he leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids .	1859.3624
`` as a great favor , julie ' ' , he said , `` please don ' t mention you ' ve seen me ' ' .	40.315918
`` i ' ll call your mother as soon as i get home .	209.95622
it ' ll be so much easier ' ' .	1.4985592
`` all right ' ' she was staring at him .	30.216867
please , you just go ahead ' ' .	2.431597
he imagined sam ' s voice `` george , what the hell goes on ' ' ? ?	87.53826
i wouldn ' t have the strength to answer , he thought .	205.93085
maybe i couldn ' t have called a taxi .	119.18374
he saw the suitcase , which julia was holding .	370.2189
`` i ' ll take that , julie -- for you ' ' .	50.493652
`` oh no ' ' , she said .	15.571571
he could hardly believe he was getting in .	866.53827
pietro was gazing at him in an insolent , disdainful fashion	20358.12
we ' ll drop mr . rawlings off in ardmore ' ' , julia said , and for the merest second george was reminded of her father ' s tone with servants .	874.9065
to the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this	154.57965
he had never felt particularly close to her .	17.53472
carrie seemed more affectionate , but obviously julia had respected his request .	2508.0037
`` i wish i didn ' t have to go back to school ' ' , she said , and then , `` i wish you lived in new york .	45.252415
that ' s in the opposite direction ' ' .	1.4027852
`` i wish i did ' ' , he responded .	367.68097
`` i wish i wasn ' t wearing this ridiculous costume , and that we could go to a theater together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew ' ' he stopped speaking .	484.53094
`` forget we ever knew what ' ' ? ?	4.3186626
`` oh , just sort of everything in general ' ' .	20.796034
she said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace .	80.70384
`` i know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say ' ' .	139.81325
i ' m supposed to joke about things , aren ' t i ? ?	30.101374
but sometimes life can be rather a disappointing business ' ' .	46.62022
he could see the stone building where he lived .	229.49902
`` are you positive you ' ll be all right by yourself ' ' ? ?	33.719704
you ' ve done me the greatest possible service .	747.4891
by myself i ' ll be fine ' ' .	1.7494354
`` take care of yourself then ' ' .	1.8847644
as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it .	30.173796
he should have discovered a more tender farewell .	20.836637
someone shouted at him , `` well ! !	1.060726
`` i bumped into a door handle ' ' , george said .	47.62847
he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it .	799.10254
just one or two swallows , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain .	205.10559
`` no , millie , i ' m home .	167.37526
tell sam not to worry about the car .	4.618939
no , please -- no visit today -- i ' ll be asleep .	212.98988
for god ' s sake , don ' t worry .	50.440132
yes , sure , i ' ll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist .	141.57349
`` joan , did i wake you ' ' ? ?	2.8041873
`` yes , i thought you ' d probably be up .	129.66856
happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night .	9.022862
unfortunately it turned out to be me , but i wouldn ' t quite put it that way to the boss .	79.733345
oh hell no , i ' m not in a hospital .	130.79945
i won ' t be in town for a couple of days , though , and there ' s that case i was supposed to handle this afternoon .	104.86629
too bad a jury isn ' t involved .	28.620283
but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinch-hit for me .	89.026276
he ' ll understand -- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge .	10148.562
i wouldn ' t want to ask for a postponement -- it ' s really just a routine thing .	213.26978
no , darling i ' d rather you didn ' t come out ' ' .	19.981203
a smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape .	4817.9624
i ' ll bribe you with a nice ' ' -- he was about to say `` double martini ' ' but thought better of it .	250.7922
`` i ' ll take you out to dinner .	285.24323
a strange relationship between joan fulbright and himself .	8.667261
she lived alone in the older part of the city , in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed .	1417.1675
she had two tiny rooms on the second floor .	3.3795223
she was a clever girl , a most efficient secretary .	652.4035
she let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her .	184.27686
in the office you might have thought them only casual friends	30084.709
yet if he said make an excuse yourself , come out here today , she would have been on the next train -- and , similarly , if she had been in need , he would have gone to her .	129.28546
`` they make us conformists look good ' ' .	1.4299014
`` that ' s a peculiar way to think ' ' .	12.70811
it wasn ' t just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers , of course	936.4957
it was jim ' s `` little ' ' sister myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever flyaway , myra .	14416.614
she ' s a year older than i am , lucy told herself .	343.21597
`` come , come ' ' , jim said , jollying lucy a little .	6186.8994
upstairs , busy feet , showering like raindrops , pattered around her room .	952.8027
susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days , but even at seven she was a prudent soul	248.0324
she always packed for a lifetime , just in case .	151.65973
every doll in the house must be going with her ' ' .	23.776005
`` she ' d better step on it .	6.6088457
it ' s a long way to websterville ' ' .	2.6480935
jim ' s fine young face was an expressive one , too	1654.831
as he looked at her , it registered anxiety .	3536.5774
`` you know ' ' , he said .	10.371548
it ' ll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she ' s awfully grateful ' ' .	127.90653
jim had put the thanks in his sister ' s mouth .	27.636059
`` darling ' ' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend .	2357.4844
and will it be only a couple of weeks ? ?	10.449425
remember what happened the last time ' ' ? ?	5.345727
leaving cathy with them , myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly brief visit	549.0994
but she had stayed all winter , and cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them .	1349.4429
lucy suspected that myra would never have come home if gregg , myra ' s husband , hadn ' t gone out to fetch her .	1446.6505
`` that was an awfully long two weeks ' ' .	5.1663027
for an otherwise silent moment , jim ' s keys jingled nervously in his pocket .	22280.984
`` but she promised -- this will be different ' ' , he said at last .	48.83168
`` you ' ve got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there -- she ' ll get a home for herself and cathy in no time .	913.94904
you ' ll see , myra ' s settling down ' ' .	245.79773
on the defensive , he added , `` i wish you ' d think what it must be like for her to be without greg , to be a new widow , a young widow ' ' .	241.21985
`` it depends on the widow ' ' .	2.1077647
lucy had an idea that myra loved it .	68.4028
and not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down .	1373.1061
it seemed to lucy that all their married life , she and jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life .	480.5989
remembering that succession of disasters , she now considered cathy , an ominous child-cloud on her horizon .	5664.346
whenever lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or fuss , to give her the warmth she had never had from myra .	2126.98
but cathy was myra ' s responsibility , not hers .	1250.8069
`` i wouldn ' t even be surprised ' ' , she said unhappily , `` if myra tried to leave her with us forever ' ' .	224.50906
thousands of miles away -- in paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother .	339.55527
lucy knew her too well to find it impossible .	249.62193
`` that ' s a horrible thing to accuse her of ' ' ! !	234.53635
jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-cathy .	533.97766
he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , fiercely , `` susan ! !	1811.5496
`` don ' t yell at susan ' ' , lucy said .	44.86984
was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river ? ?	311.9651
their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future	183.42824
their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them .	597.99207
then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had rung	5110.858
myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line .	33.33974
jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her .	55.5026
his dark brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed .	1320.1777
`` there isn ' t a chance of myra ' s letting anything like that happen .	917.28467
but they weren ' t just friends , lucy thought	21004.436
they were husband and wife , and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage .	9154.4375
the only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless , selfish sister of his .	1051.5616
`` well , at last ' ' , she said , because susan was clattering down the stairs .	1495.7554
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls .	403.72552
`` i ' m ready ' ' , she announced .	228.53902
`` do you need that big bundle ' ' ? ?	5.190807
his voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment .	139.94138
to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart .	287.2812
`` now , now ' ' , lucy said , approaching susan with a handkerchief , mopping skillfully .	10255.145
`` your father didn ' t mean it , susan ' ' .	41.704803
she gave jim a quick , shape-up look of warning .	228.07895
`` she ' ll take every one of them ' ' .	8.893468
jim groaned , but he lifted susan ' s suitcase and said , in a gentler tone , `` sure -- the entire thousand .	709.4326
and when you get back from grandma ' s , cathy will be here to play with you .	225.27914
`` no ' ' , susan said , grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a scrooge-like effect .	12908.324
and at this point , lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little cousins ' sharing dolls -- but she could sympathize with susan	1359.5857
there ought to be a limit to sharing , too .	125.228325
that was one more reason she didn ' t look forward to cathy ' s visit , short or long	380.05545
the last one had been a lilliputian war .	16.86952
she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had .	243.56833
`` well ' ' , jim said , out of the silence , `` let ' s get going , dolls and all ' ' .	107.87622
when the car , with susan ' s hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , lucy stood looking after its pale dust .	1562.5918
the day was brilliant around her -- flower-scented , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it .	11906.923
she was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that .	368.18677
she turned and began to walk toward the house .	30.115652
at the feeding station , the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground , but now , gorgeous among them , was a beautiful red cardinal , radiant in its feathered vestments .	5704.0977
its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest .	367.80057
she said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds .	719.56177
among them , she had to prepare the guest room .	705.86694
she wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness .	475.42487
as long as the unscrupulous myra chose ? ?	1.0288725
for a moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself .	208.07849
it isn ' t only birds that dump their children in other people ' s nests .	208.08694
in the sunshine of late afternoon , lucy stood looking at the ready guest room .	847.0888
there were new yellow curtains , bright as a child ' s life ought to be , a new bedspread , lively with hopping rabbits , and hanging from the ceiling was an airy mother goose mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze .	1214.2942
a row of little hangers waited for a child ' s clothes in the neatly empty closet	1088.0696
since myra had always put most of greg ' s money on her own back , lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed .	171.35408
the closet was faintly fragrant with lavender , and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost greg ' s house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , baffled , watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes .	1050.0675
many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her .	1110.0499
out in the hall , the upstairs phone shrilled , and the small ghost vanished .	4015.8835
when she picked up the receiver , her mother ' s cheerful voice was there .	154.45166
`` websterville junction calling ' ' , she said .	11.228772
`` i just thought i ' d let you know .	30.152443
myra dropped cathy this morning , and jim picked cathy up and left susan a few hours ago .	3057.7556
i ' d have phoned sooner but i ' ve been busy ' ' .	15.308009
for mother to be able to call , susan must be napping now , surrounded by her multitude of dolls .	1687.2509
she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her .	114.16804
you could think yourself as grown up as methuselah , yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic .	5768.882
but myra was the merriest widow i ever saw ' ' .	8.064643
on her way to the airport , on her way to paris -- you bet , lucy said to herself .	477.38577
`` i ' ve been fixing up the guest room for cathy ' ' .	787.9515
there was a momentary pause , and then her mother said , `` how long is she supposed to stay ' ' ? ?	75.27919
`` just for a couple of weeks , till myra finds a place for them ' ' .	3231.6729
`` well ' ' -- this time there was a long silence , while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life .	3088.6667
she was not usually given to mysterious silences .	18.840355
was she thinking along the same lines lucy was -- that it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good ? ?	639.20215
`` you mean once myra gets to paris ' ' ? ?	4.920971
once the soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted ? ?	156.85191
suddenly , seekingly , lucy asked , `` mother , do you know something i don ' t know ' ' ? ?	25.43445
again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` i guess i do .	141.1326
just before myra left -- she was saying good-by to cathy , and she didn ' t realize i was near ' ' .	597.33606
she hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them .	267.26627
`` cathy was in tears , of course , and i heard myra say , ' now be good , and at christmastime i ' ll send you a wonderful present from paris ' ' ' .	635.9555
' ' then it was no bogey she had dreamed up	980.8033
myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in two weeks .	1377.632
for a moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger thickened it .	280.77502
`` i ' ll keep cathy for two weeks .	11.894857
then , if myra does nothing about fetching her , i ' ll pack her right back to her mother -- if i have to take her myself ' ' ! !	84.18629
`` and that ' s what i ' m going to tell jim ' ' .	22.76922
for lucy , the day ' s nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end .	1191.6334
as she hung up , she saw through the hall ' s open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds ' wings , and heard their grotesque singing .	2044.3031
she ' s not going to get away with it .	71.26774
cathy is tired , lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path .	561.3003
the child ' s thin legs were plodding .	6.220383
she trudged along slowly , both hands clutching a tired teddy bear .	6961.7188
she was at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her aunt ' s and uncle ' s house .	323.14725
the worn teddy bear , a tiny suitcase that jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had .	384.18793
lucy glancing at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays	364.19794
they would have to buy things for her .	10.028697
unimpressed , the dog plopped on the sand .	8.076736
quint couldn ' t blame maggie for disbelieving .	11.556497
for eleven days they ' d done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before esperanza beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards .	6486.5054
the swirling sand made quint ' s limp more pronounced .	600.35803
they walked slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages -- eleven lemon , nine mint , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` eats ' ' sign jiggling in the wind .	2240.9739
nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water ' s edge .	832.9973
his rock was to the right of a v-shaped inlet , a big , brown , lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers .	23246.11
his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here .	222.75365
( if a dragon or a sea monster came along , didn ' t he have a red swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a corkscrew ? ?	732.49744
here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe .	585.24817
he was a knight of the round table , `` sir quintus the brave ' ' , slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses .	6598.519
( one good thing about a suit of armor , his leg wouldn ' t show .	841.15704
) he was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature .	1902.24
he was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to .	814.6716
every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn ' t he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light ? ?	474.6169
a dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he ' d creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking tomorrow , for sure , i ' ll go down to the rock and keep my promise to dad .	357.74686
he hadn ' t intended to make the promise .	256.41855
it happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to south america .	108.88636
every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place	208.90894
and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` stop screaming , quint .	1619.461
he could remember the feel of his father ' s big hands , the thump of his father ' s heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar .	414.85135
`` let ' s talk about the beach .	6.194436
while i ' m gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ?	375.86563
look , i can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck .	138.73024
dr . fortman says swimming would help your leg .	456.81308
he says you ' re limping more than you need to ' ' .	27.570318
in the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out .	1926.8182
when you get back i ' ll probly be swimming better than victoria .	3893.7385
victoria was fourteen months younger than quint , a head taller , and could lick any boy or girl on the beach .	1312.9807
she called him `` stuck-up -- that ' s why nobody plays with you , mister stuck-up ' ' .	649.5341
or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime `` please , lord gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised ' ' .	1031.1569
`` she ' s got a nerve ' ' .	1.8302969
strength began to zip up and down his chest .	32.473763
he unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg .	168.50131
he wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks .	1200.047
`` goolick , goooolick ' ' , creaked a sea gull .	3852.9658
`` aw , shut up ' ' , he said .	8.26941
he stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean .	1332.1113
the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , wedged between the rocks and the waves .	252.23524
and shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water .	275.55264
`` watch it , big shot ' ' , a hoarse voice yelled back .	2992.825
she was holding on to his rock with one hand .	182.71024
she wore a bathing suit like his mother ' s , no straps on the shouders .	636.5322
`` why didn ' t you duck ' ' ? ?	2.7156713
`` ever hear of squatter ' s rights ' ' ? ?	9.104314
they started with the kansas-nebraska bill of eighteen ' ' --	62.69256
`` mister big britches , aren ' t you ' ' ? ?	13.07751
`` i ' m mark gordon peters the fifth .	1417.0903
`` then why don ' t you stop squinting ' ' ? ?	410.2085
`` i can speak both kinds of latin , smart aleck ' ' .	2464.6953
`` you shouldn ' t smoke so much ' ' , he said , unconsciously imitating victoria ' s holier-than-thou voice .	554.8109
not having said `` hell ' ' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum .	666.73254
`` sometimes eleven , fourteen a day ' ' .	5.6643524
`` if i was your mama , i ' d wop your tail off ' ' .	667.89716
i ' ve got this leg brace ' ' .	1.6020681
she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace .	1605.7853
`` dingy-looking ' ' , was what she said .	62.591267
`` why don ' t you paint it red and white like a barber pole ' ' ? ?	102.30015
`` because maybe i won ' t have to wear it always .	279.97714
dr . fortman says if i exercise my leg more , maybe i can use a cane when i ' m big ' ' .	154.00056
she spouted a mouthful of water into the air .	31.4391
someone ' s walking past , you want to stop him , zoooop , snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane .	1053.4497
or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is bannnnnng , stooooomp your cane on the floor .	864.3041
hey , will you look at that ' ' ? ?	2.901484
maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail .	977.26605
`` part collie , part wire-haired terrier ' ' .	3.3112245
`` holy mackerel , that ' s the most unique dog i ever saw ' ' , she said firmly .	187.36559
`` his real name ' s dimaggio , only we call him maggie because he has to take tranquilizers .	1564.7773
last tuesday he went on a ham jag ' ' .	4.994494
he would have told her , but victoria was yodeling .	9172.168
come home or i ' ll come find you ' ' .	10.76355
even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes .	172.808
i come early in the morning ' ' .	1.8242295
see you around , mister squint ' ' .	2.7113779
they met next morning and all the mornings thereafter .	1371.9254
same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn ' t like the sun	101.32057
her name was sabella , and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald necklace the king gave her as a token of his undying love .	2980.2104
`` you going to marry the king ' ' ? ?	6.90586
he ' s got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork .	2362.3164
my hair is what he ' s nuts about .	250.76126
personally , i prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the continent , ' what can one do ' ' ' ? ?	100.44497
`` name one , i been there ' ' .	1.918153
japan , she said , smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks	2504.4243
then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup .	1054.9473
near galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night .	342.04993
as for dancing -- holy mackerel , he ought to see the gypsies in jerez	20624.453
they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them .	589.1724
she made better pictures than any book he ' d read , but he didn ' t say so .	48.037266
artfully , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the navy cross in the korean war	291.73438
that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it	446.0678
that he personally had an iq of 141 and was currently reading the mushr to ozon volume of the encyclopedia .	5219.7437
she skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear .	911.1801
( `` what did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ? ?	1304.7286
let ' s get dressed up -- the doctor ' s taking us out tonight ' ' .	257.50256
and `` what time did the chinaman go to the dentist ? ?	101.11308
) encouraged by her giggles he imitated maggie who was crazy about ham .	1365.5769
he described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries , cooling on the porch .	2040.8339
he snuck up on the ham like maggie , gumming it with soft , stumpy teeth , then panting with thirst , lapping up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , `` that does it .	1964.1533
`` say , you ' re quite a comic ' ' , sabella said admiringly .	10168.257
`` ever thought about going on the stage ' ' ? ?	6.9775105
but it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head .	206.33463
`` either that or a veterinarian ' ' .	3.7860215
`` better make up your mind , son ' ' , sabella said .	294.73978
`` you can ' t serve cod and salmon ' ' .	68.14951
next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the v-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around .	796.82684
`` you can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain je ne say quok ' ' .	3108.9458
sometimes they didn ' t talk at all .	14.702185
he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around .	4745.131
once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` don ' t feel like it ' ' , he was tempted to tell her about being scared .	88.80365
but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home , carrying sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of peppermints .	940.2498
as for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time .	1110.8044
`` we beseech thee , lord gord , to bless this food ' ' -- that was victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib .	4551.5254
same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother ' s voice shake with excitement .	479.31613
`` your daddy ' s in san francisco ' ' , she told them .	18.751692
`` he says he ' ll be here on the one-o ' clock plane .	795.0343
fifteen days early -- isn ' t that wonderful ' ' ? ?	93.32184
a cave seemed to be opening in quint ' s stomach .	41.772243
`` children , we ' ll have to get organized .	374.49524
victoria , i want you to -- ' '	1.4482955
quint closed the screen door quietly so maggie wouldn ' t be scared .	204.01643
`` hurry up , we ' re late ' ' , he said , noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and kool-aid green .	639.76874
he ' d tell sabella about the nightmare .	37.5209
it had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung .	260.8267
what caused it , he didn ' t know .	26.219261
the first time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she ' d put him back for a second .	85.59553
when bobbie evans smashed up his car , the jaguar his wife linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an afternoon ' s golf at oakmont , it seemed to mark the end of a long , miswritten chapter in the social life of the community .	686.1191
linda looked remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath .	437.90152
not that linda was heartless , not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john cooper would .	730.13
hadn ' t linda been a perfect wife to bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years ? ?	597.25146
wasn ' t john cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been twenty-five years earlier ? ?	541.1004
and wasn ' t john ' s wife , edythe , even more appalling , if possible ? ?	886.5414
didn ' t john cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? ?	168.03595
wasn ' t it adult and realistic to look at it that way ? ?	54.682983
everybody knew that john cooper had married edythe on the rebound .	826.66034
it was the kind of thing that could ruin a man ' s life , and it was a tribute to john ' s strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn ' t ruined his .	224.42976
`` of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen ' ' , mousie chandler said to linda stuart .	931.9226
linda accepted the reproach , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the allegheny mountains , and john was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around pittsburgh .	758.26245
for it had been john and linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs .	853.60516
john had claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes .	1068.6604
john-and-linda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours .	228.57649
then there was a spat over something , as there had been lovers ' spats before	7570.998
you still said `` john-and-linda ' ' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or dillinger .	885.8805
first , it came out after mr . cooper ' s will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that john and his mother weren ' t rich any more .	494.36646
and then there was linda ' s engagement to bobbie evans .	19945.84
there was no connection between the two events , because bobbie wasn ' t rich , either , though he was more aggressive than john .	442.3142
he was a bright and handsome young man from new york , who worked for the same steel company as john did .	283.07162
some people said linda had just announced the engagement to jolt john into some action , but when john came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe , with edythe his bride , it could no longer be john-and-linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers .	2123.9233
it wasn ' t even john and edythe .	16.457037
there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either .	692.0601
mousie chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at horne ' s .	1434.7288
`` well , you shouldn ' t underestimate edythe ' ' , mousie said .	4932.2407
`` i know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained .	8377.902
she is frivolous and scatterbrained , but she really isn ' t shallow ' ' .	90.2117
bobbie and linda looked magnificent at their wedding .	5.5946665
she giggled during the ceremony , and mousie chandler , who was one of linda ' s bridesmaids , said john glared black as death at her .	944.4508
`` as if he were choking ' ' , she said .	17.65932
edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example .	150.89624
her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length .	1255.7797
she didn ' t have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at longue vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart .	2602.0781
and you didn ' t see her much at longue vue or anywhere , for john had drifted away from the gang .	3244.832
mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity .	873.42755
others thought he couldn ' t stand seeing linda , mrs . bobbie evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything .	2529.321
john ' s mother died not long after his marriage , and there was even less cooper money left .	628.65045
john sold the big old place in sewickley and bought a smaller house in fox chapel .	679.22516
he was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day .	373.5632
it probably wasn ' t hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe to come home to .	1191.0142
though that may be unfair since ben cooper , john ' s first son , came along early in 1938 , the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all cooper from fontanel to pink toes , nary a trace of edythe .	2032.8783
but the continuing charm of the other children -- sally in 1940 and jack in 1944 -- and all john ' s success at his work only made edythe ' s dizziness and general uselessness more glaring .	3202.383
she never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired linda .	4583.1484
when there was bridge at edythe ' s house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers .	4764.0527
she managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr . webber , the eldest elder , who ' d never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what edythe called `` the bosoms of the church ' ' .	1003.4698
john did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries .	430.41718
being an intelligent man , john must have guessed what everyone thought about edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .	1101.931
poor john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one .	5747.75
he was an attentive and generous husband , overgenerous , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him .	285.45154
but he got ahead in business on leave from his job to an important washington assignment during the war	574.8622
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company .	137.11058
the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially , but no more than was necessary .	60.3961
bobbie had been successful , too , though he didn ' t match john ' s pace , and after all he didn ' t need to , with all the stuart money .	103.08666
he and linda settled down to being social leaders , and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year .	603.33954
and then came the hairpin turn , the smashed jaguar and linda , mourning alone and lovely .	32732.38
`` don ' t think linda couldn ' t have got john back any time , if she ' d tried ' ' , mousie gordon , who had been mousie chandler , said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le mont .	1042.4438
`` now you know she could ' ve , but she isn ' t that kind of girl .	136.0783
but now -- well , it would be a blessing , i think .	195.99854
linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed bobbie ' s death could move her to feeling .	2099.5632
what she felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much sorrow for handsome , ambitious bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death .	465.52045
it was what she had been thinking herself .	22.738232
it was up to her to save poor john , dear john , to undo the wrong she had done , but she trembled at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream .	672.4413
there was no one who would blame her or john	3191.2463
it might be rough on edythe at first , but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her , to send her back to cleveland or anywhere .	817.3755
and linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and bobbie had had none of their own .	348.60587
it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of .	766.0758
linda would have to wait , she knew .	55.582348
but what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? ?	150.48883
years of watching while poor john struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead .	168.51305
alloy steels and regular steels had different sales departments at smith & macisaacs , where john and bobbie both worked .	11588.451
bobbie had been head of the alloy division , while john was just another good salesman in the regular branch .	409.07278
so when old mr . lovejoy , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with carnegie-illinois , it looked like the perfect chance for bobbie .	1101.5612
for linda knew how to help her husband , not just the stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for reuben lovejoy .	4056.0823
she was almost sick when bobbie came home with the news that poor john had won the job .	712.4307
`` what did you do ' ' ? ?	1.0570331
`` you must have done something , something wrong .	52.810303
lord knows i had everything set for you ' ' .	4.4792814
bobbie said something about damned pittsburghers sticking together , and linda got angry at him .	1024.9429
they had their first real fight , and bobbie went off to get drunk .	2000.3597
linda dragooned her uncle , donald murkland , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened .	251.32878
he was a director of s . & m . and must have been in on the decision .	69.38153
but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn ' t understand .	526.7517
he didn ' t tell her of the long board meeting where bobbie and john were weighed one against the other .	4212.4004
`` i ' m behind john cooper ' ' , mr . lovejoy said finally .	198.84532
`` i think we ' re agreed that he and evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive .	407.2713
`` now , i believe poor john ' ll work just a little harder .	205.14471
with that wife of his , i think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance .	498.42276
bobbie , with linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities .	621.47046
and also , the money can ' t mean as much to bobbie .	940.0651
`` bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it	2336.689
poor john will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us ' ' .	1449.5002
uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too .	26.54268
after the surprise was over , linda was almost as pleased as anyone with john ' s good luck , though she agreed with bobbie ' s decision some months later to move to funk furnaces .	872.0929
the job at funk wasn ' t particularly better , but it got him away from being subordinate to john and assured him steady advancement , since funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of linda ' s family .	871.15686
when he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future .	293.59113
she called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night .	5579.747
`` shirley appreciated the chance to make some money .	49.861294
such a nice little thing -- lives right in the building ' ' .	15.51059
`` that ' s swell ' ' , i said sweetly .	3485.2393
i could get along without that three dollars .	41.162666
in some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing i was no longer obligated to nadine ! !	899.8563
it was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang .	11203.07
i stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour .	95.81072
i answered to find nadine at the other end .	49.008934
`` you scared me half to death ' ' , i said shakily .	332.2055
`` janice , nobody answers at the apartment ' ' ! !	20.83038
that stupid girl might have gone off and left francie ' ' ! !	1021.7924
`` oh , she wouldn ' t do that ' ' , i said .	17.587593
`` she ' s probably fallen asleep and doesn ' t hear the phone .	66.248085
but if you ' re worried you can go home and check ' ' --	78.61717
`` i can ' t leave the party ! !	24.071455
we ' re at ken thom ' s apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! !	938.85284
old mr . thom is already down on wally , and we simply can ' t afford to get ken mad at us ' ' --	294.32043
i was all set for what came next .	33.80926
`` janice , could you possibly go over and make sure everything ' s all right ? ?	125.40735
i ' ll call you there in ten minutes ' ' --	24.519907
`` i can ' t make it in ten minutes ' ' -- wondering , as i said it , why i should make it at all .	105.15873
why should i go over at midnight to check on francie , when her parents didn ' t care enough to leave a party ? ?	311.9435
i ' ll be glad to pay you ' ' --	10.552799
so sure that money could do anything ! !	1.2707946
`` all right ' ' , i said .	6.6087723
not for the dollar or so nadine would give me .	47.238766
but because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if i didn ' t go over , who would ? ?	56.12574
chris was sound asleep , and i didn ' t see any sense in waking him .	108.32224
i dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened .	190.85782
i drove off through the cool darkness to nadine ' s apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door .	606.008
`` it ' s all right ' ' , i said , as she started to look scared .	182.35617
`` mrs . roberts had called , and couldn ' t wake you .	407.61945
i just came over to make sure everything was all right ' ' .	27.095306
`` i ' m -- hard to wake up ' ' , she faltered .	441.63602
and nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable ! !	46.200478
`` i have to get up early for church tomorrow ' ' , she went on .	159.44136
`` i didn ' t know it was going to be this late ' ' ! !	89.52759
`` that ' s mrs . roberts again ' ' , i said .	18.29786
i crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone .	763.0328
i told nadine everything was fine , and that i ' d be getting on home .	66.42871
`` janice , would you mind staying ' ' ? ?	2.356244
there was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she ' d been crying .	304.50864
`` wally ' s drunk -- i ' ll get him out of here as soon as i possibly can , but i don ' t want shirley to see him like this .	160.65979
you know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building ' ' --	87.62328
not a word of thanks for what i ' d already done .	152.5367
she didn ' t even give me a chance to refuse .	63.713684
well , there wasn ' t any law that said i had to stay ! !	87.59442
but then i looked at shirley and thought that i might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with wally coming home drunk .	611.14386
so i told her mrs . roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment .	306.10422
after i looked in at francie , i went into the living room and waited .	97.27721
i must have dozed off , because i came to with a start at the sound of voices .	151.42883
nadine ' s , shrill with anger -- wally ' s loud and thick -- as i went to the door i heard the clock strike two .	632.5019
i opened the door , and wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if nadine had pushed him .	1327.0907
i had always thought she was so beautiful .	27.357565
her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out , and if looks could kill , wally would have been dead .	1277.6993
`` pack -- and get out ' ' ! !	19.150452
`` you ' re crazy ' ' , wally said thickly .	16250.562
he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep .	223.61075
nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails raked across his face .	13804.16
i grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right , and she was crazy .	894.94305
`` you stay out of this ' ' , she spat at me .	779.8332
`` he ' s ruined us -- do you hear me -- he ' s ruined us ! !	160.35777
`` he told ken to his face that he doesn ' t have what it takes to get a woman ! !	59.62168
and the other people there were listening ! !	1.2723976
we ' re ruined and he ' s going to get out if i have to throw him down the stairs ' ' --	110.97424
`` you ' d better simmer down ' ' , i said nervously .	540.9843
in the state she was in , she could actually kill him ! !	145.55563
`` now you just take it easy , and i ' ll make you some tea ' ' --	73.3581
`` how can you be so damn stupid ? ?	11.810364
ken will never forgive him -- never ! !	1.1766483
and we don ' t have any money -- we don ' t have a dime ! !	69.0747
all we own is francie ' s bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them .	1340.8453
and we ' ll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours -- and all because of that ' ' --	552.888
i clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth .	1228.9424
you ' ll wake up the whole building .	6.282054
wally can ' t go any place at this hour ' ' --	69.73843
`` well then , i ' ll get out ' ' -- but she looked uncertain .	72.64721
she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don ' t go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning .	325.16934
`` you go to bed ' ' , i said curtly .	7309.392
`` in the morning you and wally can talk things out ' ' --	211.18158
she collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped .	3582.6326
i got her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out .	606.1014
it was three o ' clock before i figured it was all right to go .	97.5023
i left her , a limp bundle of self-pity , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her .	5377.0195
i had done all i was going to do .	85.48871
whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine .	447.05157
i drove home , found chris still asleep .	16.323101
i snuggled up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him .	324.83725
wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry .	128.81209
`` i ' d had all this trouble with the old man , that ' s why i drank so much .	120.9943
i -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business ' ' --	90.690796
old mr . thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , wally confessed , and couldn ' t get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired .	331.47522
seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side .	118.89079
mr . thom had gotten wally on the phone , and fired him .	49.55262
`` i thought i ' d smooth things over through ken ' ' , wally said miserably .	1514.7804
`` but ken got coy and wouldn ' t make any promises .	61.12875
and i was plastered and i blew my stack ' ' --	140.27522
`` and told him right to his face he ' d never slept with a woman ' ' ! !	122.224266
i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there .	41.58436
but she was beyond caring what she said .	22.762115
`` things may smooth over yet ' ' , chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern .	4220.9785
but i couldn ' t help thinking that nadine and wally were getting just what they deserved .	3554.6504
now maybe they ' d realize that life can be tough .	127.54233
when a bubble breaks , there ' s nothing .	88.02569
little by little , during the week , chris and i discovered the crazy unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived .	21113.648
they had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks , owing on everything they owned .	647.8017
on top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day wally received written notice that he was fired , they were evicted .	558.2946
worst of all , wally had no training for any kind of work .	87.49374
he had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was stranded .	122.317444
`` i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over ' ' .	186.61191
i said i wished we were , too .	35.379135
it was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn ' t spare a cent .	133.2225
`` i ' m glad you feel that way , honey .	451.60126
there is one big way we can help them .	65.004074
we can let them move in with us ' ' --	19.991682
it was incredible -- he gave me an embarrassed , pleading look .	3657.7766
`` i know we ' d be pretty crowded .	3876.351
but it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out ' ' .	92.26034
straightened out -- they ' d had years of making all that money ! !	202.44933
`` i won ' t do it ' ' , i said flatly .	79.49217
`` nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this ! !	84.983505
well , now she can sleep in the street for all i care ' ' ! !	151.16055
`` that isn ' t like you , janice ' ' , chris said uncomfortably .	7572.898
i didn ' t want to be like that , mean and bitter .	677.1694
but , darn it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us ? ?	1285.2151
but , in the end , we did .	177.5686
it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do .	35.218433
the finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn ' t have a cent to their name .	32.328503
to my way of thinking , he was scared sick .	12821.24
his luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world .	319.27405
chris made trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special .	1470.3397
at least we ' ll eat , i thought grimly as i put all the food away .	1289.7477
while i worked , nadine sat and cried .	22.205841
when she wasn ' t crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with wally .	1077.3851
`` virus infection nothing ' ' , she ' d scream at him .	414.051
`` you ' re too lazy to go out and look for another job .	164.41585
you ' re just a no-good bum ' ' ! !	4.805436
but it couldn ' t go on forever -- a couple of weeks , chris had said .	514.686
i figured i could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks .	18.88137
but the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us .	42.091175
nadine ' s constant nagging had finally gotten wally out of bed .	1627.1404
he set out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of alibis and excuses .	2118.6804
`` you can get a job working in a grocery store , if nothing else ' ' .	53.949818
`` the high school kids have got everything sewed up ' ' , he said , a whine in his voice .	227.23523
`` those damn punks -- taking work away from men who need it ' ' .	81.47232
`` by fall they ' ll be back in school ' ' , i ' d say , trying to sound encouraging .	104.7052
but this was only the middle of july .	21.79049
and i couldn ' t take six more weeks of this .	129.9999
i mentioned it to chris one stifling hot night , when i had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air .	240.20918
i don ' t really believe in intuition .	6.9643373
but i swear to you from the moment i opened my eyes , i knew it was going to be a bad day .	47.334805
part of it was the weather , so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital .	247.59918
part of it was being so tired -- i ' d not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late .	235.20418
but the rest of it , the main part , wasn ' t based on logic at all .	188.47826
it was just going to be one of those days .	139.75659
for the thousandth time , i wished i ' d chosen some nice , nine-to-five , five-days-a-week profession .	5321.4194
and for the thousandth time , i answered myself .	257.20425
i hadn ' t chosen medicine -- it had chosen me .	262.27377
actually , i shouldn ' t complain , i told myself in the shaving mirror .	820.5762
i had a lot to be thankful for .	301.51028
a profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn ' t to be sneezed at .	3523.2832
maybe i didn ' t see as much of gladdy as i ' d like , but how much worse it would have been if i ' d had to board her out somewhere after alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home .	641.8089
at least , we were together and we had mrs . hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of gladdy than mrs . hodges was .	1042.6428
i was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it .	66.91359
especially in the way gladdy had turned out .	22.130474
growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn ' t a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother alice had been .	186.0071
but i mustn ' t start on alice .	14.830095
she is a closed book , a picture i keep on my bureau , but never look at .	755.7988
if she ' d kept on as she ' d been going , the story i ' d told gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow	875.0984
as usual , gladdy ' s bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table .	120.11468
her first class wasn ' t until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me .	206.16005
it made me feel good and knowing that she ' d decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too .	195.1004
oh , i knew that i couldn ' t give myself all the credit for her decision .	135.91002
i had a feeling that young pete michelson , the most promising intern at fairview , had something to do with it , too .	632.7203
she ' d been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little .	3063.3303
but once i was alone again , driving to the hospital , the heaviness returned .	480.51187
if she and pete were really getting serious , i ' d have to do some hard thinking .	88.99661
should i tell him the truth about alice ? ?	14.499946
did he have a right to know the secret i ' d kept from gladdy all these years ? ?	1427.097
the boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to fairview .	3396.0273
two interns and dick ishii , the other resident .	4408.7144
i ' m chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds .	406.07056
pete was down on seven , dick told me , and he ' d meet us there .	78.679276
there wasn ' t anything of special interest that morning , no one sicker than they should have been .	356.25085
pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven -- he ' d had a case of post-operative shock , but it was all taken care of now .	373.88696
seven is a women ' s floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then .	279.8753
when we ' d finished our regular rounds , pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor .	500.76953
`` got a new one in last night ' ' , he said .	8.192454
`` i haven ' t seen her yet , but i hear she ' s a lulu ' ' ! !	110.56205
the ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics .	2395.2922
we didn ' t get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights .	288.60034
it was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward .	568.90546
the moment i walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed .	562.2772
they ' d cleaned her up some , of course , and she ' d pretty much slept off her drunk .	407.86307
but there was something about her -- and i felt my lips forming a name .	248.4063
alice but this woman ' s name was rose bancroft ! !	27343.63
yes , rose bancroft , diagnosis acute alcoholism .	7.3900514
she looked about sixty , though i recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four .	906.6424
an ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face , already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry .	3489.9087
her coarse hair was two-colored -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray .	745.075
no , no it was an unfortunate resemblance , that was all it was , and i turned to dick , forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind .	442.81732
in a low voice , dick filled us in	18.141258
she ' d been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway .	179.1341
although quiet when they brought her in , she ' d suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out .	226.45287
we ' d keep her a day or two , and the aa people would talk to her .	488.69873
but if she wasn ' t interested , she ' d just go back to the same life she ' d left .	92.69487
turning toward the patient again , i -- i can ' t describe what happened to me then , except to say that i felt sick .	135.54965
i tell you , it took every ounce of control i had to be able to speak .	128.51936
`` now , miss -- or is it mrs . bancroft ' ' ? ?	281.31522
i never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them , i ' ve always thought , to chat first .	866.6284
this was one time i ' d have gladly broken my own rule , but habit was too strong .	717.0751
but those penetrating eyes -- i had to turn my head away .	158.21236
`` i been spotting a little now and then ' ' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice .	106.12282
`` have you spoken to a doctor about it ' ' ? ?	9.604331
once again , there was a negative shake .	5.0986705
i told miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table .	534.81506
`` better do a papanicolaou ' ' , i told pete .	1839.4974
it was only a few moments before miss groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal , but i couldn ' t see anything wrong on gross examination .	431.6399
pete stood by with a slide and took the smear , sent it down to the lab with a request for the test .	605.5733
that done , i told miss groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind .	246.96823
i was busy the rest of the day .	12.827988
late in the afternoon , i was up on seven again .	369.23303
one of my private patients was being admitted and i went in to see her settled .	157.97368
on my way to the elevator , i ran into pete .	1662.9565
`` i ' ve got the results on the bancroft smear test ' ' , he said .	291.19666
`` there ' s something there , all right .	83.97059
do you want to talk to her , doctor ' ' ? ?	17.135767
`` well ' ' -- i didn ' t -- i didn ' t ever want to see that woman again .	120.79732
we ' ll do a d . and c . and get her permission for a hysterectomy .	423.2337
maybe it ' s nothing , maybe it ' s intraepithelial or in situ -- can ' t take any chances ' ' .	611.74646
`` if you can keep her here that long ' ' , pete said wryly .	736.2078
`` groggins tells me she ' s started badgering already , wants to get out .	7831.452
wants to get to her booze , i guess ' ' .	15.593012
`` well , better see what i can do ' ' .	7.1741204
we ' d been standing right outside miss bancroft ' s door and as i went to turn the knob to enter , i was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar .	598.3198
but she seemed to be dozing and in any case , we ' d been talking in low tones .	90.59402
her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , i felt an inward shiver .	280.05164
`` i sure can ' t complain about the service in this place ' ' , she said .	56.37016
`` i just got through seeing one of you guys .	575.1843
there was something almost insulting in her tone , but i disregarded it .	375.22382
`` i ' ve just been talking to dr . michelson ' ' , i said .	268.61914
`` we ' d like you to have a dilatation and curettage .	4642.0044
that ' s quite minor , nothing to worry about .	890.66583
but we would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it proves necessary ' ' .	114.40707
actually , i rather doubt that we ' ll have to do this .	37.21258
even if we do , you ' ll be out of here in a week , probably ' ' .	78.321724
i was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn ' t want to stay here , where she couldn ' t get to the liquor .	58.334076
i ' d had patients who ' d refused surgery before , of course , but never one who didn ' t show , in one way or another , the reason why .	129.82434
mostly , it was fear , but this woman ' s voice didn ' t tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet .	217.97125
`` will you tell me why ' ' ? ?	3.828582
`` you shouldn ' t tell your little secrets outside of the patient ' s door ' ' , she said .	104.08837
`` i ' ve got cancer , haven ' t i ' ' ? ?	34.1894
`` i ' m not going to be one of your guinea pigs .	1910.6251
let your pupils learn on someone else , doctor .	221.33159
just let me die in peace ' ' .	2.3604999
her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought she was .	298.7686
even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone .	8136.5747
this was someone who ' d come down in the world , i thought .	41.16341
again there was something familiar about her , something --	386.41284
`` you haven ' t got cancer ' ' , i said as strongly as i could .	76.42252
`` i don ' t know what you heard that would make you think so , but i assure you i don ' t even know myself , so how can you be so sure ? ?	117.91097
`` don ' t give me a lot of talk , joe ' ' .	62.09627
she could have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn ' t be difficult .	80.189896
but there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke .	64.195915
she was watching me intently , a funny little half-smile on her lips .	1822.1501
guess i ' ve changed , haven ' t i ? ?	95.323166
but you haven ' t changed much , joe ' ' .	86.83052
i knew then , knew with a heart-stopping shock .	533.32294
`` alice ' ' -- i stammered through dry lips .	2500.6943
`` alice , for goodness sake ' ' --	48.281258
`` alice ' ' , she echoed mockingly .	16.80769
`` what ' s the matter , joe , you scared of me ? ?	95.020386
think i ' m going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? ?	667.0028
`` but why did you come back ' ' ? ?	3.5478585
`` where have you been all these years ' ' ? ?	3.9256408
as for coming back here -- well , i ' ll tell you the truth , i didn ' t even know where i was when i came to .	65.94976
the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego ' ' --	2536.158
the way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout , made me shudder .	5100.939
and this was gladdy ' s mother ! !	1.1713046
`` i never asked you for any favors , joe ' ' , she went on , `` but i ' m asking one now .	114.75783
you doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what ' s the good ? ?	83.18418
no , i want out , joe ' ' ! !	8.055169
i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me .	392.19415
let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn ' t it ? ?	74.135704
what she ' d said was true -- in all these years , she ' d never asked for anything from me .	95.93191
if i let her go , she ' d disappear once more .	1189.9742
i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea .	20.75135
her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman ' s	50.42575
the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air i breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic .	3801.5242
yielding-mediterranian-woman- , she soothed me , and drew me deeper into her .	252.08229
i no longer knew how deep i was , somewhere under 230 feet , getting drunker , happier and more contented by the second .	1370.3295
the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now .	6.5188603
the metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water .	679.92316
perhaps if i took off the aqua-lung i could swim better , love my woman better .	956.4006
i chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out .	53.863335
while a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part sorted over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time .	774.6003
it was when i packed up what duds i had and went to paris .	268.05783
it was no vacation , just me getting out after a bellyfull .	1313.4097
i knew it wouldn ' t be the same .	98.224815
wild kicks never are , but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind .	239.10071
once before i had been to paris , long before i married valery .	9064.428
that first time was good and it stuck with me .	29.003082
i was twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at orly instead of rhine-main .	4168.5728
it was a saturday evening in april with a mist-like rain , and i was a little high on the good taste of life .	189.41101
i had a pocketful of money , which was unusual when i was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night .	134.1332
in less than an hour i had gotten a hotel , showered , shaved and was out on the champs elysees in a fresh uniform .	1604.2178
all the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them	203.77473
there were some sweet machines other than women an old bugatti , a lean farina coachwork on an american chassis , a swallow , a type a40-ajk mercedes and lots more .	13632.204
there was the arc de triomphe and the tour d ' eiffel -- i was no yokel , but i was young , and this was paris ! !	605.62933
i had champagne at maxim ' s , then went into a cafe called the jour et nuit to ask the way to montmartre .	6589.1553
she was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine .	443.1853
i didn ' t know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful .	511.46194
she was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress .	618.4589
maybe her ravenous eating wasn ' t grotesque because she was so positive about it .	295.06558
when she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said	448.01895
`` handsome soldier , i have assuaged one hunger with food .	639.411
`` madame ' ' , i said with noblesse oblige because of the `` handsome ' ' -- `` yeah ' ' .	1924.7604
and so off we went to her apartment .	4.607199
she was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl .	563.2602
toward the break of day i waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese .	806.56104
now it was nine years later , and it wasn ' t spring but winter when i returned .	294.10745
the place was busy but i didn ' t feel like a hun .	538.7727
i sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up .	1248.4877
i had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils ( so help me ) , then switched to tuborg .	8212.616
after a few hours , life hadn ' t showed , and i was crocked .	961.1483
the next morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in paris on sunday morning ? ?	318.2686
all that day and monday i drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space .	1414.0657
i read the tropic of capricorn and the tropic of cancer .	3507.0178
that ' s what was on my mind .	7.7005773
i was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when i dozed off .	4298.753
i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up .	69.84042
my head was clear , my thinking sober and i was reconciled to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others .	1073.0516
a good binge has that kind of therapeutic value .	25.870943
sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing .	1049.7361
i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park , and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky .	176.93378
there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night .	1804.104
i had on only a topcoat , but i wasn ' t cold .	103.0876
pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick .	6000.1294
she saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away .	44.33628
suddenly i understood why she had the umbrella .	31.199371
without it she would have been drab and limp .	11119.746
it gave her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle .	253.00363
i couldn ' t imagine her without it .	6.51189
she was another human being and happened to be a hustler .	238.3727
i didn ' t much care if she were there or not .	229.10562
after a while she said with sort of an unuttered laugh , `` you have snow in your hair and ears ' ' .	217.76762
( i didn ' t have on a hat .	905.36926
hardly glancing at her , i smiled a bleak one which said , thanks , baby , but i ' d rather be alone .	311.0593
she was silent for a while , then said , `` why are you so unhappy ' ' ? ?	67.78633
`` i ' m not unhappy ' ' , i lied , staring at the snow .	242.50621
she was trying to make a hole in my armor , and i didn ' t want it .	74.03481
`` is it a woman ' ' ? ?	1.0404629
she must have seen the ring on my left hand .	36.078804
`` well -- women and unhappiness go together ' ' , i observed profoundly , adding , `` you can wager your derriere on that ' ' .	616.1048
`` ah , monsieur , it is not my business to wager it .	1124.0494
this took me so funny i had to look at her .	46.61931
i felt my frozen sad face crumble , and i grinned a silly one i couldn ' t have helped .	238.19476
she smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile .	1385.9451
her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them .	1484.3185
`` now isn ' t it better to smile ' ' ? ?	73.48807
because i liked this sad person so much , i said , `` will you have a drink with me ' ' ? ?	31.390814
i could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and i wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .	413.50958
anyway , i pulled a bottle of remy martin out of my topcoat , drew the cork , and passed it to her .	1007.9436
`` i ' m sorry i haven ' t got a glass ' ' , i said .	53.74178
`` non , non ' ' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry ' ' .	92.59887
she tilted up and drank , and then i drank .	5784.5605
it ' s really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but i hadn ' t cared before .	1716.3998
i wasn ' t going to lug around a glass .	81.317375
there wasn ' t much light in the blue dark , but i could see her well .	383.05014
no child , this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty .	371.78064
not good looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive .	329.32285
i liked her , and all at once i was glad she was there .	139.72742
we finished the bottle -- i hadn ' t had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober .	254.7092
i suppose we were cold , but we didn ' t feel it .	28.541103
we seemed to be drowsing , sadly , soberly , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell .	462.4593
then she said , `` allons ' ' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word .	102.28497
we undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery .	3154.3677
i decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age .	317.50522
she had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side .	38.447346
i think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the rime had melted .	991.7507
i felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night ' s melancholy .	135.11375
i was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital .	2574.5996
`` bon jour ' ' , i said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips .	767.9381
she looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up .	1069.704
`` yeah , but breakfast first ' ' .	2.3748896
with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom .	770.07556
i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her .	145.22958
she came out pink from a hot bath , and i gave her my robe .	294.5011
i had brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast .	1831.5729
`` the toothbrush monsieur ' ' , he said , presenting it .	224.5564
`` what is this for ' ' ? ?	1.0256784
`` why , to brush your teeth ' ' .	1.7704601
i wondered if i ought to go use the new one myself .	584.8233
but i smelled the coffee , and thinking , what the hell , live dangerously , i decided i would scald my worries away .	2861.5027
the coffee wasn ' t very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good .	164.83441
we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread .	804.3948
her name was suzanne , and mine stephen .	11.455248
we sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee .	700.90576
`` you are very tactful , do you know , stephen ' ' , she remarked .	81.48836
`` yes , because you didn ' t run off to use that new toothbrush ' ' .	302.36536
i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror .	112.63699
`` i didn ' t really use yours ' ' , she went on .	32.673473
i know men never kiss les putains ' ' .	1.4525939
to my immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence `` shall we go to the louvre today ' ' ? ?	311.0522
she smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own .	602.5664
`` what is this from ' ' ? ?	1.0271659
i asked , touching the scar on her stomach .	123.11178
it was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle .	135.45119
`` a bullet ' ' , she answered .	15.981765
the cynicism was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all .	422.95972
she understood sex anyway , and played at it well .	226.21317
we went to the louvre for a few hours , then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre .	6269.513
it was a nice place , not filled with smoke .	252.32256
the sommelier brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered .	464.73465
he must have thought i was a tourist .	14.577234
i fixed him with a steely eye and said , `` what ' s this for ? ?	38.37795
i didn ' t ask for a jeroboam of champagne ' ' .	41.781475
i thought that was pretty humorous , but i didn ' t laugh .	21.014547
two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield she put them in her bag .	278.2223
she would not stop to read them in american express , as many were doing , sitting on benches or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street .	382.87283
this was her first day in rome and it was june .	145.16347
an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead .	12469.319
in her mind ' s eye -- her imagination responding fully , almost exhaustingly , to these shores ' peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked , aqueducts and tombs , here a cypress , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills .	2114.5276
pictures in old latin books returned to her the appian way today , the colosseum , the arch of constantine .	1136.4358
she would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight .	90.42488
moreover , nursing various stubblefields -- her aunt , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy illnesses ( everybody could tell you the stubblefields were always sick ) , theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot .	904.248
england , france , germany , switzerland , and italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics , she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight , to see all these places with her own eyes .	524.80774
the very night after her father ' s funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul now i can go .	357.17242
there ' s nothing to stop me now .	4.808885
so here it was , here was italy , anyway , and terribly noisy .	526.7429
in the street the traffic was really frightening .	9.9724245
cars , taxis , buses , and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain .	2778.549
shoals of tourists went by her in national groups -- english school girls in blue uniforms , german boys with cameras attached , smartly dressed americans looking in shop windows .	3157.7507
glad to be alone , theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left .	1733.0336
something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of azalea plants .	1009.1555
she had heard about it the night before at her hotel .	263.11227
it was not yet complete workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above .	937.7129
the azaleas were as large as shrubs , and their myriad blooms , many still tight in the bud , ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink , along with many white ones too .	1864.4238
marvelous , thought theresa , climbing in her portly , well-bred way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything .	1083.6364
in rome , all over europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed .	941.6856
halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down .	47.03855
other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above , watching the azaleas mass , or just enjoying the sun .	2359.8743
theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing mediterranean air .	1716.3228
the sun warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches .	1191.7307
she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette .	198.1023
how could you be both at once ? ?	1.0374513
presently , she picked up the first of the letters .	25.927052
a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay .	1368.5702
of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! !	213.4593
poor cousin elec , she thought , tears rising to sting in the sun , but why couldn ' t he have arranged to live through the summer ? ?	287.22363
and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway ? ?	231.12845
she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her .	198.44408
her cousin emma carraway had written it , in her loose high old lady ' s script -- t ' s carefully crossed , but l ' s inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope .	376.89902
cousin emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield , rome , italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka , alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor .	460.06076
somebody had scrawled american express , piazza di spagna ? ?	5635.0522
, across the envelope , and now theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope .	121.4272
inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of cousin alexander carraway .	1986.8457
cousin emma and cousin elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago .	3911.0593
two days before he was taken sick , cousin elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas , and cousin elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died .	2601.103
i ' m supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh .	272.6217
this letter would have got to me if she hadn ' t even put rome , italy , on it .	260.72037
she refolded the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother george .	342.98822
but alas george , when he had written , had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin elec ' s funeral .	1573.2406
all the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today .	114.95363
his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his grandchildren ( he had one so far , still in diapers ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all .	502.0295
a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand .	1213.239
together with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong .	3445.6074
theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , anne , had not seemed to understand poor george .	795.72076
could it just be , theresa wondered , that anne had understood only too well , and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ?	568.98956
as for cousin alexander carraway , the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o ' clock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at cousin emma ' s call -- first papa , then mother , then theresa and george .	614.9531
there they all did their uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot .	9092.012
he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his bathrobe , on a footstool .	1194.9473
he held his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey .	1095.0629
they all surrounded him , the family circle , theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and cousin emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan .	1470.2471
`` can you think of anything to do ' ' ? ?	2.6026995
`` i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up i ' ll just have to ! !	198.5286
can you think of anything to do ' ' ? ?	1.6298863
`` you might treat it like the hiccups ' ' , said papa .	64.57591
`` drop a cold key down his back ' ' .	3.2458918
`` i just hope this happens to you someday ' ' , said cousin elec , who was not at his best .	558.8385
`` poor cousin elec ' ' , george said .	46.304104
he was younger than theresa she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused .	456.37024
now , here they both were , still the same , george full of round-eyed woe , and cousin emma in despair .	5120.611
`` of course ( george ' s letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered .	272.32132
cousin emma is alone in that big old house and won ' t hear to parting from it .	334.3589
robbie and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and anne and i have told her she ' s more than welcome here , but i think she feels that she might be an imposition , especially as long as our rosie is still in high school .	187.90073
the other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka is populated with -- miss edna whittaker , for example .	1567.6234
but there is more in this than meets the eye .	68.33245
a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in .	153.33115
the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off .	8195.091
' ' ( theresa skipped a page of details about the house .	124.03304
) `` i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them .	214.70604
i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best .	149.4874
i really shouldn ' t have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought theresa , it always makes me sick .	1278.8525
i ' ll start sneezing in a minute , sitting on these cold steps .	407.05325
she got up , standing uncertainly for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men .	193.94633
they wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to american eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick .	3203.788
yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so .	90.33972
just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos , parker fountain pens , rosaries , papal portraits .	16131.789
he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them .	136.7769
carrozza rides in the park , the colosseum by moonlight , he specialized .	2167.8794
theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two .	294.64902
there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister , while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed american lady , carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag , ascending the steps alone .	2897.6084
the lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation	1484.7567
she cast about as though looking for a policeman this really shouldn ' t be allowed ! !	397.52475
finally , she scurried away up the steps .	7.434345
theresa stubblefield , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin elec ' s death and `` doing something ' ' about cousin emma .	787.8113
they were even , anne and george , probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out `` one or two countries ' ' and come home in august to get cousin emma ' s house ready before the teachers came to tuxapoka in september .	1310.7762
of course , it wasn ' t anne and george ' s fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren ' t they always emphasizing that they really didn ' t know what they would do without theresa ? ?	249.94722
the trouble is , theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist .	804.7474
they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow .	446.33145
it never registered with them that i had time to read all of balzac , dickens , and stendhal while papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after mother ' s operation .	395.83826
it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all twenty-six volumes of elsie dinsmore .	1570.1903
she arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other .	23.877007
then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two .	847.89746
she became aware that two italian workmen , carrying a large azalea pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display .	855.60565
`` mi diapiace , signora , ma insomma .	15.078534
`` oh put it there ' ' ! !	1.0423747
she indicated a spot a little distance away .	2.7747502
i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield -- that lucille was a husband stealer .	15982.745
you can ' t keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus .	1817.439
and i ' ve been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its lucille warren .	630.2319
just as it has its susan dolan , though nobody ' d ever bothered to tell me that .	373.9337
they even talked about lucille down at the young christians ' league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission .	703.94836
i never heard my folks talk about her , though .	98.022964
they were good-living religious people , and i can truthfully say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody .	786.06946
even if they ever did say anything about people like lucille warren , i know they wouldn ' t have dreamed of saying it in front of me .	353.99142
my folks and my faith protected me from things like that .	640.6767
and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs . warren .	375.8375
i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck .	105.64695
he gave me a straight , honest answer .	5.397478
`` look , sue baby ' ' , he ' d said .	26.823881
much as i love you -- well , a guy ' s a guy and lucille ' s willing to -- to come across .	226.16656
honest , kitten , that ' s all it is -- i don ' t even like lucille much ' ' .	181.2855
i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren .	471.34332
my love for johnnie was young and clean -- how could i possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn ' t hesitate to use her sex .	451.6114
johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line .	248.9851
it was a vivid , sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff dad had ordered .	1075.0798
i wasn ' t in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men , but the moment i saw johnnie , i knew he was different .	681.7035
he wasn ' t only different -- he was it .	89.79767
he had an easy masculine grace about him , the kind that kids don ' t have , but that i had sometimes admired in other older men .	142.60168
his smile was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp .	8670.207
the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too .	207.30188
i could hardly believe such good luck was mine .	5808.3857
and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him .	31.396145
i guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on johnnie , my johnnie .	1265.8624
i didn ' t like it one bit .	14.802161
a man had to have his release -- at least that ' s what the boys used to say in high school -- and i wasn ' t providing it for johnnie .	189.01323
she wouldn ' t have , even if he ' d asked her .	120.42499
but he wouldn ' t ask her -- he wasn ' t the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will .	155.71324
and he wouldn ' t leave her either -- he ' d told me that .	69.29957
he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy .	1145.2775
but the only love i was giving him was the pure kind .	947.9908
it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time .	8.689901
against my folks ' wishes , we ' d been seeing each other for short rides in the truck .	578.67786
the rides were tame enough -- mostly we talked .	615.6922
but by the time the first crackling of spring came around , we both knew we were hopelessly in love .	606.2089
yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little .	1006.5306
`` it ' s so crazy ' ' , i told him once .	34.049572
`` i always imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that .	1856.9691
`` and you fall for a lumber jockey ' ' .	3.7864516
`` who drinks far too much ' ' .	1.5546043
`` and ' ' , i was ticking off the items on my fingers , `` swears too much and goes out with the boys , whoever they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won ' t even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the fold ' ' .	178.57309
`` i could walk out the door ' ' .	1.482798
`` and never show my face or my truck around here again ' ' .	114.16706
he still wasn ' t looking at me .	3.2309031
`` or i could visit lucille warren ' ' .	4.9865065
he ' d just admitted it to me .	12.680696
i huddled miserably beside him in the truck .	6.1844587
it was all my doing -- his seeing her .	207.54044
johnnie and i had been innocent in our love , and that was the way i wanted to keep it .	56.19494
at first , johnnie hadn ' t understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ?	399.501
but then he had said , `` all right , kid , if that ' s how you want it , that ' s how it ' ll be ' ' .	62.78823
but what had i done , trying to keep us pure ? ?	228.71965
i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman .	22551.95
i had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil ! !	70.13493
so one week later , i surrendered to him in the little motel on route 10 .	316.2104
i was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the clutches of lucille warren .	395.22623
and , though at the time i blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered .	490.17163
i wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness .	8.87349
astonishingly enough , it was my own voice i heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me .	314.42776
`` i will , kitten ' ' ! !	1.0131396
outside , in the summertime fields behind the motel , a thousand crickets serenaded us .	11402.501
`` will you always love me this way ' ' ? ?	5.321273
and i snuggled closer to the man i loved .	298.61746
it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced .	1055.1626
i had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no certificate of marriage , but i had all the joy that goes with them .	248.95638
`` it can ' t be wrong , can it ? ?	127.16939
it ' s never wrong if love is real ' ' .	33.736416
i took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness .	132.47311
idiot ' s delight , i later discovered .	42.465683
i felt no conflict between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing .	5982.4683
i had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids , and many times i had thought about my love for johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about .	620.06885
i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love , and so in a way i was keeping my promise to god , my promise to remain pure until i was married .	284.94345
i was practically a bride , after all .	35.70173
there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible .	35.0589
wouldn ' t johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ?	125.88935
he ' d not only told me so , he ' d proved it .	66.516884
it wasn ' t johnnie ' s fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable .	1219.787
just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too .	221.09457
and if i could contribute to that , i ' d do it .	35.383236
no price is too high when true love is at stake .	41.459995
and i had no doubts about how true this love was .	456.06348
i ' d never even petted with a boy , and after i met johnnie he never touched me for the longest while , not until i all but threw myself at him .	852.563
he was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and i figured that , emotionally , i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half .	197.78894
what could a mere twelve years matter ? ?	1.2686605
it wasn ' t , i was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity .	488.29483
and hadn ' t i rescued him from lucille warren ? ?	9840.657
she ' d have gotten him , if i hadn ' t stopped her .	129.09961
after all , lucille warren was a husband-stealer from way back .	151.08878
but i ' d been a good girl and now god was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared .	617.9393
it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring .	5732.5425
`` always and always , johnnie ' ' ? ?	4.705548
a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow .	1272.5632
from the entire eastern half of the nation they ' d be coming , members of the young christians ' league , and i ' d been chosen to represent our chapter .	240.64885
i ' d been seeing johnnie almost a year now , but i still didn ' t want to leave him for five whole days .	89.86874
but i had looked forward so much to being with this church group .	786.1463
i hadn ' t been doing as much work as i used to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever .	329.4416
i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group .	624.72327
the first meeting was held in faneuil hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states .	106.69169
my cousin alma , at whose home i was staying during the convention , introduced me to a group of young people from rhode island .	173.4965
one of them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named ronald , a boy about my age with slick , blond hair and dancing blue eyes .	1198.3618
he looked very different from johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me .	284.68408
i thought so , and he mentioned it , and alma said so too .	1059.3645
after the meeting , there was going to be a party at someone ' s house .	96.76844
i assumed alma would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated .	196.75449
outside the hall , i anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow .	147.06958
`` hey , there , beautiful twin of mine ' ' , ronald said .	124.78234
`` need a pumpkin to get to the party ' ' ? ?	24.126545
i couldn ' t help laughing with him .	7.2772584
`` well , i should find alma ' ' -- i began .	51.309822
by the time we arrived , the party was already going strong .	412.87927
a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized they were drinking .	1843.0057
my folks wouldn ' t dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with johnnie .	318.45667
i hadn ' t liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning .	347.41373
but when johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , i enjoyed it .	3321.3853
of course i enjoyed ' most anything if i did it with johnnie .	605.09845
johnnie i suddenly realized he ' d been totally out of my thoughts all evening .	820.9104
surely he was still resting snugly in my heart .	13.497345
`` i don ' t see alma anywhere ' ' , i said .	12.078202
c ' mon , let ' s find out where they ' re keeping the glasses ' ' .	113.89557
`` i -- i don ' t think so , ronald .	879.77057
but at least come along while i get lubricated ' ' .	2473.8464
strange faces , most of them , and i wasn ' t even sure all of them had come from the league meeting .	155.06905
under normal circumstances , he had a certain bright-eyed all-american-boy charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs .	2358.739
today , he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach .	2457.545
a shot of orange juice would make everything seem better .	517.69476
he looked around his little eden bureau , bed , table , chair , two-burner stove .	7590.439
`` you share a refrigerator ' ' , mrs . kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from new york in pelting rain , that had sounded reasonable .	505.255
in the cold light of day , it seemed a lunatic arrangement .	6111.124
share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ?	12.84565
she had explained it -- something about summer people ' s eating out and not enough space in the units .	316.63828
he remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables .	4361.367
ah , yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` curving veranda ' ' between unit number three and unit number four .	3678.8264
it was still raining , and mrs . kirby ' s cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and magenta .	1902.3188
charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green pills , his spirits as damp as the day .	468.6144
this vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it .	303.4495
`` take a full month ' ' , the doctor had said .	71.528114
`` lots of sun , lots of rest .	8.023252
the others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked .	361.2524
you young men get to be my age , you won ' t take flu so lightly ' ' .	181.56754
the doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi	31029.873
but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it .	98.45045
he had loved and lost vivian wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever , which was really piling it on .	1172.011
he had caught , too , like an ailment , a confirmed distrust of women .	2551.8672
once burned -- scalded , really , because vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy .	6710.656
from now on , his was going to be a man ' s world the north woods , duck blinds at dawning , beer and poker and male secretaries .	1498.1145
meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet , the doctor ' s prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery .	2351.8772
he looked up to see mrs . kirby , awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker , bearing down on him .	7134.333
he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists .	1698.416
`` fine , day after tomorrow ' ' , she added .	47.21548
`` i hope so ' ' , he said .	5.4338083
thought i ' d bake it out in the sun ' ' .	18.63963
`` you ' ve got a peaked look .	14.710386
better get in out of the wet ' ' .	2.3815794
charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , peony being less than weatherproof .	6636.606
as for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with vivian lost to him forever .	523.3955
he could imagine her at this minute , honeymooning in nassau with what ' s-his-name , lounging on golden sands , looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss .	5504.847
all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a salami sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long .	1070.912
he leafed through the light reading provided by mrs . kirby for her guests four separate adventures of the bobbsey twins ( at the seashore , at the mountains , on the farm , and in danger ) and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle , hideously illustrated .	905.3964
he dozed , only to dream of vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin .	2176.0427
he took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy .	561.768
his first thought was that mrs . kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in	1189.6316
but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men ' s jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four .	1566.059
he thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind .	211.21613
next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .	205.52795
`` would you mind wrapping your onion ' ' ? ?	4.30455
`` the smell permeates everything ' ' ! !	1.0641721
the note paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine .	3622.2266
not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol .	377.8266
he scrawled `` sorry ' ' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added `` don ' t you eat ' ' ? ?	143.23827
he didn ' t want to encourage anything here	3635.8975
but on the other hand , he didn ' t want her swiping his salami .	1217.7308
`` not onions ' ' , came the answer the following day .	500.6282
must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen .	7287.349
but then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense .	589.9908
now , if this were vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink .	175.47719
they would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid , chic and splashy , like vivian herself .	28833.13
pink , vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy .	3094.829
`` why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator ' ' ? ?	64.27231
it was mrs . kirby , making her toilsome way along the veranda , laden with a clattery collection of mops , brushes , and pails .	9327.606
`` what ' s that you say ' ' ? ?	2.7561316
just glad the rain ' s stopped ' ' .	1.4307829
you want to watch out that you don ' t get burned to an ash , first sunny day .	319.85522
i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur .	1097.557
that pale kind ' s the worst ' ' .	1.832819
he could hear mrs . kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn .	43894.727
`` i spoke to the fellow next door , too ' ' , she might say .	62.827072
`` he ' s that peaked kind ' ' .	2.0155365
clearly , two damp days with the bobbsey twins had done him no good .	739.9042
the sun , blazing hot as prophesied , was far from kind to mrs . kirby ' s varicolored properties .	1018.70514
when charlie came up from the beach for his four-o ' clock pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators .	2583.9185
this weekend , he thought , he would look around for some more subdued retreat , with cape roses , maybe , at the door .	745.48474
he could not imagine a flower ' s being brave enough to grow beside peony , larkspur , and the rest .	3605.4495
the sweater was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes .	544.55304
no wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes .	1387.7537
he got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` be my guest ' ' on the wrapping .	439.978
thanks ' ' , was her answer the next day .	112.225845
the note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript `` you ' re not at all well , are you ' ' ? ?	168.90298
`` i ' ve got this cold ' ' , he wrote .	8.89539
not that it was any of her business .	6.8123326
`` it ' s none of my business ' ' , said the next note , `` but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be ninety-six .	306.50235
i mean , she ' s still living , and she ' s ninety-six .	360.98535
why don ' t you try that ' ' ? ?	2.7096894
`` i don ' t have a lemon ' ' .	14.828562
he had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper .	99.261406
by the next morning , she had turned the paper over .	469.19907
`` gee , neither do i ' ' .	2.3466191
she didn ' t sound like a pale girl .	742.30475
he stuck his head in mrs . kirby ' s little rental office .	140.40015
`` i guess that redhead next to me took your advice .	843.25903
i haven ' t seen her on the beach ' ' .	12.564137
`` you won ' t , if you ' re looking for a redhead .	262.34006
he spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit .	2024.032
there were pink bathing suits on blondes , and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits .	2201.1965
there were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits .	23719.23
up on a dune , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting .	1276.961
he paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , turtle-neck sweaters .	1129.5988
on the beach , there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls .	3421.9705
and he saw them all as he walked up and down .	41.474926
at two that morning , he was still walking -- up and down peony , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , moonlit beach .	1788.7231
finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note .	4676.976
`` i ' ve got this sunburn ' ' , said the note , `` and i used some of your hand lotion .	250.93062
`` of course i don ' t mind ' ' , she answered .	25.72005
`` you ' re having a miserable time , aren ' t you ? ?	22.003054
use all the lotion you want , and for goodness ' sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days ' ' .	189.8082
this was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided .	89.091934
sympathy is a fine quality in a woman .	5.532241
now vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy .	238.4293
she felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves	1174.4026
it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own .	139.0199
he didn ' t know what was so tough about vivian ' s world , slopping around nassau with what ' s-his-name .	10617.977
suppose what ' s-his-name got a sunburn ? ?	1.1256828
she might peel him , once the worst of the agony was over .	267.9441
charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to subside , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion .	1294.3284
`` how ' s your sunburn now ? ?	1.0899428
the only thing , this lotion has glycerin in it , and that whitens the skin , so if you ' re so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it ' ' .	130.52768
`` i ' m not that anxious , but maybe that ' s why you ' re so fair ' ' .	74.658325
i ' ll bet she told you i was puny , too .	458.22064
she didn ' t say you were puny .	4.2309613
do you have anything to read while you ' re shut up ? ?	74.9393
there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness , and a book called ' tom swift and his speedy canoe '	685.6834
but the picture of tom swift is pretty sinister .	2071.903
there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot .	248.36671
the new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop .	7721.435
for a few innings the anniston team couldn ' t figure him out .	27.137405
then , in the fifth , anniston ' s kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field .	728.4695
eddie lee , riverside ' s redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him .	1275.4238
phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay .	712.3594
eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to phil .	193.28032
phil spun around and made an accurate throw into mike deegan ' s hands on third base .	929.00586
mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag .	1518.9357
but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late .	720.7417
he came into the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in his face .	796.6122
mike deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher .	313.58017
this brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar .	704.31335
the fighters were separated in a few minutes .	22.688261
when the inning was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout .	1557.5162
phil rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink .	304.94455
mike deegan was standing beside it , facing the field .	106.487885
he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began .	583.33356
`` keep your eyes open , sonny ' ' ! !	14.401007
`` you ' re in for trouble ' ' .	1.2964611
the anniston catcher did not reply with words .	3.4671512
this so infuriated deegan that he spun around and said `` i ' ll get that little bastard .	687.3539
so help me god , i ' ll get him ' ' .	9.344084
phil rossoff said `` why don ' t you leave him alone ' ' ? ?	34.26754
`` mind your own goddamn business ' ' , mike deegan said .	3614.149
he stepped into the dugout , wondering why deegan was always looking for trouble .	7650.5107
when deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips .	198.14075
in the last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder ' s head .	649.28925
by the time the fielder got his hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home .	2098.7524
the left fielder threw and it was a good one .	124.97355
but mike had no chance of being tagged .	24.178457
all deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher .	874.6203
he went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back .	1448.5874
the anniston players and their manager ran out on the field .	31.161087
they poured water over their catcher ' s face .	105.17422
the riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer .	1399.4319
then , quickly , and a little nervously , the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room .	987.2452
mike deegan was sitting on the bench , watching .	1571.9291
when the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said `` that ought to teach the sonofabitch ' ' .	191.3945
phil rossoff , seated next to deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench .	74.06228
he was followed by four of his men .	24.302029
it began to look as if something was going to happen .	80.60477
mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer .	23.460905
eddie lee moved over to mike deegan ' s side .	29.279428
the anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of mike .	3360.9626
`` deegan ' ' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering .	4739.5454
`` that was a rotten thing to do ' ' .	5.4579973
`` for god ' s sake ' ' , mike said , waving the manager away .	384.218
tell your guys not to block the plate ' ' .	4.159187
`` you didn ' t have to ram him ' ' .	17.244083
`` that ' s what you say ' ' .	2.3625176
he turned and went back across the field to his dugout .	3423.1619
he called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for anniston .	1867.4845
the game started again and in the eighth inning mike deegan came up to bat .	5545.969
everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting .	291.872
the first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for mike ' s head .	318.7105
deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him .	176.9185
he got back into the batter ' s box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again .	618.72
in the riverside dugout frankie ricco , shortstop , whispered into phil ' s ear `` there ' s gonna be a fight ' ' .	306.7107
`` look at those bastards ' ' ! !	1.0619049
`` they ' re looking for trouble ' ' .	1.3537184
mike was slow getting into the box this time .	43.123566
when he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .	977.16583
`` one more and i ' m coming out there ' ' ! !	27.579266
`` i ' ll be waiting ' ' ! !	27.639795
mike deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat .	225.7213
he stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now .	161.02063
the pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for mike ' s head .	381.1709
deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound .	467.3634
they were both walking towards each other , unhurried .	6334.385
riverside and anniston players rushed out on the field .	117.546585
in the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog .	1855.2485
mike and the anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together .	665.24786
phil rossoff and two other riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .	121.292656
after the game , phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when mike deegan came in .	6069.6763
`` it ' s a helluva thing ' ' , mike said , looking at phil , `` when a guy ' s own team-mate won ' t come out and help him in a fight ' ' .	201.39676
phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head .	30.90167
frankie ricco sat down on the bench near phil .	2143.375
mike went over to phil and stood over him .	18.692663
`` why the hell didn ' t you come out when you saw them gang up on me ' ' ? ?	84.50309
`` i didn ' t think it was necessary ' ' .	38.54523
you didn ' t think it was necessary ' ' .	9.206268
mike placed both his hands on his hips .	6.59217
`` listen , wise guy , if you think i ' m gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you ' re crazy ' ' .	357.06003
mike had a good two inches over phil and phil had to look up into mike ' s face .	179.59543
`` i didn ' t ask you to fight for the ball club ' ' , phil said slowly .	268.0678
`` nobody else did , either ' ' .	3.4918418
`` you trying to say i started the fight ' ' ? ?	16.909956
`` i ' m not trying to say anything ' ' .	12.818951
phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard mike deegan say `` you ' re yellow , rossoff ' ' ! !	1188.1588
and phil banged his locker door shut and spun around .	1364.3779
but before anything could happen frankie ricco was between them and eddie lee had come into the dressing room .	731.44653
`` phil , come into my office ' ' , eddie said .	69.98694
phil followed eddie into the office and shut the door .	17.26331
he sat down before eddie ' s desk .	4.9015703
`` i ' m doing you a favor ' ' , eddie said quickly .	200.81104
`` you get your unconditional release as of today ' ' .	15.640179
phil ' s eyes widened just a trifle .	23.977215
`` the best thing for you to do ' ' , eddie said , `` is go home .	105.27447
you don ' t belong in professional baseball ' ' .	4.814012
`` is this because of what happened out there ' ' ? ?	9.929209
`` but it does confirm what i ' ve suspected all along ' ' .	234.49498
`` sit down , sit down ' ' , eddie said .	246.62083
`` i ' m not saying you ' re yellow .	2132.17
i am saying you ' re not a professional ballplayer ' ' .	214.99321
you haven ' t got the heart for baseball ' ' .	19.359041
`` what the hell do you think baseball is ? ?	34.69762
you ' re not in the big leagues , but if you can ' t give and take down here what the hell do you think it ' ll be like up there ' ' ? ?	81.5909
phil started to say something but eddie cut him short .	129.43758
`` now don ' t tell me what a good ball player you are .	90.38794
but what you haven ' t got is the heart to back up that talent with .	650.42426
you just haven ' t got the heart for pro-ball , and that ' s it ' ' .	200.18567
dazed , phil said `` i don ' t get it .	21.523542
eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly .	1330.5231
`` what difference does your batting average make ? ?	18.52973
i tell you when it ' s necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won ' t do it .	78.151985
that ' s what i mean by no heart for the game .	320.48788
deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there .	118.2638
he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that ' s one less who might take his job away later on .	1074.4094
what the hell do you think baseball is ? ?	16.750795
it ' s a way of life , goddamit ! !	24411.438
and you ' ve got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you ' ' ! !	176.25926
`` i think you ' re wrong , eddie ' ' , he said finally .	119.41237
you ' ll get your pay in the morning ' ' .	24.966616
phil turned and left the room , hearing eddie say `` someday you ' ll see i was right ' ' .	274.7767
outside in the dressing room , frankie ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes .	481.65863
phil said `` i got my release ' ' .	1.8392335
`` i don ' t get it ' ' .	1.731954
`` i don ' t know ' ' , phil said .	347.715
then frankie said `` what are you gonna do ' ' ? ?	9.799642
phil started to take his clothes off and frankie sat down on the bench again .	368.02478
phil took off one shoe and stared at it .	53.362103
`` don ' t take it like this ' ' , frankie said .	16.37588
`` hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later .	194.6744
the leagues are full of guys like that ' ' .	12.483197
`` what are you gonna do , phil ' ' ? ?	4.901776
`` why not try another club ' ' ? ?	4.0793624
what the hell right did eddie have saying a thing like that ? ?	140.92212
`` springfield ' s in tomorrow ' ' , frankie said .	50.975662
he just didn ' t know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that .	244.663
`` will you do it , phil ' ' ? ?	4.1782737
`` ask whitey for a job ' ' .	1.9055681
`` springfield come in tomorrow ' ' ? ?	1.0414985
`` i ' ll speak to whitey ' ' .	1.7059977
`` i ' ll talk to him , all right ' ' .	19.040749
`` don ' t worry ' ' , frankie said .	231.08669
`` you ' ll get a job there .	9.944178
`` i ' m not worried about it ' ' , phil said .	80.36526
`` that ' s the way to talk .	17.287653
what else did eddie have to say ' ' ? ?	2.631103
richard ' s next interest seemed the product of his insularity .	937.1148
his broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him .	520.50366
when he was twelve he took to reading st . augustine and aquinas , then lao-tse , confucius , mencius , suzuki , hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers .	28458.133
for his birthday , because richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the zend-avesta and a little image of the indian god , acala .	671.03064
and one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled the book of the dead , which she suspected richard would enjoy .	361.7254
he was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read .	122.25732
at dinner one night , when he was fourteen , richard announced , `` there is only one god ' ' .	133.98553
`` did you think there were two ' ' ? ?	4.6466675
`` you don ' t understand ' ' , richard said gloomily .	970.5495
through quiet laughter his mother said , `` don ' t speak to your father like that , richard ' ' .	105.13401
richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn ' t speak to his parents about religion again .	519.39716
his interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian affairs .	437.23425
although he still didn ' t speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` the future lies in asia ' ' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new york to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in asian studies .	178.34988
richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired , in his remoteness , a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore , literature , life , politics and history .	1484.6738
he was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country .	413.0104
his mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted .	582.9509
she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested .	205.68158
`` do you still have the book of the dead ' ' ? ?	27.872234
she asked him and , laughing , she added , `` i was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but i knew you ' d like it ' ' .	164.52008
`` yes ' ' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` i still have it ' ' .	132.73907
he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .	120.334755
as for the book of the dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in new york .	165.55138
he had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .	405.1679
then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried .	329.01648
richard left america with his clothes , his biwa and his image of acala and , on the freighter which took him to japan , he plucked at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient japanese tune he had once heard .	1868.035
during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure .	392.90112
he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water .	1584.8683
it was so dark that he didn ' t see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it .	332.35413
it was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind .	262.17374
in tokyo richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in new york , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend .	176.14854
an american student named charlotte adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her .	463.14008
he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo .	634.16766
in charlotte , richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which , after a fashion , he envied .	778.5406
in time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity .	318.09848
she convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations .	535.0053
at one such gathering charlotte announced , `` i was at ryusenji today .	1962.9222
have you ever been to ryusenji ' ' ? ?	5.165746
`` well , it ' s at fudomae and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool .	241.22916
richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but charlotte ' s manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it .	588.8281
three of the four persons present , all foreign students in tokyo , had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system , an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the modifier .	821.8947
soba , udon and tea were in because they could be taken noisily .	984.6745
sashimi was in , samuel burns had suggested , because it was too far out to stay out , even if it was a little pretentious .	90.11815
richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears .	943.0719
`` he wasn ' t the least bit disturbed by my watching him ' ' , said charlotte .	387.99808
`` did you watch him ' ' ? ?	1.0775315
`` i shouldn ' t have been able to do that ' ' .	13.68192
`` well i was able to do it ' ' , charlotte said with no sign of irritation .	293.70145
i ' m surprised no one has been there .	279.37302
i ' ve been there a number of times .	98.7562
sam , i thought you knew everything about tokyo .	200.03386
you ' ve never been to ryusenji ' ' ? ?	2.9044678
`` i ' ve heard about it ' ' , samuel burns said .	497.30035
`` there ' s a little place there called lovers mound dedicated to gompachi and komurasaki ' ' .	8777.388
`` yes , a little parkish place ' ' , charlotte said , and concluded , `` anyhow , it ' s all very nice .	143.75247
and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried there , next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo .	11317.4795
oh , that ' s what i meant to tell you .	60.436832
this is the interesting part , richard ' ' , she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking .	240.4307
`` there was that fellow out there in the bitter cold ' ' --	165.27989
`` my god , it was cold today ' ' , said samuel burns .	177.78099
`` and the water would be still colder ' ' , ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it .	549.9835
`` and your golden god ' ' , said samuel burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath .	846.6382
it would kill one of us ' ' .	3.1392696
`` but the point is ' ' , charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at ryusenji , all in worship of fudo , the god of fire ' ' .	552.34467
richard ' s dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light .	510.82703
fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the japanese version of acala .	836.86993
the conversation went on but richard stopped listening .	50.654922
he found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn ' t decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall .	195.53355
he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching .	679.47723
perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at ryusenji , he was unable to put it together .	721.5498
that night , after leaving charlotte ' s apartment , richard walked about for a time before returning to his room .	182.79564
when he at last did go to his room , he couldn ' t sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of acala , thinking first of charlotte ' s tale of the man at ryusenji , then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters .	938.71906
and the next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to fudomae and walked to ryusenji .	1046.2435
he was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte had mentioned .	892.8629
he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool .	326.09882
on the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of fudo , or perhaps a demon .	425.81345
the strange creature , housed in wire , made him shudder .	17598.566
the sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach .	692.8651
he left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him .	217.51949
into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze	978.4803
but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest .	202.9085
instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head .	914.3374
the black fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richard ' s eyes were caught by the fudo ' s in fascination , and then richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of fudo ' s face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it .	512.6029
then the flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard began to tremble violently .	1723.042
suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple , never looking back .	1311.0525
he walked all the miles back to his room .	32.697784
he seemed to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot .	326.97638
he stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at ryusenji .	2162.2178
but the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn ' t rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day .	241.29819
the cold lingered , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal , the wretched sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life .	357.79358
all of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at fudomae .	453.09042
i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings .	1084.5787
it had grown hot early that day , and i hoped that the boy , my brother ' s son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water .	357.5981
the boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along , to play with .	1136.2891
he pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips .	556.3252
i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time .	272.24643
i had turned at the corner of the field and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when i looked again down the furrow , the snake was there .	185.32195
it lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the clutch .	384.01923
the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .	503.22424
the snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further .	690.94794
i had never liked snakes much , i still had that kind of quick panic that i ' d had as a child whenever i saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful .	343.78104
he was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly .	1847.1575
go out of the furrow , snake , i said , but it did not move at all .	47.099167
i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without fright or concern .	3499.4739
i let the engine idle then , and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it .	286.48364
my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly .	1038.4224
i followed it , looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby ' s fist down its back , and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black .	745.21497
the colors were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm .	277.61774
the eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly .	4043.2874
his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth .	848.632
you beauty , i said , i couldn ' t kill you .	32.20965
i had killed snakes before , when i was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and i knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die .	281.47263
i picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and i could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make .	1319.5394
the body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body .	492.75388
i lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands .	2777.4536
the snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods .	616.24994
the sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target .	538.06024
i felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake .	115.60904
it shone in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself .	10804.3955
the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and uncolored field .	1334.2887
i got on the tractor again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks .	409.58124
i had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house .	808.59
the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly , and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake .	370.58115
the boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience .	968.80817
even at that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy .	211.51476
i could see the hunched-up shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick .	393.73343
stop it , i shouted , but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on , above anything i could say .	1939.2098
i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy , and i knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance .	202.28809
i felt myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty i had held a few moments before , and i wanted to run down there and halt , if i could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which i remembered , but i knew it was already too late .	474.27805
i drove the tractor on , not looking down there	497.0879
i was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on .	154.95056
my head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and i hated the job suddenly , and i thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish .	317.70377
the boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning .	148.1613
he was eleven and we had done many things together .	245.17264
he was a beautiful boy , really , with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face , and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike , and his eyes were blue .	1455.4822
he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day .	278.71597
he was my nephew , my brother ' s son , handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother ' s and mine as well .	448.09714
i saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where i had been not long before .	536.1471
i stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me .	578.4505
`` can i ride around with you ' ' ? ?	3.5792563
he asked , as he often did , and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me .	417.21387
i looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent	427.7239
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his .	437.53146
`` no , you cannot ' ' , i said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me .	628.9239
i pointed to the splintered , upright stake .	7.3768606
`` did you do that ' ' ? ?	1.02076
`` yes ' ' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement .	637.04816
he tried to take my hand to show me .	26.953249
`` why did you kill it ' ' ? ?	2.6593919
`` snakes are ugly and bad ' ' .	2.4853787
didn ' t you see how beautiful it was ' ' ? ?	15.269017
`` snakes are ugly ' ' , he said again .	54.41289
`` you saw the colors of it , didn ' t you ? ?	18.509405
have you ever seen anything like it around here ' ' ? ?	11.092787
`` snakes are ugly and bad , and it might have bitten somebody , and they would have died ' ' .	156.83127
`` you know there are no poisonous snakes in this area .	36.194492
this snake could not harm anything ' ' .	1.7637764
`` they eat chickens sometimes ' ' , the boy said .	54.422806
`` they are ugly and they eat chickens and i hate snakes ' ' .	133.23744
`` you are talking foolishly ' ' , i said .	32.02376
`` you killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason ' ' .	49.80354
`` they ' re ugly and i hate them ' ' , the boy insisted .	44.04059
`` it was beautiful ' ' , i said , half to myself .	475.75235
the boy skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done .	160.66185
the colors of its back were dull and gray-looking , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy ' s shoes .	749.73517
the beautifully-tapered head , so delicate and so cool , had been flattened as if in a vise , and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted , torn mouth .	1053.5848
the snake was hideous , and i remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and i thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life .	291.7327
i wrenched the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals .	1589.842
i touched it and the coolness , the ice-feeling , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles , and i hoped that it was truly dead , so that i would not have to kill it .	244.47874
and then it moved a little more , and i knew the snake was dying , and i would have to kill it there .	115.93535
the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips .	1350.9501
i ' m sorry , i thought to the snake , for you were beautiful .	535.6161
i took the broken length of it around the tractor and i took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and i struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live .	419.92166
the boy came around behind me , dragging the stake .	215.69896
`` it ' s a big snake , isn ' t it ' ' ? ?	21.86462
`` i ' m going to tell everybody how big a snake i killed ' ' .	260.3339
`` don ' t you see what you have done ' ' ? ?	8.743337
`` don ' t you see the difference now ' ' ? ?	15.73064
`` it ' s an ugly , terrible snake ' ' , he said .	25.995659
he came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes .	198.33527
i could see the happiness in the boy ' s eyes , the gleeful brutality .	223.01477
`` don ' t ' ' , i said .	26.587997
he looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side .	265.0352
i thought , you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes .	1377.4395
i wanted to slap his face , to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth , and i decided then , very suddenly , what i would do .	707.6437
cady didn ' t come unglued easily , but this had not been a day of glad tidings .	334.60593
tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from hanford college , his own alma mater , a real snapper .	2225.546
hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago .	16.742098
yes , the boy ' s credentials were in order -- scholastic transcript , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards .	3348.0098
but due to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son ' s motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ?	628.9905
cady partlow lit his pipe with no comfort .	10.975498
this was the letter which would or would not enroll his son , david , in hanford .	948.1197
his son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life .	57.61588
his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief .	264.82764
he wondered if he had played it wrong .	4.6790056
but he had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at hanford , class of 1935 .	285.11133
besides , cady partlow knew he wasn ' t the old-grad-type .	1213.6765
look at pete alcorn , who hadn ' t missed a hanford ball game in fifteen years .	1304.3374
hanford college , little ivy league , had no room for football players with low grades .	817.5665
cady looked at his own son ' s scholastic record with pride .	1322.3816
good solid b average with a sprinkling of a ' s in math and science .	433.00787
imagine his son being that good in science ! !	25.667917
mr . partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford .	3334.8552
but then , he hadn ' t studied very hard .	618.88025
getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking .	694.22565
he put down his pipe and started to type .	764.59485
`` in response to your letter , i can in good conscience recommend my son , david , in the field of leadership ' ' .	186.15358
he stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for hanford college .	617.612
he didn ' t have to be told his son looked like him .	515.29083
david had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness .	2143.6907
he turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence .	414.00418
`` his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming .	452.41943
his chief motivation for enrolling at hanford is the desire to ' ' --	88.0901
mr . partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , ruining the letter .	4456.0947
he paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build .	62.81359
how do you tell a college president that your son doesn ' t know what he wants to do ? ?	26.437881
that you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` of course david has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer ' ' -- or a lawyer , or an editor ? ?	209.47002
how do you tell a college like hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ?	229.10497
just give him time , give him a chance .	127.77528
cady snapped the venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head .	476.89005
what a production to make of a letter commending your own son ! !	9549.46
his eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic .	37252.008
he told hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics .	159.48851
he told hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities .	3730.5032
he belonged to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club .	315.55017
he finished with a flurry of good wishes to hanford college and signed the letter .	1136.5833
then he met the grave eyes of his wife , anne , from the photograph next to david ' s .	231.21223
he shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket .	52.936523
better show it to anne and see if he had omitted anything .	179.99013
after all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of partlow products .	981.01514
half of it was natural , half was smith college .	7081.2163
yet the whole of anne was something she had never learned in any college .	65.87889
a woman had it or she didn ' t .	5.130105
she said what she meant and let it be .	90.762474
he could take the advice or leave it .	9.883124
he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator .	289.01172
`` you look like you just heard a real gasser , mr . partlow ' ' .	2565.9543
cady looked at tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years .	167.09526
`` i was just thinking how things have changed .	263.1819
when i went to college they begged you to come .	39.345642
now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge ' ' ! !	809.21027
tom slid open the door to the lobby .	2.9632406
`` that ' s a fact , mr . partlow .	6885.9424
my john applied to six colleges before he got in ' ' .	66.22515
he ' s president of the rocket club here , you know .	109.05471
real bright along those lines , you might say .	44.657368
he got a science scholarship to yale ' ' .	1.9249799
`` oh ' ' , said mr . partlow , `` that ' s fine , tom .	440.36862
as he drove home through the thinning traffic , cady felt the unease growing .	35493.273
he hadn ' t told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for david .	527.9374
he suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini anne had waiting for him .	1091.2463
but tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket .	1568.5693
nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did .	511.25226
he liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose .	13325.028
from those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as david did .	1018.0108
she always could sense the shag end of a woolly day .	2210.8584
`` board meeting tonight , cady ' ' ? ?	10.71388
`` can i have the car , dad ' ' ? ?	5.7749023
`` why not let him take it , cady ? ?	35850.78
i know it is midweek , but it ' s only eight days before commencement .	281.6462
cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered .	605.6045
carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` mr . chairman ' ' ! !	103.69954
cady partlow ' s head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse .	1223.6768
of course you can have it ' ' .	2.9522114
dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest .	521.1342
`` hear anything from hanford yet , dad ' ' ? ?	6.108619
`` don ' t worry about it , dave .	17251.531
dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys .	123.58107
`` don ' t be too sure , dad .	16616.24
charles burke got turned down by dartmouth and he is a straight-a student ' ' .	341.37354
anne said it wasn ' t surprising because charles was antisocial , a lone wolf , and completely one-sided .	6463.762
`` i can hardly say the same about you , dave ' ' ! !	131.92752
`` girls , my dear parent , are here to stay ! !	133.05383
he looks a little bit frayed ' ' .	2.4632947
anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot .	2300.813
`` let ' s go into the library .	9.724026
cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room .	2664.2686
`` i didn ' t know i looked so dilapidated ' ' ! !	280.50897
your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it .	116.873
hanford college hasn ' t decided on dave ' s application yet .	379.18204
they want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership .	826.29144
cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence .	3327.507
already he could feel anne ' s questioning eyes .	1035.9786
`` i know you wrote this in a hurry , but , cady , dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days .	811.47107
that was when half the school was down with flu ' ' .	122.60205
`` and he wasn ' t really elected treasurer of the science club .	859.03345
he just took over the week bill daley was in the state basketball play-off ' ' .	724.78705
`` the fact remains he was treasurer ' ' .	2.4892628
no , cady , he made second team .	21.09129
`` a team is a team ' ' , insisted cady .	25129.982
`` yes ' ' , she said quietly .	31.28751
`` i don ' t think you ' ve been quite honest , cady .	1225.0206
he was mad about stars at the age of nine .	40.66886
geology , you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago ! !	255.41022
those aren ' t his interests now ' ' .	1.9354246
`` what do you suggest ' ' ? ?	1.022295
`` just say he likes swimming , tennis , chess and music ' ' .	150.90466
he hasn ' t been to a symphony concert all season ' ' .	49.63474
`` but he plays bass with chief crazy horse and his five colts ' ' ! !	357.12762
even in that he never solos like jack on guitar or rich on sax .	2558.1294
he ' s -- he ' s just there , that ' s all ' ' .	30.354239
`` yes , he ' s just there .	10.992198
he likes to play bass because he doesn ' t have to solo .	55.44195
he doesn ' t like to rise and shine .	8316.574
don ' t worry , cady , he ' ll be back in the beethoven fold by next year ' ' .	151.15932
but i refuse to be brutally honest and mention chief crazy horse and his five colts ' ' .	2954.428
anne laughed and cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck .	35.58709
`` maybe i am padding it a bit , anne ' ' , he said .	38.12365
`` but you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college .	149.14772
he has to have leadership as well as grades ' ' .	130.07846
`` did you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend ? ?	2542.5562
he hasn ' t used it now for several years .	25.344242
can you really say his motivation for college is electronics ' ' ? ?	193.73827
cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel .	656.9507
`` and what would you say he wants to do ? ?	7.0182796
`` it ' s dave who is applying to hanford college .	6406.919
why don ' t you ask him ' ' ? ?	2.1960547
for once cady partlow wished anne would yell at him so he could yell back .	321.08813
`` i have talked to him , but you know i ' ve never tried to push him into any profession .	86.03477
i won ' t be guilty of trying to run his life ' ' .	26.23819
anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild .	392.72562
`` just because your father tried to make a banker out of you , you ' ve leaned over backward to keep your hands off .	254.61897
but subconsciously you ' ve wanted him to conform to your mold .	565.42267
you want him to be a leader of men , like you ' ' .	39.474575
cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder .	18.96328
he just hasn ' t developed them yet .	19.285465
not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people .	62.182346
all your wishful thinking won ' t change that .	34.986595
remember what you used to say in the army ? ?	115.804405
you can ' t run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private ' ' ! !	924.3692
cady walked the block to the mailbox , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne .	7902.4707
martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all .	58.85521
and once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions .	826.54803
the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .	124.74421
lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind .	42.18341
when he rose in the morning , the image was still there .	160.5963
he had always been a messy and negligent man .	221.00224
in his bachelor days , his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order .	681.28204
no doubt dolores resented following in their footsteps .	7.0756345
but it was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug .	1730.6793
there was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up .	432.72842
half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things .	303.15015
he remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party .	185.2215
the smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals .	10584.926
her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black ' ' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness .	1071.5637
so he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair .	65.47958
or against her back , pressed on the column of vertebrae , which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a tulip .	2029.0743
but , to put it bluntly , nothing snapped .	4959.574
yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then .	107.002426
all martin thought he needed was time to what better use could time be put ? ?	466.6312
he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly .	1381.359
there was too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting .	994.0673
they had left themselves too much to discover .	17.496801
but , at the start , his new life felt invigorating .	30985.871
it was on the tenth day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? ?	233.74567
) that he dropped the shorts on the floor .	48.834465
`` now , i ' m not going to pick up those shorts ' ' ! !	127.771515
`` i think you ' ll get tired of them there ' ' .	15.466905
in the morning the shorts were where he had left them .	65.89086
he smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till dolores did .	6541.8076
for he had just remembered tonight they were having their first guests .	217.88594
the shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening .	654.7849
the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness , but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts .	1230.3356
they gave the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face .	1426.7317
he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous .	227.29399
i can be as stubborn as she can , he thought	218.21346
martin was standing a few feet from the front door .	26.28374
he swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away .	141.83429
he could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts .	2696.992
bill ' s hat was deposited in the hall closet .	10420.583
with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , dolores led anthea to the bedroom .	2910.9783
then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there .	165.65096
a glissade of giggles slid over their voices .	4.798291
all evening anthea favored him with odd , coy looks .	17516.72
clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word ' ' .	14.31991
for some reason , this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic .	4228.077
at last there was a void no one could fill .	652.524
martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out ' ' with dolores that night .	387.1035
but he was so taken aback , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in .	915.2635
on the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant .	1660.5112
and if he surrendered after raving at her .	75.35889
suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ?	8.124786
there was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean .	9924.773
he remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening .	657.2048
he could even recall the last time he sat there .	179.23714
she was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` afterwards martin said he was sorry .	479.81445
he apologized so sweetly , i couldn ' t keep being annoyed with him ' ' .	166.78322
it wasn ' t even true that he ' d said he was sorry that time	108.99186
he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn ' t happened , which was as honest as he could put it .	250.60884
but his mother told the story over and over , till her `` martin said he was sorry ' ' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , pallid ears .	436.20407
if the situation had been bad , it now got worse .	1216.5515
about this time people began `` dropping in ' ' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough .	159.02156
angrily martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away .	480.59756
here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by .	217.19073
these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment .	535.9628
of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts .	1524.3739
it was curious how the different visitors took this .	135.2066
some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom ' s countenance .	812.90015
to them all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale .	2204.0923
`` it ' s a little contest martin and i have ' ' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course .	661.2955
they entered the bedroom , and dolores said nothing .	69.829865
then one of the guests showed his merriment .	20.659477
`` you were in a hurry , weren ' t you ' ' ? ?	8.343013
martin would have liked to break the man ' s neck .	27.10772
now martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature .	5887.0176
with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin it ' s a little contest --	225.37605
never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment .	158.01466
they kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations .	234.57964
but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything .	32.02047
dolores kept picking up any of his clothes ( except the fatal shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions .	1029.3901
he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets , so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers .	2390.972
in his moments of worst agony , martin imagined what his friends were saying .	226.4155
he had thought her exactly what he wanted .	47.872055
six weeks of marriage and i ' m using the past tense , he told himself furiously .	1720.5535
pursuing his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now .	116.253044
day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself .	131.24486
his mind scurried frantically , seeking an exit .	12.224312
alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly , morosely , to live out his life in this fashion .	1176.5336
nothing would change , nothing would ever change .	5.7280893
when the solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before .	123.6406
in a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan .	145.36281
beside his shorts , he would place something of hers .	1072.0396
instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same .	704.1112
he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor .	1133.6073
furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts .	1078.3545
on the other hand , if she didn ' t remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment .	157.40132
martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story .	271.0971
the tale , he thought , would become less gay .	430.26675
she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness , his lack of control , his general male looseness , while she remained cool , airy , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body .	1194.3344
to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd .	1173.4381
something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and virility were involved , because it was truly his .	291.46643
the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism .	302.18332
the next morning , while dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of nylon lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts .	937.8645
in a surprisingly short time , dolores appeared .	11.867338
to his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments .	464.4635
slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second .	420.05685
ah , he thought , she ' s going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too .	934.52625
he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him .	323.2448
extending her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room .	331.9944
she did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady .	2358.4006
they breakfasted together , but martin did not refer to his triumph , and dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible .	311.10867
well , martin thought , that ' ll save .	1023.3757
as he relaxed that day , martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks .	1350.3086
he found that he no longer hated dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling .	264.28848
`` good old a-z ' ' , cap said .	32.83018
`` you know , i ' ve got one of your cars at home .	83.60031
as a prominent industrialist , you ought to be interested in his nibs ' support group .	895.9657
isn ' t his racket down your alley ' ' ? ?	2.977823
a rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot cap .	869.0729
how did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ?	899.5801
simply enough , through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law .	3107.1047
general hershey ' s draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first eminence , but fearless freddy bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time .	594.9792
freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by gerry , and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one .	1683.7476
mr . willis bought zenith plastic products , a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed freddy in an executive position .	3046.703
shortly after , freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas .	436.75
willis listened patiently , and once in a while william was exposed to them at a family gathering	959.4811
he generally heard freddy ' s suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns .	1597.9004
probably mr . willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren .	2675.4807
gerry began to aid freddy with her father , prodded , no doubt , by joan ' s open contempt for freddy and william ' s irritating competency .	2802.853
another factor must have been the eventual disposal of willis ' fortune	10033.082
she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with freddy , the more likely he was to reward freddy richly upon his death .	5715.756
they acquired another electronics factory , a specialized ceramics company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators .	7553.1206
since they were hunting for national defense contracts , adam herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections .	1297.7068
feeling his power , freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer .	2061.4482
heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him .	216.76395
the allstates auto company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism .	5862.126
cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and freddy ' s instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences .	1210.9734
with herberet ' s blessing , he was convinced that allstates ' wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind .	3516.4922
at that point william came into the picture .	30.931581
although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of zenith .	4387.7583
freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure	470.60065
and if he wasn ' t entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities .	242.82431
mr . willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and william set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to wisconsin and washington .	232.4194
in the end , he said `` i ' m not enchanted by the proposition , sir .	309.41193
i know a guy named jack hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with chrysler , and i took him with me to allstates .	477.57428
it ' s his expert opinion that the plant isn ' t well suited to what you have in mind .	147.97554
besides that , i ' m acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the air force .	280.50244
i think adam herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side .	1120.3374
missiles have thrown everything up for grabs , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here .	98.48257
the future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade -- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes .	2221.2234
this means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough .	581.81067
here are a few facts and figures i ' ve assembled .	252.59727
can ' t you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles ' ' ? ?	309.54416
willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .	3245.38
`` well ' ' , he said , `` there is freddy , you know .	390.20786
freddy is deeply committed to our plans already .	62.499077
he assures me he has people to handle the money raising , and ham richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of zenith and allstates are no problem .	1581.8898
i don ' t like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man ' s caution ' ' .	313.41092
i wish you wouldn ' t tell freddy i ' m lukewarm	621.75653
i ' ve caused him trouble before , and he ' s beginning to resent me .	67.19277
if we don ' t take care , the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides , brandishing their cudgels ' ' .	1352.4009
`` which is a frightful prospect , bill ' ' .	7.0522323
`` one shouldn ' t mix commercial affairs with patriarchy , but in this case i have no choice .	250.65271
i ' m most grateful to you , so grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy ' ' .	1486.3867
allied to them was gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further .	1260.3887
zenith absorbed allstates , stock transfers were arranged , and freddy became president of the hyphenated combination .	1681.3574
through jack hamrick , william fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for shoals and clay .	1469.2968
he forgot about a-z till , unhappily , he and hamrick were proved correct .	7088.4395
freddy ' s backing dropped away from him and mr . willis was forced to make up the deficit .	223.31017
adam , beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn ' t deliver from his end .	226.39014
the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant .	10570.672
stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value .	723.7196
confronted by a grim future , freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation .	1328.2968
`` you were right ' ' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and i ' m in something of a bind .	87.86168
freddy ' s solution doesn ' t appeal to me .	6.2925296
in addition to other defects , i ' m a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment .	891.0796
will you see if you can help me ' ' ? ?	3.4339812
his recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of a-z ' s useless wisconsin set-up , exposure to exciting conceptions of hamrick ' s that nobody would buy , and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called ticonderoga motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it .	2904.1333
initially , hamrick ' s reaction to a-z going into the passenger car market was discouraging .	462.31705
he thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult .	459.49777
if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if william could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money hurdle was not insurmountable .	2400.371
they took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white .	545.98676
taking hamrick with him , william went to mr . willis .	3972.9067
he was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report .	134.64648
`` your alternative is breathtaking ' ' , he said , `` and , i ' m frank in saying , a bit mad .	127.853294
i wish i was younger and less timid .	8.337046
well , i can ' t resolve this myself .	177.13393
i ' ll have to call in the brain trust .	901.25275
are you willing to run the gantlet ? ?	1.0490402
i can ' t guarantee you a sympathetic audience ' ' .	13.747635
`` we ' ll be in there swinging ' ' , william said , `` but in a way , sir , you ' ve got to decide it yourself .	79.72342
you have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage .	148.33052
if they follow anyone , it ' ll have to be you ' ' .	17.92635
`` i should explain there ' s more here for me than advocating my little dream , there ' s you .	758.4574
you mustn ' t take a fall , or publicly back away .	1192.9979
forgive the hearts and flowers theme ' ' .	1.7541245
`` i rather like the music ' ' , willis replied quietly .	11217.578
at the meeting , attended by freddy , richert , herberet and the a-z executive staff , with mr . willis presiding , william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet .	9741.419
from shock and incredulity , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity .	1266.7072
`` oh , my god ' ' , ham richert said , `` a little child shall lead them .	2511.1104
`` it ' s absurd , bill ' ' , freddy said , from a pale face .	676.764
`` you ' re leading dad down the garden path ' ' .	107.15786
`` your garden , god damn it ' ' ! !	7.250825
`` i don ' t enjoy family quarrels ' ' , adam said .	55.846954
can ' t we put an end to this , arthur ' ' ? ?	78.627335
`` hear me out , please ' ' , william begged .	364.52527
`` i ' m an advertising hustler , i admit , but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere .	173.93022
sure , ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big three .	3648.0017
their cars weren ' t small enough , they didn ' t have the power , they were old-fashioned .	79.49224
they tried to sell ' em on economy and simple merit .	734.27124
we ' ve arrived at an age for romance and snobbery .	5450.3887
we ' ve all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age .	583.9661
look what those little european jobs are doing .	14.137941
we ' ll woo the consumer with a product , not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight .	3409.7446
let ' s make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates .	719.17413
ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , ready-made .	896.94885
we ' ve got rid of the steam yachts and georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next .	4648.047
why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an allstates-zenith ' ' ? ?	201.14702
he swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on .	3359.4277
mr . willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum .	645.23895
`` nobody will underwrite it , i ' m telling you ' ' , freddy said .	342.76718
`` i know what i ' m talking about in that department ' ' .	79.779205
`` there ' s plenty of risk money ' ' , ham richert added , `` but not for anything this risky ' ' .	631.4613
`` all right ' ' , william said .	143.60806
`` we ' ll try to swing the deal on that basis .	597.3381
if we can ' t raise the capital , we ' re through .	111.76823
why won ' t you give me a chance ' ' ? ?	11.176881
he smiled at william and slowly rubbed his hands together .	88.98464
`` i feel i must answer the question ' ' , he said , `` since the onus later , if any , should fall on me -- i don ' t relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family .	418.8705
i ' m not giving you a chance , bill , but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance .	1424.8872
`` all the in-laws have got to have their day ' ' , adam said , and glared at william and freddy in turn .	916.89325
sweat started out on william ' s forehead , whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell .	2721.1846
across the table , hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger .	18405.469
spike-haired , burly , red-faced , decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an ivy league suit , jack hamrick awaited william at the officers ' club .	4543.234
`` hello , boss ' ' , he said , and grinned .	59.424427
`` i suppose i can never expect to call you ' general ' after that washington episode ' ' .	471.6749
it was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco ! !	6595.82
for it seems that barco , fancying himself a ladies ' man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? ?	681.58875
) , had listed himself for mormon beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said `` with your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies ' ' ! !	364.4521
mills secured barco ' s photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of cal barco .	926.79974
on their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants .	2230.3223
finally , at ye olde gasse filling station on avocado avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to san diego .	682.08167
at the moment , barco ' s back was to the road so he didn ' t see the detectives close in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search .	434.57788
the robe , however , was missing , for by that time barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in glendale .	2622.4314
the detectives placed barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to hollywood for questioning .	307.54648
thus it was that barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered .	628.7416
during the return trip , barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as `` they ' re under sand dunes they ' re better off , i tell you i saved their souls ' ' .	350.1649
the detective , commenting on barco ' s behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged -- that he was a more or less harmless `` nut ' ' ! !	421.02057
however while in his cell awaiting trial for theft , barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life .	366.4528
the attempt had failed because , when endeavoring to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood .	1152.8337
the jail authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered barco whisky to revive him	6773.777
but the old fellow , a lifelong teetotaler , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter .	90.14939
then it was that district attorney welch entered the case .	82.96951
a man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of los angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity .	1286.2599
it was reported to welch ' s office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide .	733.24603
now welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at .	720.68976
the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test .	55.756405
so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly	2328.9346
`` barco , we ' ve got the goods on you ! !	294.3989
it ' ll be a lot better if you come clean ' ' .	45.079197
but with welch ' s relentless pursuit of the subject , barco finally `` broke ' ' and started confessing to one murder after another .	1247.8092
by the time barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true .	745.9356
but if true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great murder trial .	436.2461
welch summoned jail officials to barco ' s cell .	588.0601
but to welch ' s chagrin , the police captain pooh-poohed welch ' s credulity in barco ' s confession .	15064.255
barco was clearly a `` nut ' ' .	13.350718
it required strength , bravado , daring to commit murder .	1922.8375
then , for the first time since his arrest , a glint of spirit lit barco ' s eyes .	3530.8142
`` well , for ten years i ' ve been murdering women .	801.81445
i can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain ' t four , nor five , nor six of ' em -- there ' s seven ! !	306.06888
the next day the police captain , in derision , organized what he termed `` welch ' s wild goose chase ' ' .	2269.2957
for indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in hollywood .	531.55994
the searching party consisted of the police captain , welch , barco , policemen with shovels , newspaper reporters , and cameramen .	12200.08
barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on .	1474.816
he directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica .	407.66455
stopping the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicated a location .	857.2461
the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again barco ' s pride was aroused .	200.71414
with greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left .	207.0625
with quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging .	9592.405
the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object .	492.3128
`` there ' s something here ' ' ! !	27.205154
the digger , thrusting about with his shovel , now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer ' s hollywood sport shirts .	2497.7554
although it was a mere fragment of the victim ' s remains , it was enough .	66.8376
his elation grew as barco ' s seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another .	2167.0205
now did welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph for him .	142.49776
it went to his head , and his ambition increased .	1445.2412
it was apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his power as d . a . to drag every possible sensation into the case .	440.2752
every new scandal which would provide more `` copy ' ' for marshall ' s pen would thus mean more publicity for welch .	517.658
i knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand .	931.8977
once there , the d . a . with devilish cleverness would provide marshall with headlines `` viola ' s multiple romances ' ' `` viola lake an addict ' ' `` downfall of another film idol ' ' ! !	6017.5327
it would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor ' s throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl ! !	278.62296
i studied welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted .	522.6079
it wasn ' t long before i sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for viola ' s destruction .	869.4725
a dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward viola ' s favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap .	906.2932
i did not rest until i had tracked the mystery down .	1459.6663
one day over a year before , there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel .	60.868977
viola had been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone .	166.968
she arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority	436.75977
the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor .	455.67264
naturally , viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn ' t leave so soon after her arrival , in all politeness to her host .	216.58871
and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds	1076.9413
while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as fate would have it , belonged to district attorney welch .	1104.3291
as viola sat there , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes .	3287.5552
a little later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture forum on `` the civic spirit of the southland ' ' , in the byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to preside .	414.57687
he made his way to his host ' s bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed .	820.9542
then , noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds , he made his way to the byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the rostrum .	1238.5284
the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined .	264.5371
the incident , aside from reflecting on welch ' s political career , had all but wrecked his home life .	146.58292
he never rested until he discovered who the culprit was , and when he did , he vowed vengeance on viola lake if ever the chance came his way .	1338.6989
by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion .	84.64415
during these first days of the trial i didn ' t have as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have liked .	647.31604
in the first place , it was difficult for us to meet .	88.19909
we couldn ' t be seen together , for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent .	376.86722
i couldn ' t invite viola to our house , for mother snobbishly refused to receive her .	2169.9675
now the czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of los angeles-pasadena society to her .	1595.8605
there , mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ) .	4564.279
i hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats .	4302.395
but mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts .	3240.5273
in fact , it was not until the king of spain had visited at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi .	3715.9065
mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school .	968.9048
but at long last came a time when i broke away from mother and her society `` chi-chi ' ' in order to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home .	1213.9595
however , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , society , and even , alas , to my own mother .	170.35014
when i arrived at viola ' s i was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen .	216.19374
viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook ' s night out and that she herself was preparing dinner .	388.78632
there was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by viola herself .	8732.052
i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater .	757.8352
the most that was accomplished was adding mrs . beige ' s tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion .	394.52673
i was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly .	1707.6973
here ' s a household hint if you can ' t find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone .	143.35402
no matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick up the phone .	424.61414
louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency .	377.4996
somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` won ' t you hold on a second , please ' ' , i covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including devil ' s island and the remoter reaches of siberia .	607.6603
i promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed .	570.63306
speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , i resumed my everyday voice .	3889.8713
soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like jennie ' s holding her breath and pretending to black out , miranda ' s dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles .	1277.1292
under the circumstances , i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that hank and i be there .	448.92972
i discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room .	112.50371
it seemed that i would be the gainer if i accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats .	570.57
resolving to get something done , i started in on the dishes .	161.94333
what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink .	394.01047
they looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that i found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again , this time about francesca and her husband .	1154.5419
francesca and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia .	3800.6904
we didn ' t even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after i met fran at a pta meeting , and had taken us in hand socially .	468.4417
they had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since catatonia was just a village	551.411
the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly thin ) .	6319.951
herb , an expert on narrow ties , thin lapels , and swatches , was men ' s fashion editor of parvenu , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation .	1849.532
fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from nebraska , or was it wyoming ? ?	513.3382
she was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and , having arrived in new york with a big bank roll , became a dabbler in various fields .	1117.3866
she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile , then put some money into a broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful ) .	411.88507
it was during her `` writing ' ' period that she and herb met and decided that they were in love .	768.21796
they were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they honeymooned in bermuda .	1601.0701
everyone was very high on rome that year .	12.544102
they had bought their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding new york	5305.0483
they had chosen catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names .	249.44261
`` you are bound to get involved with people when you have children ' ' , fran had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but people who do things ' ' .	327.96338
i admired their easy way of doing things but i couldn ' t escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things .	219.62132
their house was a centuries-old colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and updated , and added on to .	1065.6124
it had a gourmet ' s corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud .	257.62207
it was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time .	230.15756
their two boys were `` well adjusted ' ' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences .	275.57104
francesca and herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) .	558.98456
fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by wearing bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in colors	25105.668
sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid , unrelieved black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the ss . .	827.32166
no one could dislike them , i thought .	25.824574
sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human .	525.0758
it seemed , indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement .	321.72186
practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names ' '	78.99343
you should hear the reverence in fran ' s voice when she said `` baccarat ' ' or `` steuben ' ' or `` madame alexander ' ' .	147.27428
she always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy , and that koussevitzky ' s second cousin was an intimate of theirs .	541.5565
i wouldn ' t have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia were equally unreal .	1333.7772
i couldn ' t feel at home among them .	26.563883
francesca was pleasant and charming , but blanche was sweet .	470.35184
yes , blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being drowned in warm , melted marshmallows .	2536.585
i had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness , `` oh , my souffle has collapsed ' ' .	1263.9661
anyone knows how a real , red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe ! !	555.13165
if blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , valueless things .	852.4208
after five minutes with blanche , one might welcome the astringency of grazie , who was a sort of gwen cafritz to francesca ' s perle mesta .	17533.553
francesca and grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever pta or civic project was being launched .	3538.7803
they were inseparable , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen rivals for social leadership .	296.1322
she it was who had looked to see if i was wearing shoes upon learning that i couldn ' t drive .	233.675
grazie had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast .	544.4051
she lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring	1087.6483
the pets were a couple of siamese cats .	3.0259967
her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , housepaint , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick .	701.24036
the husbands of these women and others i had met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were , to me at least , indistinguishable .	804.4562
i couldn ' t tell one from the other .	288.00592
like herbert , they were all in communications radio , television , magazines , and advertising .	341.1485
each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of saying `` zounds ' ' ! !	408.65207
i never thought i ' d live to hear people chuckle and say `` zounds ' ' ! !	784.7025
i wouldn ' t have missed it for anything .	216.80746
they were `` sincere ' ' -- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile .	1656.3074
these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , misty-eyed with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting .	778.1019
could such unadulterated love , for a total stranger , be credited ? ?	1730.1107
they were always leaping to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and i mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that i mistrusted bake shops that called themselves `` sanitary bake shops ' ' .	1774.3843
' ' i thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier	10498.587
pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` mister ' ' .	982.90356
i sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85 , 000 yearly	167.54214
people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` person to person ' '	159.35268
people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice	264.64697
who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons .	385.30484
well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` kafka ' ' ! !	185.45685
reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about kafka , not having read kafka .	952.11554
they were , i felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were .	173.89009
becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , i brought myself back to the tasks at hand .	147.08922
i made plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen .	344.9989
then , i remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week .	273.4989
they ' re just something you ' re supposed to put on cereal for breakfast ' ' .	170.35364
i dug around and found a mix , and was able to surprise them with a devil ' s-food cake with chocolate icing .	2622.4878
( sometimes i think you need only one rule for cooking if you can ' t put garlic in it , put chocolate in it .	499.2346
the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing .	1310.3019
then jennie closed her eyes , stretched forth her arms , and said `` take my hand , louise	554.4211
i ' m a stranger in paradise ' ' .	1.8674779
needless to say , i was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise .	7907.077
how dared they demand to `` snoop ' ' in private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements ? ?	3150.09
`` it is as though ' ' , i said on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio broadcast which i bought ( following father coughlin and pre-empting the eddie cantor , manhattan merry-go-round and major bowes shows ) `` that man in the white house , like some despot of yore , insisted on reading my diary , raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie ! !	7725.56
' ' my impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the eddie cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis .	3069.896
but what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ? ?	550.664
the savage barbarian hordes of red russian communism descended on the athens that was mighty metronome , sacking and despoiling with their bolshevistic battle cry of `` soak the rich ' ! !	5158.671
after an unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed ' ' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while i , who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earned and the little i legally inherited as morris ' helpless relict , was `` stung ' ' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out ' ' all but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings .	658.1057
i was also publicly reprimanded , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as the new republic , the new yorker , time and the christian science monitor .	699.151
it was then that i availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional .	788.82135
i fought like a tigress but by the time i appealed my case to the supreme court ( 1937 ) , mr . roosevelt and his `` henchmen ' ' had done their `` dirty work ' ' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack ' ' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me .	259.84238
presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers , `` toadies ' ' and sycophants of the `` bench ' ' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! !	400.59268
i was ready , like portia , to present my own brief .	1935.2231
but the supreme court wouldn ' t even hear my case ! !	1283.4606
my plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out ' ' .	28.122522
again , my name was on all the front pages .	1668.1227
i was , it seemed , persona non grata in every quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence .	4512.661
as charles evans hughes said , `` miss poitrine ' s limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant ' ' .	1391.901
albert einstein was quoted as saying `` the workings of the woman ' s mind amaze me ' ' .	144.75198
henry ford spoke of me as `` utterly astounding ' ' .	61.73152
heywood broun wrote `` belle poitrine is the most original thinker since caligula ' ' , and even f . d . r . had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of miss poitrine , america would rapidly resemble ancient babylon and nineveh ' ' .	909.12994
not only were the court costs prohibitive , but i was subjected to crippling fines , in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts ' ' which the government claimed that metronome and i owed -- a severe financial blow .	694.18427
nor , as manny said , had the notoriety done my career `` any good ' ' .	1080.0078
my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary ' ' , `` robber baroness ' ' , and even `` traitor ' ' ! !	360.31003
i point now with pride to the fact that , long ere the committee on un-american activities , the minute women , the economic council and other such notable `` watchdog ' ' organizations were so much as heard of , i was hollywood ' s leading bulwark against communism , fighting single-handedly `` creeping socialism ' ' against such insuperable odds as the fascio-communist troops of the nra , pwa , wpa , ccc and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom f . d . r . employed secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular `` relief ' ' checks .	1533.928
needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period .	241.66344
even though i have always had a genius for `` throwing myself ' ' into every role and `` playing it for all it ' s worth ' ' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled .	481.07513
such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to `` oscar ' ' winning performances .	264.8059
i tried my hardest , with little help , may i say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe .	455.7661
having ( through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieved stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote , letch proceeded to neglect them all .	2090.6172
never a `` quick study ' ' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines ' ' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because miss poitrine ' s co-star and `` helpmate ' ' had never learned his part .	773.5107
each time letch `` went up ' ' in his `` lines ' ' , i was the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blaming others , going into `` sulks ' ' and , on more occasions than i care to count , storming off the `` set ' ' for the rest of the day .	378.4115
as for his finances , i was never privileged to know exactly how much money letch had `` salted away ' ' .	1137.9205
it was i who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even letch ' s bills at his tailor and the los angeles athletic club .	486.90793
never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw .	900.43536
) as for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing .	9287.042
more than once i was confronted by professional gamblers , `` bookies ' ' , loan `` sharks ' ' , gangsters , `` thugs ' ' and `` finger men ' ' -- people of a class i did not even know existed -- to repay my husband ' s staggering losses , `` or else ' ' i shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu .	573.16406
and at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that letch had sired their unborn children ! !	6193.806
having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when i thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven ' ' i would have proudly given my husband .	1008.6783
`` ah , you ' re too old ' ' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever i suggested `` starting a family ' ' .	1140.467
letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter .	148.46115
i now felt it wiser to keep baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the society of friends all year around .	514.2253
her presence only made letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying chateau belletch , i had neglected to consider a room for baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow .	1366.3181
( i sometimes feel that god , in his infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory .	1193.3586
it almost always works out for the best .	19.45488
yet i adored this man , letch feeley , why , i cannot say .	81.58712
with faint heart and a brave smile , i endured his long absences from chateau belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse .	7578.8223
the times i can recall when i was publicly humiliated by him -- lovely dinner parties in our trianon suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host ' s chair was vacant	3245.7202
a `` splash party ' ' at the new pool , which i had built in the hope of keeping letch away from public beaches , when letch and a certain aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour	1238.1636
a lovely epiphany party at errol flynn ' s , on which sacred occasion letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet ' ' , leaving me `` high and dry ' ' to get home as best i could .	834.6119
these are but a sampling of the insults i endured .	1365.657
as mrs . letch feeley , was it any wonder that i , once the social arbiter of filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the astaires , the coopers , the gables , the colmans , the rathbones , the taylors , the thalbergs and such devout , closely knit families as the barrymores and the crosbys ? ?	2499.5068
as letch ' s antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable `` screenland ' ' gathering .	1919.1608
between 1935 and 1939 letch and i made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it .	1452.3
our last joint venture , sainted lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of america ' s first saint in november , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish .	672.41724
as i was playing mother cabrini , the picture was actually `` all mine ' ' , with nearly every scene built around me .	243.2285
but in order to keep letch in the public eye and out of trouble , i wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light ' ' and is saved by the inspiring example of mother cabrini .	353.29196
and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? ?	47.09523
did he trouble to memorize the very small part which i had `` tailor-made ' ' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? ?	380.28967
did he show the rest of the cast -- numbering four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio punctually -- or even at all ? ?	989.7509
the `` shooting ' ' went on for eight months ! !	243.06178
most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` bookies ' ' , illegal gambling dens , a certain `` residential club for young actresses ' ' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club .	912.4332
whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over ' ' , uncooperative , rude and insulting .	1022.64545
he made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general .	255.66989
by the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini .	3450.6057
thanks to letch feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable .	1317.7054
only george santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote `` miss poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleashed by hollywood ' ' .	729.2254
in a rare fit of anger and spite , i `` farmed out ' ' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment .	504.5039
) the film was called the diet of worms , which i felt was just what letch deserved .	1721.3026
it turned out to be a life of martin luther , of all things ! !	166.13593
in clothes , letch simply did not project .	12.832573
at the same time , however , i availed myself of the services of that great english actor and master of make-up , sir gauntley pratt , to do a `` quickie ' ' called the mystery of the mad marquess , in which i played a young american girl who inherits a haunted castle on the english moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac .	1773.749
it was a `` potboiler ' ' made on a `` shoestring ' ' and not the sort of film i like , as all i had to do was look blank and scream a great deal .	338.39764
my heart was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most financially successful picture of my career .	442.13898
( i watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up ' ' remarkably well , even twenty years later .	212.27742
letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before .	1255.4994
i really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person letch had once been , i took my troubles to momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me .	1199.5681
`` if i could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy ' ' , i said .	428.19794
`` what is letch interested in ' ' ? ?	8.948071
`` bookies , booze and babes ' ' , momma said bluntly .	14217.843
her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference .	898.5139
`` i can ' t turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon ' ' , i said .	204.44093
up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn ' t even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn ' t found it .	188.89015
it wasn ' t his fault that these things were so .	79.14085
the difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately .	975.87885
as a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready .	1784.3096
once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted .	1150.48
then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs .	210.60587
he had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams .	232.77533
then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws .	4406.419
dogs did something to one ' s ego .	3.7184298
they were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world ' s great guys .	64.24516
regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference .	144.79292
now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture .	57.724525
what in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons ? ?	348.73972
you certainly couldn ' t take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns .	349.68054
why in the world couldn ' t he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? ?	248.28265
it worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day .	92.726295
he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it .	409.28568
how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case ? ?	550.19836
was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? ?	182.29504
could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? ?	447.46323
did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? ?	320.76538
did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ? ?	1350.3544
it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes .	1811.8838
perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it .	577.8479
and then again perhaps the reason why he couldn ' t find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn ' t want to do them .	186.37437
they could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn .	8037.227
during all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done .	251.80981
this habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting .	158.16475
he looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch .	5333.4
on some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered .	477.72577
he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn .	392.49234
at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop .	195.68971
he went down to mills and bradley ' s hardware store and bought a full set of carpenter ' s tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr . mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were .	511.90234
he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for .	1191.0159
`` there ' ' , said mr . mills .	219.59683
add things as you find you need ' em ' ' .	20.44148
he didn ' t even ask the cost of this collection .	65.12681
after all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that .	301.7515
when he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car .	554.48663
it gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments .	421.34113
he had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable .	418.40024
he piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall .	497.1109
that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools .	218.10474
in front of it would be his workbench .	4.7186685
the old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he couldn ' t pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away .	1015.69495
how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? ?	1160.868
how did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? ?	71.57581
after the pegboard there would be the paneling .	42.533947
he sat down on an old box and focused on the problem .	170.57132
perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget .	220.47617
but then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn ' t they come right out again ? ?	124.02128
perhaps that was the first thing to do .	46.926487
a workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn ' t wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ?	641.03754
mr . mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench .	662.82245
they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile .	9399.993
mr . crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .	112.44879
how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? ?	3220.2285
perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about .	1424.4973
then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on .	236.39873
mr . crumb was laid up with a bad cold .	279.24863
he didn ' t seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly .	1132.4393
the only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job .	227.7149
that was why he hadn ' t been able to finish the porch .	132.48524
no , he didn ' t know of any handyman-carpenter .	29290.26
there wasn ' t any such thing any more .	82.9436
carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother ' s son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job .	664.4499
there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way .	739.5888
nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk .	93.809975
mr . crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting the next night .	818.2517
if he was sober , which was doubtful , he ' d have him get in touch with mr . crombie .	316.47375
mr . blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into mr . crombie ' s life since he moved to highfield , in spite of the fact that he didn ' t work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn ' t like to work at all unless mr . crombie hung around and talked to him .	243.77864
he said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn ' t nobody with you .	384.08957
so mr . crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr . blatz ' s mind from funny things .	462.7851
at the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but mr . blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn ' t like to disclose his ignorance .	733.59814
while mr . blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , mr . crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar .	1970.8887
mr . blatz agreed that this would be pretty .	979.0086
without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste .	693.65753
`` now ' ' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets for them power tools	428.1075
then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an ' i guess we ' re about through down here ' ' .	1252.0762
it all did look very efficient and shipshape .	3.310594
`` by the way ' ' , said mr . blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage .	3698.9246
before you use ' em the light company ' s got to run in a heavy line and you ' ll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits .	233.05708
that ain ' t too bad ' ceptin ' the light company ' s so busy you can ' t ever get ' em to do nothin ' ' ' .	357.16116
instead of being depressed by this news , mr . crombie was actually relieved .	1406.7793
at least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools .	98.77626
he followed mr . blatz up the cellar stairs .	6311.2417
as usual , mrs . crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils .	111.82121
`` well ' ' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there .	1530.4918
he oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions ' ' .	552.44165
mr . crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression .	5627.909
`` i was just sayin ' to him that i ' m all ready now for anything else you want done ' ' .	101.80646
mr . crombie couldn ' t remember his saying any such thing .	381.50565
`` oh , that ' s wonderful ' ' , cried mrs . crombie .	2328.0708
`` i have a thousand things for you to do .	73.23776
doors that won ' t open , and doors that won ' t close and shelves and broken -- ' '	402.26416
`` but those are the things i built the workshop for ' ' , protested mr . crombie .	1095.3523
`` those are the things i can do , now that i ' m set up ' ' .	32.96046
`` i ' ve been waiting to get these things done for months ' ' , she said .	85.14096
`` we won ' t live long enough if i wait for you , besides which you don ' t need to worry -- there ' ll be plenty more ' ' .	96.189156
mr . blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink .	1427.2653
nothing in english has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences .	256.02408
ben franklin said , `` clearly spoken , mr . fogg .	78.00875
richard brinsley sheridan said , `` i think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two ' ' .	107.796364
and a witty american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can ' t understand his own meaning ' ' .	166.79413
there are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies .	1540.7175
in common parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds .	46219.48
`` did you or did you not say what i said you said , because jane said you never said what i said ' ' ? ?	218.21313
another woman , addressing christmas cards , said to her husband `` we sent them one last year but they didn ' t send us one , so they probably won ' t send us one this year because they ' ll think we won ' t send them one because they didn ' t last year , don ' t you think , or shall we ' ' ? ?	119.109825
such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours .	3258.43
ambiguity of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in .	2906.3943
`` i ' m terribly upset ' ' , she told a girl-friend .	1162.0211
`` i wrote bill in my last letter to forget that i had told him that i didn ' t mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me ' ' .	79.55724
evidently bill was another of those men who simply don ' t understand women .	290.46136
another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician .	163.17946
`` mr . jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement .	1181.2645
now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it ' ' ? ?	172.47961
questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician .	780.0199
they recall byron ' s classic comment `` i wish he would explain his explanation ' ' .	258.1059
similarly , when a reporter once questioned lincoln in cryptic fashion , lincoln refused to make any further statement .	884.0958
`` i fear explanations explanatory of things explained ' ' , he said , leaving the biter bit -- and bitter .	449.81598
the obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks .	307.56747
`` senator ' ' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can ' t understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question ' ' .	151.85416
`` it took me five hours to write it that way ' ' .	25.363054
the misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach .	650.218
this creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word .	204.24051
a verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain `` i saw a man once beat his wife when on a drunken spree .	1894.9856
now can you tell me who was drunk -- the man , his wife , or me ' ' ? ?	29.757072
the `` wooden-leg ' ' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations .	1177.0757
`` there ' s a man outside with a wooden leg named smith ' ' .	394.20462
`` what ' s the name of his other leg ' ' ? ?	109.42627
another stock vaudeville gag ran `` mother is home sick in bed with the doctor ' ' .	205.15361
when radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device .	3391.9941
`` do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on ' ' ? ?	253.07146
`` i see the girl but i don ' t see the car with slacks on ' ' .	138.9456
in recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline .	4901.555
in one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman `` excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter ' s handbag and my wife ' s behind ' ' .	185.76228
journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips .	1148.0518
not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than af inches ' ' .	430.43585
classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions .	4.121452
readers of the reader ' s digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a california paper that advertised `` house for rent .	976.6544
view takes in five counties , two bedrooms ' ' .	14.54075
since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples .	4439.044
son and daughter of local couple married ' ' .	2.4368699
apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter .	975.38336
a weekly newspaper reported a local romance `` and the couple were married last saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays ' ' .	923.1605
an item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding `` i personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband ' ' .	284.89307
then there was the caterer ' s ad which read `` are you getting married or having an affair ? ?	342.6322
we have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people ' ' .	6.872369
the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical .	588.3964
this slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous english always seems to refer to a person ' s anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say .	259.7085
in news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs .	275.62454
`` while henry morgan was escorting miss vera green from the church social last saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit mr . morgan on the public square ' ' .	365.3555
such items recall the california journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star `` the area in which miss n -- was injured is spectacularly scenic ' ' .	1242.7601
the double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of weber and fields .	2629.8308
when a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` no , it was in the stomach ' ' .	136.57956
strangely enough , this always brought the house down .	269.07657
apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature .	1915.2014
a conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor .	1611.324
her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor ' s notes on an emergency case .	131.63914
it read `` shot in the lumbar region ' ' .	7.020895
after a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record `` shot in the woods ' ' .	204.47906
there are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations .	7079.8525
at the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving .	742.1996
`` i want the fish served whole , with head and tail ' ' , the epicure explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth ' ' .	322.307
`` that ' s silly -- lemon in mouth ' ' , she said .	39.354546
but since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners , the girl reluctantly agreed .	552.1461
so she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth .	233.97572
another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store .	123.41165
she said to the saleslady , `` i want a dress to put on around the house ' ' .	62.44674
the puzzled saleslady inquired , `` how large is your house , madam ' ' ? ?	359.5521
this saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department .	550.66766
when a customer asked for alligator shoes , she said , `` what size is your alligator ' ' ? ?	179.8334
the comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy .	1394.6455
one species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing .	1136.3665
a woman met a famous author at a literary tea .	1165.5929
`` oh , i ' m so delighted to meet you ' ' , she gushed .	94.16133
`` it was only the other day that i saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine ' ' .	372.27893
this baffling lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence .	654.5143
`` i may be back ' ' , he explained , `` and then again , i may not ' ' .	25.7524
`` yes , sir ' ' , she said , `` is that definite ' ' ? ?	37.49809
an old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter , `` you must have gotten in quite late last night , dear .	268.45346
the daughter replied , `` oh , i had dinner with -- well , you don ' t know him but he ' s awfully nice -- and we went to a couple of places -- i don ' t suppose you ' ve heard of them -- and we finished up at a cute little night club -- i forget the name of it .	165.51933
why , it ' s all right , isn ' t it , mother ' ' ? ?	31.847828
`` of course , dear ' ' , she said .	32.858624
`` it ' s only that i like to know where you go ' ' .	25.74346
no less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman ' s sermon .	1003.22296
`` dearly beloved ' ' , he preached , `` unless you repent of your sins in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , i regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent ' ' .	238.2519
this clergyman should have referred to shakespeare ' s dictum `` so-so is a good , very good , very excellent maxim .	1384.55
indefinite reference also carries double-meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another .	279.516
a news item described the launching of a ship `` completing the ceremony , the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea ' ' .	1458.6427
this is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool `` four trucks to fort mason gym , 7 30 tonight , for hauling girls to dance .	1343.8569
the bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off ' ' .	9.898344
a politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died .	152.28032
`` what are my chances for taking joe ' s place ' ' ? ?	14.076472
`` if you can fix it up with the undertaker ' ' , returned the politician , `` it ' s all right with me ' ' .	91.712494
the manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite .	615.701
`` what have you got on today ' ' ? ?	2.4874148
`` a blue suit ' ' , he answered .	136.11308
`` who ' s in it ' ' ? ?	6.582226
`` i am ' ' , he said .	10.399622
`` oh ' ' , said the woman , `` i ' ve seen that picture already ' ' .	42.180115
another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb .	231.60274
when a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered .	200.48457
the moonlit night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time .	325.34103
finally he asked , `` do you object to petting ' ' ? ?	89.3561
`` that ' s one thing i ' ve never done ' ' , she said promptly .	46.205933
he thought a moment , then inquired , `` you mean petted ' ' ? ?	184.72289
`` no ' ' , she smiled , `` objected ' ' .	33.17026
replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre .	6871.714
it would be hard to find anything more equivocal than `` i cannot recommend him too highly ' ' .	967.42334
another less ambiguous case read as follows `` the bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction .	404.08975
if you are thinking of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one ' ' .	185.8428
in the comedy of indefinite reference , it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence .	2337.6396
ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference .	9850.779
one said , `` when i get a cold i buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a few hours it ' s gone ' ' .	139.2464
the speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold .	469.4231
it-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit .	262.43564
an excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone `` doctor , please come over right away .	345.36215
i called the other afternoon on my old friend , graves moreland , the anglo-american literary critic -- his mother was born in ohio -- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the upson downs , raising hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor .	1357.6667
my unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind .	214.27576
after gagarin became the greatest man in the world , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism , moreland wrote me a letter in which he said `` i am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly .	258.86737
a bee ' s place is in the hive ' ' .	234.72084
`` i have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy ' ' , i told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand .	196.43584
`` i seem to remember ' ' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live .	243.06596
did you go to their funeral ' ' ? ?	5.665215
`` i was wrong ' ' , i admitted .	594.282
`` comedy didn ' t die , it just went crazy .	9494.285
it has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate .	580.6148
we now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes , magazines known as horror comics , and sick comedians .	4085.529
there are even publications called sick and mad .	10.017367
the zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a march hare	4794.124
it is manic as a man ' ' .	2.262231
`` i woke up this morning ' ' , moreland said , `` paraphrasing lewis carroll .	7180.2627
do you want to hear the paraphrase ' ' ? ?	7.1777835
`` can i bear it ' ' ? ?	1.0470663
i asked , taking a final gulp of my drink , and handing him the empty glass .	154.1772
`` just barely ' ' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase `` the time has come ' ' , the walrus said , `` to speak of manic things , of shots and shouts , and sealing dooms of commoners and kings ' ' .	1799.5282
moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` for god ' s sake , tell me something truly amusing ' ' .	84.099174
`` i ' ll try ' ' , i said , and sat for a moment thinking .	193.1169
`` oh yes , the other day i reread some of emerson ' s english traits , and there was an anecdote about a group of english and americans visiting germany , more than a hundred years ago .	228.71245
in the railway station at berlin , a uniformed attendant was chanting , ' foreigners this way ! !	1595.398
one woman -- she could have been either english or american -- went up to him and said , ' but you are the foreigners ' ' ' .	372.81152
i took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` i admit that going back to ralph waldo emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy ' ' .	403.0896
`` what ' s the matter with the music ' ' ? ?	36.4611
`` it doesn ' t drown out the dialogue ' ' , i explained .	87.79434
`` let ' s talk about books ' ' , moreland said .	324.15424
`` i am told that in america you have non-books by non-writers , brought out by non-publishers for non-readers .	28909.895
`` there is non-fiction and non non-fiction ' ' , i said .	17.654514
`` speaking of nonism the other day , in a story about a sit-down demonstration , the paris herald tribune wrote , ' the non-violence became noisier .	1369.7662
and then eichmann was quoted as saying , in non-english , that hitler ' s plan to exterminate the jews was nonsense ' ' .	454.2196
`` if we cannot tell evil , horror , and insanity from nonsense , what is the future of humor and comedy ' ' ? ?	92.97596
`` they require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? ?	283.7786
in our present era of science and angst , the heart has been downgraded , to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs ' ' .	462.5378
`` i know what you mean ' ' , moreland sighed .	42578.605
`` last year your tennessee williams told our dilys powell , in a television program , that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart .	458.97705
like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged glands , and the jumpy central nervous system .	915.69086
i ' m not pleading for the heart that leaps up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with rapture fills and dances with the daffodils .	3917.069
the sentimental pure heart of galahad is gone with the knightly years , but i still believe in the heart of the george meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks ' ' .	235.30984
`` we no longer have tom moore ' s and longfellow ' s ' heart for any fate ' , either ' ' , i said .	135.9766
`` moore and longfellow didn ' t have the fate that faces us ' ' , moreland said .	459.00723
`` one day our species promises co-existence , and the next day it threatens co-extinction ' ' .	678.1993
we sat for a while drinking in silence .	4.0489726
`` the heart ' ' , i said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes .	124.77003
when it was worn in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at least knew where it was ' ' .	156.89395
`` you have visited england five times in the past quarter-century , i believe ' ' , my host said .	238.67264
`` what has impressed you most on your present visit ' ' ? ?	122.713356
`` i would say depressed , not impressed ' ' , i told him .	13.169848
`` i should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas , involving clergymen and parishioners , psychiatrists and patients .	5906.5146
it is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas from the modern theatre ' ' .	647.1583
`` do you think we need a new henry james to re-explore the anglo-american scene ' ' ? ?	5483.103
`` or perhaps a new noel coward ' ' ? ?	8.3812
`` but you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of james and the antic heyday of coward .	5067.817
in them , there is usually a group of anglo-americans with tragicomic problems , worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire ' ' .	1006.1736
`` if you are trying to get us out of the brothel , the dustbin , the kitchen sink , and the tawdry living-room , you are probably wasting your time ' ' , moreland told me .	1224.8168
`` too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock ' ' .	551.2711
`` furiouser and furiouser ' ' , i said .	25.228167
`` i am worried about the current meanings of the word funny .	203.61914
it now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor	750.88257
disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny	7812.527
and frightening , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn ' t been home for two days and nights ' ' .	96.78394
moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which i made each of us a new drink .	464.2684
he took his glass , clinked it against mine , and said , `` toujours gai , what the hell ' ' ! !	596.8563
borrowing a line from don marquis ' mehitabel .	8.570409
`` be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change .	101.80127
it now means , in my country , homosexual ' ' , i said .	135.11993
`` oh , i forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance .	316.93042
recently , by the way , i received a questionnaire in which i was asked whether or not i was non-institutionalized ' ' .	348.9912
my host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks	9487.769
`` is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species ' ' ? ?	358.72583
`` oh , that is demonstrable ' ' , i told him .	22.144836
`` do you remember the woman in the french alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously ? ?	4346.4404
she told the sheep , ' the world is coming to an end ' ! !	81.80344
and the sheep said -- all in unison , i have no doubt -- ba-a-a ! !	393.74698
the sound mockery of sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh ' ' .	1520.6271
`` that is only partly non-nonsense ' ' , he began .	52.063076
`` if you saw the drama called rhinoceros ' ' , i said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros .	331.84088
the rhinos would panic , screaming help ! !	1.0792217
-- if that can be screamed in their language ' ' .	22.380564
`` you think the russians are getting ahead of us in comedy ' ' ? ?	57.055744
`` non-god , no ' ' , i said .	17.278494
`` the political and intellectual left began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as satire and irony , such as humor and comedy .	591.07996
nevertheless , like any other human being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , khrushchev , the anti-personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has .	1022.5694
in his famous meeting with nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as ed wynn .	321.2255
but , like caesar , he has only one joke , so far as i can find out .	154.142
it consists in saying , ' that would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage .	708.9575
why in the name of his non-god doesn ' t he vary it a bit ' ' ? ?	99.28195
`` such as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being to save humanity ' ' ' .	542.234
`` you and i have fallen out of literature into politics ' ' , moreland observed .	1033.3107
`` what a nasty fall was there ' ' ! !	8.717506
moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again , and then came back and sat down , restively .	366.43948
`` the world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free ' ' , he said , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy-free .	950.3289
in our age of science and angst it seems to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space ' ' .	366.9226
`` the human ego being what it is ' ' , i put in , `` science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats .	915.3041
it seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species ' ' .	188.32141
`` now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again ' ' , moreland protested .	1966.1333
`` not in the largest sense of the words ' ' , i said .	41.377907
`` the other day arnold toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else .	607.3376
why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ? ?	526.1769
forty years ago an english writer , w . l . george , dealt with this subject in eddies of the day , and said , as an example , that ' saint george for merry england ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' strike frog-eating frenchmen dead ' ' ' ! !	863.9411
`` there was also gott strafe angleterre ' ' , moreland reminded me , `` and carthago delenda est , or if you will , deus strafe carthage .	38188.406
it isn ' t what the ideologist believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy .	581.5101
this is the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state .	549.47266
complete power not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad .	3311.116
there is a bitter satire for a future writer in that ' ' .	146.84415
`` great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable ' ' , i said .	115.49366
`` but we now find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non-poetry .	2404.6853
i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about .	169.70908
one day , the children had wanted to get up onto general burnside ' s horse .	728.2087
they wanted to see what his back felt like -- the general ' s .	163.2003
arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by .	249.6905
arlene had a hard voice , too , this time .	199.58826
the policeman ' s eyes rather popped for a second	46.188828
but then arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` if it wasn ' t for these dear children ' ' -- .	89.89184
the policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` now , look here , lady i know you got to entertain these kids and all .	241.65271
but this is a public park and it ' s a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on ' ' .	221.83232
arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` yes , sir ' ' .	102.38271
the policeman walked on , but he looked back once .	349.75238
that had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred .	210.67467
arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area	654.70685
in matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments	6570.093
and so they were consistently true to their principles .	59.78424
`` never mind ' ' , arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups .	2250.0173
i know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn ' ' .	79.44742
asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable .	2715.2375
maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene .	4838.8584
`` just you wait ' ' , advised arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent british movie .	3681.248
and when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time .	1349.0323
first , arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults .	13151.148
they had protested that that wasn ' t any surprise .	455.97977
`` just you wait ' ' , said arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement .	2477.5225
`` is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal ' ' ? ?	3.3544872
`` not the least bit ' ' , arlene snapped .	13654.453
one of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions .	1008.44556
she would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously .	335.51038
just long enough to make you feel important .	10.89412
`` now ' ' , said arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable .	1670.0685
`` now , we ' re going to be like what general burnside and his horse make us think of ' ' .	1074.7124
the children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever .	847.25165
then , arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful .	122.40957
she held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked .	3563.1423
`` imagine being able to laugh and wink when you ' re like the top part of that picture frame at home ' ' , one of them said .	143.07396
`` i ' m general burnside ' s horse , upside down ' ' , arlene said , sort of gaspingly , for her even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position .	773.57117
she made general burnside ' s horse ' s belly do so funny when it was upside down .	610.5991
then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) .	899.14984
they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble .	372.70398
but they kept on clapping for a long , long time .	174.32312
`` this time ' ' , arlene said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you ' re going to tell me what i am and what i ' m doing .	126.28292
it all has something to do with general burnside and his horse ' ' .	321.76144
it was general burnside ' s horse running in a circle .	46.993935
his legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders .	396.8592
`` that ' s the general ' s horse ' ' , one of them cried out .	63.735626
the other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` that ' s a funny old horse ' ' .	36.610092
the first one said , `` he sure does shake .	3942.7717
then there was the general kissing his wife .	9.059257
but it was even funnier after they had been told .	51.431675
their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox .	1485.0924
he never could keep still , even when he didn ' t move his feet .	34.273815
then , they had to get up and be general burnside .	26730.299
all they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out .	499.2884
then , they said general burnside was going to jump over his horse ' s head	185.26514
but that wasn ' t very funny , either .	267.50687
`` you ought to shake ' ' , arlene advised them .	2750.3494
she also taught them to sing `` i wish i could shimmy like my sister kate ' ' .	1760.1134
they were clumsy , but they were beginning to catch on .	240.7199
they also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling .	1222.5867
`` imagine you won ' t get your allowance if you ' re caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much ' ' , arlene suggested .	616.76086
they were a little late in getting home .	6.1349463
`` i ' m sorry , mrs . minks ' ' , arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it .	1014.98236
my mother constituted herself the voice of all of us .	7.502345
`` it ' s perfectly understandable , arlene ' ' , my mother said in a friendly way .	64.182816
`` i suppose you all were playing and forgot ' ' ? ?	29.568396
`` yes , ma ' am ' ' , the children chorused heartily .	15699.927
the children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters	9600.742
and arlene began tapping the kitchen door open .	5.1036158
`` arlene ' s a good girl ' ' , my uncle remarked to us	174.34607
but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded .	347.3496
`` she really is a dear little thing ' ' , my mother agreed .	98.48312
and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing .	219.01382
also , she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish .	2218.5156
she would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting .	545.1821
also , when she had bitten off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable	13737.8
and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it .	1007.89075
one could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief .	857.0593
actually , it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it .	298.48578
but the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public .	91.311356
later on , the children told her further about somersaulting .	20315.588
`` it must be awfully good for them .	15.298096
and awfully kind of arlene ' ' , she told us later .	55.653954
`` but do you know something curious ' ' ? ?	2.32406
`` i reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress .	288.3074
but i would not pamper myself in that silly way .	1983.3623
i opened the window and threw the radish out ' ' .	28.56803
for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain .	2755.7224
a friend of my father ' s came to dinner .	358.25983
he was passing through town and phoned to say hello .	226.61154
as a result , he was persuaded out to dinner .	447.36914
as a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months .	224.95518
sometimes , he coincided with my father ' s being at home .	55.91045
sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not .	42.146698
he liked children , in a loathsome kind of way	161.95491
the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment .	336.7029
when he had left , i could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look .	822.511
this evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .	723.0408
there had been some coconut in it , for i remember my mother ' s taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a shiver .	820.6908
they were pushed gently into the room by arlene -- whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door .	1233.4658
`` tell mr . gorboduc what you ' re doing these days ' ' , my mother advised the children , ceremonially .	337.74588
there was an air of revolt about the children -- even irreverence for their own principles .	466.10773
this could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing , a horselike balkiness of demeanor .	16865.55
possibly , the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration .	538.1688
but , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air .	71.60186
`` we go to the park with this nice lady ' ' , one of them said .	88.47748
`` you don ' t step on the flowers , do you ? ?	214.68188
one of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger .	752.1615
mr . gorboduc took a swig of his sherry .	855.106
he was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs .	2480.1926
usually , this was done when attention was diverted by someone else ' s long , boring story .	1140.1697
but this time she was nervous she was open .	182.85046
mr . gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again .	84.46083
`` tell me -- what do you do at the park ' ' ? ?	24.676422
this was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over-pretended interest -- an admirable way with children .	7262.352
only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command .	1019.4346
this nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment .	884.6457
and the other went on to development of the idea .	69.94057
`` we grind , too ' ' , he said .	6.6459227
`` say that again ' ' , she pleaded .	6047.604
she laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass .	4953.481
he was very funny about the whole thing .	18.89022
pueri aquam de silvas ad agricolas portant , a delightful vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre-punic war rome .	6563.229
marcellus , the hero , is beset from all sides by the problems of approaching manhood .	315.88818
the story opens on the eve of his fifty-third birthday , as he prepares for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow .	580.35516
suddenly , a messenger arrives and , just before collapsing dead at his feet , informs him that the saracens have invaded silesia , the home province of his affianced .	4772.8335
he at once cancels the celebrations and , buckling on his scimitar , stumbles blindly from the house , where he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart .	1433.109
an unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of prometheus from the rock by the u . s . cavalry was given last week in the warehouse of the albany leather conduit company amid cheers of `` hubba hubba ' ' and `` yalagaloo pip pip ' ' ! !	2563.786
after a `` busy ' ' overture , the curtain rises on a farm scene -- the ranavan valley in northern maine .	1753.5415
a dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolizes the crisis and destruction of the old order .	207.93152
old order , acted and atonally sung by grunnfeu arapacis , the lovely serbantian import , then entered and delivered the well-known invocation to the god phineoppus , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering gorshek priests , symbolizing love , lust , prudence and general motors , respectively .	7051.363
according to the myth , old order then vanishes at stage left and reappears at extreme stage right , but director shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having miss arapacis walk across the stage .	26450.95
the night he saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining -- in ad-lib -- that `` it smelled ' ' .	1183.7303
we caught the early train to new york .	4.824027
the dharma dictionary , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with eurasian proto-senility cults .	19690.58
it ' s somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm .	891.67804
for example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik ' ' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha ' ' to salivate .	1731.9712
likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku ' ' , `` sweathruna ' ' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-birifw- ' ' all originated in the same village in bathar-on-walli province and are all used to express sentiments concerning british `` imperialism ' ' .	855.6693
the terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find out if he was a member of major pockmanster ' s delhi regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit .	416.49112
the breeze and chancellor neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a west german politician to woo a plaster cast of the apollo belvedere .	996.22156
as you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with freudian , jungian , and meinckian theory .	6805.213
for example , when the film is only four minutes old , neitzbohr refers to a small , victorian piano stool as `` wilhelmina ' ' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of course , was doris ( the english equivalent , when passed through middle-gaelic derivations , of wilhelmina ) .	2957.7656
for the remainder of the movie , chancellor neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war reichstag .	10775.388
in this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the english at dunkirk .	1122.9902
as we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing doris , therefore the english ) that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind .	3297.4966
and , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` he loves me , he loves me not ' ' .	327.28024
after a few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he ' ' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture .	523.8856
the effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the `` repressed ' ' movie-goer .	938.7571
the music of bini salfininistas , capital lp ab63711-r , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer .	2522.665
those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov festival in august , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice	663.8618
and it is not unlikely that , even as the great bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious salfininistas passed through his `` purgatory ' ' of neglect .	2179.7117
but now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer marc schlek , jr . , a major revival is under way .	842.0187
as he leads the neurenschatz skolkau orchestra , schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the baslot and rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor ' s insistence .	3333.0142
a major portion of the credit should also go to flautist haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` indianapolis ' ' movement in the baslot .	1783.1597
not only was haumd ' s intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride .	3645.7861
for example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest f-major register up to a barely audible n minor in four seconds , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist ' s credit that he remained silent throughout the passage .	961.43024
we would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance .	525.829
as broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the american theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance in that nebulous area known as `` off-broadway ' ' .	2838.7454
for the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non-dramas ' ' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer .	937.4326
the latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the , an adaptation of basho ' s classic frog-haiku by roger entwhistle , a former university of maryland chemistry instructor .	3058.1873
although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention .	1112.0038
the action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee .	850.2826
they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor .	2418.7878
the innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie , gets a plate of english muffins instead .	1487.7126
leaving the theatre after the performance , i had a flash of intuition that life , after all ( as rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired .	888.25464
aging but still precocious , french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel .	21444.893
a biting , pithy parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by mlle lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over and over by four thousand french horns ) by existentialist hot-shot jean-paul sartre .	5789.9634
ever since bambi , and , more recently , born free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with max fink ' s wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable my friend , the quizzical salamander .	1586.6111
done in the modern style of a `` confession ' ' , fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother ' s pet salamander , alicia .	977.0019
it is not an entirely happy book , as mrs . fink soon becomes jealous of alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass .	4236.8965
max , in a fit of despair , takes alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in burbank ( fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life ' ' ) , at the end of which alicia tragically contracts parkinson ' s disease and dies .	3257.6096
this brief resume hardly does the book justice , but i heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time .	137.96724
opera in the grand tradition , along with mah-jongg , seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback .	9715.887
in this country , the two guiding lights are , without doubt , felix fing and anna pulova .	7092.7666
fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for sir cedric hardwicke , is responsible for the rediscovery of verdi ' s earliest , most raucous opera , nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the mudugno version of `` volare ' ' .	1415.4285
miss pulova has a voice that maria callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw driver ' ' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of rosalie .	1801.008
the champs elysees is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of france ' s beat-up beatnik jeunes filles .	22226.547
cause of all this commotion squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly jean-pierre bravado , a bogartian figure , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic tasti-freeze salesman in old new-waver fredrico de mille rossilini ' s endlessly provocative film , a sour sponge .	25595.803
bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of france and myself ' ' ( de gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob ' ' ! !	278.91312
( norman mailer ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity whenever he is on it .	379.72885
soaring to stardom along with him , margo felicity brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling italian starlet , turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic .	22879.93
the battle of the drib-drool continues , but most of new york ' s knowing sophisticates of abstract expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of v ( for vindication ) day , september first , when augustus quasimodo ' s first one-man show opens at the guggenheim .	4122.6255
we have heard that after seeing mr . quasimodo ' s work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement .	363.92502
and it is thought by many who think about such things that quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with monet , progressed through kandinsky and the cubist picasso , and blossomed just recently in pollock and de kooning .	2571.5508
quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there ' ' .	101.55134
`` i paint the nothing ' ' , he said once to franz kline and myself , `` the nothing that is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non-time ' ' .	1569.4282
it is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` the invasion of cuba ' ' .	429.6853
in this work , his use of non-color is startling and skillful .	265.8389
the sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece .	467.9202
i asked quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas ' ' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity .	394.65656
dear sirs let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are .	998.86206
the collective by which i address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves .	7748.899
it is , i am reliably given to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost	1246.483
i . e . , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot-slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home .	1834.1012
since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that i am taunting you as socially inferior .	2238.4248
i merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman .	620.7481
above all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a few objets d ' art , or to shame you into rectitude .	2694.6858
my object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict .	634.1311
you have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them .	802.7984
quite candidly , fellows , i wouldn ' t be in your shoes for all the rice in china .	132.99147
as you ' ve doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly .	2079.4312
sometime on saturday evening , august 22nd , while my family and i were dining at the hostaria dell ' orso , in rome , you jimmied a window of our home in bucks county , pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises .	1475.7334
hastening to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there .	3360.0974
what you were looking for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak victrola .	12743.152
you danced two tangos and a paso doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu .	596.8873
you then descended one story , glommed a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom .	259.42902
from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of oriental and african origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade-handled magnifying glass .	3916.419
rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique french chess set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box kodaks , you added to your haul .	2981.197
then , having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover .	5085.8813
so much for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , i ' m sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake .	350.7682
the foregoing , aided by several clues i ' ll withhold to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector javert , but before they close in , gird yourselves , i repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless .	1699.8704
fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches .	1277.8796
in time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king ' s evil , sheep rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release .	3058.1316
all this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately forecast it .	3323.9897
if , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , i can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you ' ve affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance .	2331.2178
first of all , the six figures of the buddha you heisted -- four siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the earth-touching position , and a large brass figure of the dying buddha on a teakwood base .	5433.6094
now , you probably share the widespread western belief that the lord buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than jehovah and allah and the rest .	693.0998
' fess up -- don ' t you ? ?	6.759385
well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the wheel of the law specifies ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the presence .	2703.6785
eight or ten years ago , a couple of french hoods stole a priceless khmer head from the musee guimet , in paris , and a week later crawled into the salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy .	9692.935
hell ' s own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment	8757.863
they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the blessed one to forgive their desecration .	9844.478
any reputable french interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and i ' ll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let ' s resume our catalogue .	305.90472
whether the pair of sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in khartoum assured me , i am not competent to say .	2178.3972
likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady ' ' ( provenance honan )	3215.4043
a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack .	2643.777
the three indian brass deities , though -- ganessa , siva , and krishna -- are an altogether different cup of tea .	5006.173
they hail from travancore , a state in the subcontinent where kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped .	4108.0415
but it is the wooden sculpture from bali , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that i particularly call to your attention .	421.67435
oddly enough , this is an amulet against housebreakers , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 .	2969.09
inscribed around its base is a charm in balinese , a dialect i take it you don ' t comprehend .	848.0079
neither do i , but the tjokorda agoeng was good enough to translate , and i ' ll do as much for you .	78.19989
whosoever violates our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow .	6673.4546
the teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley car will grow in his stomach .	1628.9111
furthermore -- and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot .	8681.311
the cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation .	2928.0764
sort of remorseless , isn ' t it ? ?	12.523417
you ' re tooling around full of gage in your hot rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like ubermenschen .	10858.803
in that case , listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss .	31024.635
a couple of years back , i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn ' ' .	1334.8157
in it was a stone tibetan buddha i had picked up in bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and i garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap .	1201.0242
after a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it .	1070.788
our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer ' s boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead .	967.3943
the more i probed into this young man ' s activities and character , the less savory i found him .	475.34283
i learned , for example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet .	1396.1653
sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the bronx zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws .	5671.66
evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like enrico & paglieri ' s or peter ' s backyard drunkenly donning ladies ' hats and singing `` o sole mio ' ' .	20391.15
in short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash timber .	18886.018
well , the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn ' t retaliate , and in due course , as was inevitable , overreached himself .	2646.8677
one morning , we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap .	590.25
`` now he ' s bought it ' ' , said my wife contentedly .	991.3276
`` no divinity will hold still for that .	209.78389
he ' s really asking for it ' ' .	1.861987
the next time we saw him , he was a changed person	1763.0886
he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire .	1477.7021
some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice -- either an ape specter or abe spector , a process-server , we couldn ' t determine which .	2417.9968
his eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as dr . grimesby roylott ' s when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band .	3166.928
the grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go .	534.09863
the beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the buddha polished him off .	2196.0447
reduced to beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer .	741.2902
his hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the top .	2042.9768
he evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss .	23490.09
not long ago , i rode down with him in an elevator in radio city	1505.5063
he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once , clearly a man in extremis .	3196.4546
`` i wouldn ' t be in his shoes for all the rice in china .	401.19028
there ' s some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps ' ' .	998.6486
however one looks at it , therefore , i ' d say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy .	1205.7565
the inventory you acquired from me isn ' t going to be easy to move	56.153046
you can ' t very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot bodhisattva .	276.44955
additionally , since you ' re going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , delhi boil , the granville wilt , liver fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complications of the hex you ' ve aroused , you mustn ' t expect to be lionized socially .	8233.83
my advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , is that the next time you ' re attracted by the exotic , pass it up -- it ' s nothing but a headache .	373.8966
