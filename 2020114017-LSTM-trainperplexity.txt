the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta ' s recent primary election produced `` no evidence ' ' that any irregularities took place .	75.244156
the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta ' ' for the manner in which the election was conducted .	55.813786
the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities ' ' in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr . .	30.908485
`` only a relative handful of such reports was received ' ' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city ' ' .	35.943478
the jury said it did find that many of georgia ' s registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ' ' .	45.65082
it recommended that fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ' ' .	69.62552
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ' ' .	115.64972
however , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ' ' .	60.64144
the city purchasing department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ' ' .	56.827507
it urged that the city `` take steps to remedy ' ' this problem .	33.072838
implementation of georgia ' s automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .	48.90071
it urged that the next legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ' ' .	45.216835
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department ' s handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .	64.76985
`` this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program ' ' , the jury said , but the state welfare department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county , which receives none of this money .	40.57115
the jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ' ' .	129.75763
nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds ' ' , the jurors said .	59.8533
`` failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden ' ' on fulton taxpayers .	118.16532
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary ' s court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .	44.55523
the jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations ' ' of two previous grand juries , the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee .	103.97136
`` these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court ' s wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms ' ' , the jury said .	65.77361
regarding atlanta ' s new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge jan . 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences ' ' .	85.720314
the jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ' ' .	65.588234
on other matters , the jury recommended that ( 1 )	11.285671
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail ' ' .	54.4401
fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable ' ' pension plan for city employes .	50.396255
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department , the fulton tax commissioner ' s office , the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms , grady hospital and the fulton health department .	52.61934
mayor william b . hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , pearl williams hartsfield , in fulton superior court friday .	100.14903
the couple was married aug . 2 , 1913 .	23.107246
they have a son , william berry jr . , and a daughter , mrs . j . m . cheshire of griffin .	14.788055
attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon .	110.43686
the petition listed the mayor ' s occupation as `` attorney ' ' and his age as 71 .	61.095295
it listed his wife ' s age as 74 and place of birth as opelika , ala . .	87.50595
the petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year .	64.35182
the hartsfield home is at 637 e . pelham rd . aj .	14.803213
henry l . bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor ' s attorney .	18.223255
hartsfield has been mayor of atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 .	176.49939
his political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 .	95.628784
the mayor ' s present term of office expires jan . 1 .	8.843911
he will be succeeded by ivan allen jr . , who became a candidate in the sept . 13 primary after mayor hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection .	29.446182
georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor ' s race , a top official said wednesday .	74.241936
robert snodgrass , state gop chairman , said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .	88.05264
state party chairman james w . dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept . 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen . john tower will be the featured speaker .	59.196537
in the blue ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .	112.449005
despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to republicans who attended .	86.4005
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents .	103.46586
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken 1	195.28477
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2	101.81471
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform .	93.15547
sam caldwell , state highway department public relations director , resigned tuesday to work for lt . gov . garland byrd ' s campaign .	32.892525
caldwell ' s resignation had been expected for some time .	23.561783
he will be succeeded by rob ledford of gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .	30.845404
when the gubernatorial campaign starts , caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for byrd .	65.88348
the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly .	224.52524
before adjournment monday afternoon , the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made .	31.922352
gov . vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment .	132.1736
vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item .	128.80539
meanwhile , it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds .	128.91838
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia ' s most heavily traveled highways .	92.89238
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work .	95.024734
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities .	145.34334
vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov . marvin griffin .	51.072384
the highway department source told the constitution , however , that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .	131.5441
schley county rep . b . d . pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the body ' s action of friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances .	124.87925
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie ' ' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .	109.5976
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 87-31 .	140.02568
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 29-5 .	21.84242
as of sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action .	150.86374
pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions .	135.8554
a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past .	162.02026
rep . mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended ' ' as state funds .	106.63223
barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed ' ' .	80.48306
but he added that none of georgia ' s congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .	61.919838
the resolution , which barber tossed into the house hopper friday , will be formally read monday .	310.64365
it says that `` in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds ' ' , the state board of education should be directed to `` give priority ' ' to teacher pay raises .	59.256237
-- after a long , hot controversy , miller county has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election i ever saw in this county ' ' .	56.00437
the new school superintendent is harry davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated felix bush , a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee .	51.067394
davis received 1 , 119 votes in saturday ' s election , and bush got 402 .	90.11621
ordinary carey williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order .	179.57909
`` this was the coolest , calmest election i ever saw ' ' , colquitt policeman tom williams said .	32.01296
`` being at the polls was just like being at church .	165.99188
i didn ' t smell a drop of liquor , and we didn ' t have a bit of trouble ' ' .	13.500322
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however .	147.32079
it was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence .	52.561176
the former county school superintendent , george p . callan , shot himself to death march 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board .	55.704556
during the election campaign , both candidates , davis and bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls .	91.87979
ordinary williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .	221.38046
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .	143.0913
sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise .	224.38716
`` everything went real smooth ' ' , the sheriff said .	22.77908
`` there wasn ' t a bit of trouble ' ' .	11.382192
-- committee approval of gov . price daniel ' s `` abandoned property ' ' act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers .	173.68481
daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures , in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation .	79.49797
under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .	61.830593
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it .	125.43146
daniel termed `` extremely conservative ' ' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug . 31 .	40.617752
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since texas was a republic ' ' .	90.21854
it permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .	121.68659
the bill , which daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .	94.342186
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , daniel declared .	65.1574
dewey lawrence , a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .	90.6904
`` if you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy ' ' , he said .	13.75188
`` you take out of circulation many millions of dollars ' ' .	5.0988173
rep . charles e . hughes of sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies ' ' .	55.847195
his contention was denied by several bankers , including scott hudson of sherman , gaynor b . jones of houston , j . b . brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin .	32.14814
cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional ' ' since , he said , it would impair contracts .	41.974594
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last monday .	67.25593
-- senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen . george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties .	58.9262
the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .	50.357567
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house .	34.55004
it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300 , 000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here .	74.7117
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas , harris , bexar , tarrant and el paso would be $451 , 500 , which would be a savings of $157 , 460 yearly after the first year ' s capital outlay of $88 , 000 was absorbed , parkhouse told the senate .	46.826004
the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county , saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school .	60.83265
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps . v . e . ( red ) berry and joe ratcliff .	57.438152
while details are still to be worked out , ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berry ' s proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .	123.71149
`` we ' re getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting ' ' , said ratcliff .	71.41415
`` but i believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also .	77.17205
i ' m willing to stake my political career on it ' ' .	17.425589
rep . berry , an ex-gambler from san antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies .	76.2015
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later .	82.486595
the house passed finally , and sent to the senate , a bill extending the state health department ' s authority to give planning assistance to cities .	50.787777
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar .	137.24913
another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district .	3.8855357
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted .	116.55411
without dissent , senators passed a bill by sen . a . r . schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district .	35.72253
money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site .	137.73003
one , by sen . louis crump of san saba , would aid more than 17 , 000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized .	63.348675
instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1 , 000 fine .	46.25571
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league .	88.485535
the other bill , by sen . a . m . aikin jr . of paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds .	49.751087
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by sen . frank owen 3 , of el paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas .	83.928635
marshall formby of plainview , former chairman of the texas highway commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections .	82.77126
under formby ' s plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the house , attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court .	28.824862
-- state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay .	133.49773
an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot , when texas votes on a u . s . senator .	58.054947
rep . wesley roberts of seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill .	108.43471
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb . 22 .	82.799644
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot , roberts said .	48.040108
opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn ' t give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .	61.68847
all dallas members voted with roberts , except rep . bill jones , who was absent .	48.03826
-- paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas ' big cities thursday .	236.15863
rep . james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise , a wise county hamlet of 250 people .	156.10234
when the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen . george parkhouse of dallas .	40.83628
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen . parkhouse .	45.399204
the bill would increase from $5 , 000 , 000 to $15 , 000 , 000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .	42.16119
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas .	308.60815
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway cotten ' s attack .	92.37246
the bill ' s defenders were mostly small-town legislators like j . w . buchanan of dumas , eligio ( kika ) de la garza of mission , sam f . collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs .	38.760086
`` this is a poor boy ' s bill ' ' , said chapman .	34.888985
`` dallas and fort worth can vote bonds .	9.381771
this would help the little peanut districts ' ' .	2.0062451
-- a houston teacher , now serving in the legislature , proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods ' ' .	191.35364
rep . henry c . grover , who teaches history in the houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods ' ' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate .	85.647835
a normal year ' s work in college is 30 semester hours .	141.96529
grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching .	116.05288
the remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects .	67.63591
`` a person with a master ' s degree in physics , chemistry , math or english , yet who has not taken education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools ' ' , said grover .	44.564163
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses .	31.82115
fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as co-signers of the proposal .	27.242449

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon ' ' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program .	77.24307
the report , culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load .	136.69455
the report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and adc dependency ' ' .	27.252903
the monthly cost of adc to more than 100 , 000 recipients in the county is 4 . 4 million dollars , said c . virgil martin , president of carson pirie scott & co . , committee chairman .	35.230335
`` we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence ' ' , martin said .	90.25012
the volume of adc cases will decrease , martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .	141.50854
these , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc ' ' .	90.624695
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .	68.81994

several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , judge james b . parsons was told in criminal court yesterday .	85.03137
the disclosure by charles bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .	84.82561
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client , alan clements , 30 , a separate trial .	76.57993
bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom .	36.800964
`` the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client ' ' , bellows told the court .	38.894836
`` some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .	279.65518
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others ' ' .	52.454662
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ' ' ? ?	39.993347
`` yes , your honor ' ' , replied bellows .	72.868065
`` what this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case .	24.838709
there is a conflict among the defendants ' ' .	1.6138103
-- president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio .	150.1735
the president spent much of the week-end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone .	115.754166
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port , mass . , a white house spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go ' ' toward completion .	78.58723
asked to elaborate , pierre salinger , white house press secretary , replied , `` i would say it ' s got to go thru several more drafts ' ' .	36.09916
salinger said the work president kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia ' s demands and proposals for the city .	83.829765
the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov . 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m . karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means ' ' .	57.77762
karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence ' ' of the 50 persons .	124.516655
he said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens ' ' .	17.434452
karns ' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases .	194.12822
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case ' ' .	24.74606
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j . wexler , special prosecutor .	45.062824
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .	70.58094
mayer goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .	43.256668
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning .	67.694016
karns said it was a `` wrongful act ' ' for wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room ' ' .	67.683495
he said this constituted a `` very serious misuse ' ' of the criminal court processes .	20.766184
`` actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court ' ' , said karns , who is a city judge in east st . louis sitting in cook county court .	66.654335
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .	120.99194
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary ' ' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .	64.32213
the cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .	16.057795
the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns .	35.89728
after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them .	149.64252
-- president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14 . 2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .	112.73006
the president , in a special message to congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .	127.74129
the aged care plan , similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on capitol hill .	80.29558
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .	67.56512
the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4 , 800 of pay per year .	60.5476
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5 , 000 a year and the payroll tax to 6 . 5 per cent -- 3 . 25 per cent each .	20.448257
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .	83.783936
the payroll tax would actually rise to 7 . 5 per cent starting jan . 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .	39.98429
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1 . 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .	92.971794
both figures would go higher in later years .	5.5259204
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .	57.893204
these would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .	151.05434
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1	168.99023
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .	43.721207
full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .	87.53279
a patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula ' ' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit .	118.76546
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient .	87.57304
community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .	62.859222
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .	66.65901
he said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay ' ' .	88.571144
`` this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs ' ' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals .	55.365124
`` this is not a program of socialized medicine .	15.712057
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .	157.15385
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital ' ' .	43.0665
they would still be paid by the patient .	8.117493
apart from the aged care plan the president ' s most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .	41.286243
the president said the nation ' s 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .	97.75764
moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can ' t afford the schooling costs .	45.176785
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1 , 500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .	69.31689
the schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2 , 000 a year per student .	79.36987
in addition , the government would pay a $1 , 000 `` cost of education ' ' grant to the schools for each $1 , 500 in scholarship grants .	46.632336
officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5 . 1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .	52.587723
the president recommended federal `` matching grants ' ' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones .	37.20122
in the area of `` community health services ' ' , the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .	44.016888
he asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial ' ' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants ' ' to states to improve nursing homes .	36.79988
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .	190.5759
in the child health field , the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children ' s bureau .	64.624146
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .	122.59299
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .	54.057224
for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .	96.85149
the president said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine .	59.761868
the president said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them ' ' .	95.666374
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .	417.5404
legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the president ' s plan .	31.414928
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .	188.95807
senate republican leader dirksen ( ill . ) and house republican leader charles halleck ( ind . ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .	95.66756
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .	56.613647
house speaker sam rayburn ( d . , tex . ) called the kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing ' ' , but made no prediction on its fate in the house .	61.52188
-- acting hastily under white house pressure , the senate tonight confirmed robert c . weaver as the nation ' s federal housing chief .	91.30691
only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .	71.423004
a number of scattered `` ayes ' ' and `` noes ' ' was heard .	14.552125
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .	71.24426
in the last eight years , all presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .	73.35873
the rule was enforced by demand of sen . wayne morse ( d . , ore . ) in connection with president eisenhower ' s cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedy ' s in 1961 .	37.331314
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .	98.130196
this has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .	161.27089
in oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another ' s problems .	72.553215
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist ' ' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .	70.459915
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence .	103.5235
in the case of portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .	100.18801
the general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .	73.04908
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members ' votes , since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance .	70.48643
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive .	82.21957
even norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the nato line .	77.84377
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .	103.47208
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk ' s speeches as `` inconclusive ' ' .	13.982936
but he hastened to add that , if united states policies were not always clear , despite mr . rusk ' s analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .	83.44308
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited .	50.51777
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite mr . rusk ' s personal popularity , that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .	95.19635
the secretary of state himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .	72.156075
but where the core of nato is concerned , the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states ' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone ' ' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato ' s disposal in european waters .	42.73342
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .	60.21726
the secretary ' s greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east-west friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .	132.49142
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .	52.88883
this increase in the `` threshold ' ' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance ' s most difficult problems in the months to come .	62.97449
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .	343.61584
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time .	56.84667
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos .	93.682
the united states , state department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam .	56.52547
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this .	63.248344
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated .	89.2025
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .	25.918535
the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference .	38.190918
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .	28.911266
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .	134.34135
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .	74.43406
but with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises	72.2284
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression ? ?	103.259
former vice-president richard m . nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union .	39.303837
he was critical of what he feels is president kennedy ' s tendency to be too conciliatory .	36.459442
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it .	157.92075
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders ' ' in cuba .	48.36616
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn ' t attack the kennedy administration on this score .	54.136326
his reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .	44.875763
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .	500.4344
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b . morton ( r ) of kentucky , chairman of the republican national committee , that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination .	36.626793
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard , boston university , brandeis , and massachusetts institute of technology educators .	72.61275
this group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups ' ' .	58.018967
it recommends that the united states `` seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations	73.94061
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds ' ' .	52.176178
mr . nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation .	252.83057
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated .	141.47717
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos , almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by mr . nixon and the professors .	77.87017
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration .	74.063484
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements .	418.03708
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .	46.86785
but thus far there has been no response in kind .	196.34792
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .	54.958477
in laos , the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture .	80.24544
again and again it asked the communists to `` freeze ' ' the military situation in laos .	31.541937
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate .	141.43097
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service ' ' and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization .	118.957146
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos .	44.996742
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos .	60.868046
there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , thailand and south viet nam .	118.51343
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos .	29.180727
the pro-western government , which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma `` neutralist ' ' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army .	73.36227
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the pro-western government to the hilt .	60.051697
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .	72.536026
one factor was the statement of senator j . w . fulbright ( d ) of arkansas , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee .	15.655466
he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal ' ' of prince souvanna .	47.597584
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states .	16.242632
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation ' ' .	25.026466
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the president ' s committee on juvenile delinquency and crime , to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .	54.024048
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend .	77.81308
the president has also called upon the attorney general , the secretary of health , education and welfare , and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .	30.839191
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l . hackett , a special assistant to the attorney general , as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime .	28.644648
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders .	49.16699
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age .	49.086933
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , raymond h . hawksley , the present city cd head , believes .	128.67346
mr . hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally ' ' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .	80.36342
east providence now has no civil defense program .	2.0312562
mr . hawksley , the state ' s general treasurer , has been a part-time cd director in the city for the last nine years .	37.51381
he is not interested in being named a full-time director .	106.510124
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nation ' s civil defense program , mr . hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .	37.581493
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about $3 , 500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .	70.548836
mr . hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time cd job .	35.089798
one of these men is former fire chief john a . laughlin , he said .	29.08466
along with a director , the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .	98.69081
one advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .	55.96294
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said .	45.53274
mr . hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station .	162.62025
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area .	40.17463
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , mr . hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .	43.30932
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in seekonk would be another .	80.05858
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point .	58.909958
mr . hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .	126.44133
such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .	70.7022
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time cd director , mr . hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .	45.960064
one of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .	65.05623
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government .	27.773937
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .	241.09668
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly .	56.168686
the governor ' s move into the so-called `` blue law ' ' controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r . grant , deputy city clerk of central falls .	62.427654
mr . notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july 10 and sent to the state house by miss grant .	72.08644
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .	69.188194
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review , mr . notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty . gen . j . joseph nugent to get `` the benefit of his views ' ' .	49.384094
he will then appoint the study committee with mr . nugent ' s cooperation , the governor said .	23.47144
`` i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings ' ' , mr . notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws ' ' .	46.616707
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales ' ' .	68.33975
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .	51.323513
should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .	72.620575
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws .	147.05675
the statutes , similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath .	81.96607
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday .	163.29823
the only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday ' ' , the council ' s resolution said .	45.659355
the small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community ' ' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors ' ' .	36.002064
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue ' ' to the local government .	20.402334
the council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business ' ' on sunday .	42.851658
they `` operate on a volume basis ' ' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community ' ' .	46.864635
liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , george h . reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .	206.29546
mr . reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheraton-biltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare ' ' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .	43.02597
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .	115.02984
he said he was `` confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 1910 ' ' .	11.011858
that , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade .	40.9679
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party .	41.496815
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track .	32.399128
he steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track ' ' .	43.14838
he said that when he was a socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources .	67.783844
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .	95.265686
mr . reama , who retired as vice president of the american screw co . in 1955 said , `` both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it ' ' .	64.55218
he said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze ' ' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .	115.64956
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , mr . reama said `` a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own ' ' .	68.20137
mr . reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .	104.57133
a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1 , 700 johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .	55.510303
william a . martinelli , chairman of the citizens group of johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr . .	75.27635
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and mr . martinelli happens to hold that post .	46.181427
mr . martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .	89.673416
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work .	55.04605
a difference of opinion arose between mr . martinelli and john p . bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .	59.94078
mr . martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while mr . bourcier said that a special election might be called instead .	47.98558
mr . bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .	141.14525
he assured mr . martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .	75.43345
mr . martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .	150.90776
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .	116.746284
`` after inspiring this , i think we should certainly follow through on it ' ' , he declared .	40.900326
`` it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement ' ' .	38.999115
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission .	69.377396
`` our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement ' ' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town ' ' .	45.02024
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september .	62.84442
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town ' s insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .	73.93339
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .	62.85881
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses ' ' .	53.984993
several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system .	66.76201
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at monday ' s special north providence town council meeting .	63.62828
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a . abatuno to draft the ordinance .	114.95302
at the last session of the general assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .	72.62951
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .	54.548355
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition .	256.27713
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .	220.38051
-- james p . mitchell and sen . walter h . jones r-bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j . hughes , democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the gop is `` campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism ' ' .	44.53144
mitchell was for using it , jones against , and sen . wayne dumont jr . r-warren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park hotel .	57.24651
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club .	93.974014
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of women ' s clubs .	60.78947
hughes said monday , `` it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired .	80.80331
now he ' s gone , the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state ' ' .	18.984097
sunday he had added , `` we can love eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership ' ' .	78.8225
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .	88.21503
`` how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ' ' ? ?	83.70698
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy ' ' while working in his adminstration .	134.061
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall ' s presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue .	57.69596
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .	179.53499
`` he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign ' ' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign ' ' .	41.747643
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes ' remark .	134.12923
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary .	179.53839
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .	19.321234
state aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority , and making new jersey attractive to new industry .	83.86163
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republican-controlled state senate `` must share the blame for this ' ' .	57.215996
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co . plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .	107.32814
`` but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time ' ' , mitchell said .	27.69018
jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for mitchell .	237.72525
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises .	110.22599
`` he calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can ' t have it both ways ' ' , jones said .	44.72874
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue ' ' .	71.963
`` i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j . hughes .	112.260796
his reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president ' s leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations .	42.31341
`` i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .	167.99333
`` such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .	74.03845
it can only rebound to mr . hughes ' discredit ' ' .	7.8432755
sen . charles w . sandman , r-cape may , said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .	114.71773
sandman , state campaign chairman for jones , was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel , newark , of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones .	119.53148
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican party ' s nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .	77.96082
sandman said `` the announcement that sen . clifford case aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr . mitchell is a dead giveaway .	136.34883
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jersey ' s problems .	106.15501
`` we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr . mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington .	63.88161
`` we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr . mitchell some of the glow of sen . case ' s candidacy of last year .	88.72598
that , too , will fail ' ' .	2.2262406
sandman announced the appointment of mrs . harriet copeland greenfield of 330 woodland ave . , westfield , as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee .	41.07085
mrs . greenfield is president of the westfield women ' s republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman .	46.57159
county supervisor weldon r . sheets , who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them .	89.815834
the proposal , sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a `` lip service word ' ' .	81.94844
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .	87.84304
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january , 1964 .	38.76887
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines .	133.22542
the candidacy of mayor james j . sheeran of west orange , for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county , was supported today by edward w . roos , west orange public safety commissioner .	85.333984
sheeran , a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organization ' s candidate , freeholder william macdonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy , now a member of the state board of tax appeals .	57.46453
`` my experience as public safety commissioner ' ' , roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .	65.93784
-- william j . seidel , state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development , has retired after 36 years of service .	28.854124
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a . bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state .	32.919872
seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies .	96.51374
in october 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section .	70.29454
under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting .	100.7773
he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station .	126.90164
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens .	41.920338
he is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the red cross and state department of education .	56.352932
-- richard j . hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state ' ' .	49.516777
he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn `` when i come back here after the november election you ' ll think , ' you ' re my man -- you ' re the kind of governor we ' re glad we elected ' ' ' .	60.34155
he said , `` we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time ' ' .	43.117775
in his only attack on the republicans , hughes said , `` the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .	93.369194
but we ' ll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .	488.38217
we ' ll not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson .	91.08548
`` we ' ll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november ' ' .	57.7755
he said , `` you can see signs of the republicans ' feeble attack on the meyner administration .	41.166534
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead ' ' .	24.32292
he urged new jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy ' ' .	27.956898
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .	57.84058
`` we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean ' ' , the former superior court judge said .	42.42763
`` to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early 1940s ' ' .	31.542381
calling the democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people ' ' , hughes asked , `` a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november ' ' .	37.232624
hughes supported gov . meyner ' s `` green acres ' ' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development .	104.0209
he said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday .	56.270153
the plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state .	46.865227
the other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis .	24.757196
hughes said , `` this is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it ' ' , pointing out the state population has increased 125 , 000 each year since 1950 .	53.702805
he said `` morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve ' ' .	58.357307
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved .	42.784073
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans .	52.343224
`` after the primary ' ' , he promised , `` i ' ll be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration .	89.53827
i ' m not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee ' ' .	14.808759
-- fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .	139.11612
the outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the april 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by .	112.90322
there may be other 1961 state committee retirements come april 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters .	84.72099
a special presentation was made to mrs . geraldine thompson of red bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .	73.089874
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women ' s suffrage amendment .	45.631428
she served one four-year term on the national committee .	6.8471212
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r . screvane and abraham d . beame as running mates .	73.45716
at the same time reaction among anti-organization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayor ' s reported plan was generally favorable .	40.428024
some anti-organization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .	58.913414
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayor ' s efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .	134.16492
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr . wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .	60.872486
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr . wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept . 7 democratic primary .	68.21362
these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr . wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city .	37.534126
their view is that last-minute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor .	98.85811
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , mr . wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a . buckley , the bronx democratic leader , and with joseph t . sharkey , the brooklyn democratic leader .	38.99167
as usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g . de sapio , the manhattan leader .	42.789135
he is publicly on record as believing mr . de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party .	36.556843
last night the mayor visited mr . buckley at the bronx leader ' s home for a discussion of the situation .	18.665316
apparently he believes mr . buckley holds the key to the democratic organization ' s acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .	65.79033
in talks with mr . buckley last week in washington , the mayor apparently received the bronx leader ' s assent to dropping controller lawrence e . gerosa , who lives in the bronx , from this year ' s ticket .	41.813965
but mr . buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr . gerosa ' s successor .	30.667624
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr . screvane , who lives in queens , to replace abe stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for president of the city council and mr . beame , who lives in brooklyn , to replace mr . gerosa as the candidate for controller .	49.0433
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx .	46.98422
after his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday ' s new york times .	40.5859
`` it didn ' t come from me .	9.359627
but as i have said before , if i announce my candidacy , i will have something definite to say about running mates ' ' .	43.50395
-- a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts .	106.81198
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics .	43.230354
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same ' ' .	84.93189
`` it ' s ' see joe , see jim ' ' ' , he says .	26.20743
a political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters ' ' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control .	160.18436
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them ' ' .	51.944496
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin o ' connor ' s novel , `` the last hurrah ' ' .	31.117641
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .	9.527166
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .	42.69413
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations .	101.271065
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state .	57.594864
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in massachusetts public life .	105.57463
day after day some new episode is reported .	7.683767
the state public works department is accused of having spent $8 , 555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property .	89.82941
an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate .	23.934776
-- congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .	31.271921
in the senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .	114.69246
in the house , the southern-republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administration ' s housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill .	50.36158
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee .	96.70225
it is expected to be reported out tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .	23.529253
the panel ' s action depends on the return of representative james w . trimble , democrat of arkansas , who has been siding with speaker sam rayburn ' s forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor .	53.37176
mr . trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday .	248.42903
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans .	47.172386
the democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .	90.08399
the $6 , 100 , 000 , 000 measure , which was passed last monday by the senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families .	53.285847
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .	152.76527
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee , where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy .	119.72401
they are james j . delaney of queens and thomas p . o ' neill jr . of massachusetts .	22.824478
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 1958 .	45.07949
this would provide for long-term federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .	91.199524
mr . delaney and mr . o ' neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee .	69.032745
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .	38.997997
in the $40 , 000 , 000 budget that has been submitted for congressional approval , $26 , 000 , 000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .	52.21748
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , gordon boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a washington interview .	53.910664
six of these were proposed by religious groups .	3.5980122
they will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in southeast asia , africa , the middle east and latin america .	16.874153
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .	86.20749
there are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example	58.812458
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .	76.39698
the u . s . government is paying for it .	17.730593
the u . s . government pays for all its overseas workers ' ' .	28.259586
`` i don ' t work for the government ' ' , the american said .	17.917353
`` same thing ' ' , he said .	1.9429835
and then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem	39.69471
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ?	92.64498
r . sargent shriver jr . , director of the corps , is certain that they can .	58.30546
no religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes .	115.90859
-- at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia , premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming `` look , he took everything i had ' ' ! !	67.85327

indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of asia , africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid .	57.540264
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations .	56.403393
the communist countries allocated more than $1 , 000 , 000 , 000 in economic aid alone last year , according to western estimates .	35.32046
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .	132.7209
in 1960 more than 6 , 000 communist technicians were present in those countries .	59.3536
united nations , n . y . , june 18	344.23773
-- a committee of experts has recommended that a country ' s population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations .	50.386463
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations .	34.90841
one effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india .	85.603615
india is the most populous united nations member with more than 400 , 000 , 000 inhabitants .	26.862902

the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week .	51.451126
the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines	71.5305
each of the organization ' s ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to start .	103.60291

they had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation ' ' , she said .	25.937998
the three laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .	89.01932
the princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .	133.50346
the meetings in zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government .	119.392494

-- thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan . 20 .	45.544422
assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f . kennedy and retiring president dwight d . eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route .	94.90093
pennsylvania avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint .	68.46239
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .	11.992347
within view of the avenue are some of the united states government ' s tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .	41.951595
of course , 1600 pennsylvania , the white house , is the most famous address of the free world .	22.812832
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high .	213.3189
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old .	52.16459
in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .	165.61635
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote .	104.74216
in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .	44.140274
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in 1865 is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country ' s most valuable records are kept .	60.760227
also the department of justice building is located where j . edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation .	30.664494
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground .	140.96466
many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square , opposite the white house .	25.935883
in this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen . andrew jackson , hero of the battle of new orleans .	61.542244
moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least 40 marching units .	62.222683
about 16 , 000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .	37.35562
division one of the parade will be the service academies .	21.878393
division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas , the respective states of the president and of vice-president l . b . johnson .	32.352566
then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .	24.13205
division three will be headed by the marines followed by 12 states	159.13019
division four will be headed by the navy , followed by 11 states	31.320347
division five , by the air force followed by 11 states .	41.12998
division six will be headed by the coast guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , puerto rico , the virgin islands , guam , american samoa , the trust territories and the canal zone .	30.325304
-- what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi ? ?	151.98245
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state ' s immediate political future .	115.329445
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- gov . ross barnett .	57.377903
barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .	163.23735
consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year .	145.30716
some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .	126.75004
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor ' s office .	77.39327
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble .	83.58501
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon ' ' he had in the 1960 legislative session .	85.0036
if barnett doesn ' t call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session .	44.1378
the odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .	35.420536
legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22 . 50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating .	120.80544
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .	42.102177
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state ' s congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .	86.40631
with eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic delta district , and congressman frank e . smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature .	85.0255
mississippi ' s relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house .	40.18276
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck .	42.355934
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .	155.82703
barnett , as the titular head of the democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary .	78.445816
with a democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election .	174.74074
now , the picture is clouded , and even us sens . james o . eastland and john c . stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .	55.726875
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .	101.76118
-- the gov . jimmie h . davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor ' s theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .	83.51195
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .	192.52623
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government .	110.13925
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .	42.30643
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .	74.38148
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .	109.1788
indeed , the administration ' s curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .	65.44422
the administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .	25.463232
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .	82.523224
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes .	78.46654
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy .	70.04266
if it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .	51.998276
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature .	4.686189
actually , davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .	148.16702
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration .	101.26068
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly .	322.70734
they would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual .	34.6414
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition .	236.56921
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .	94.18594
then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .	138.33627
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .	137.60168
but if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .	67.84797
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash .	114.07504
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .	69.24302
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma .	51.626534
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .	83.058815
in either case , it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .	76.1744
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .	135.86603
it is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .	17.614378
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature .	61.07508
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .	63.979378
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .	64.87662
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .	158.84583
the new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .	105.67506
city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track ' ' with the city .	64.46113
estimates of the city ' s loss in the $344 , 000 job have ranged as high as $200 , 000 .	54.8626
hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co . contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate ' ' bids of competing contractors .	40.773773
the hughes concern then took `` shortcuts ' ' on the project but got paid anyway , hemphill said .	68.61478
the controller ' s charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday	211.69911
the city has sued for the full amount of the $172 , 400 performance bond covering the contract .	129.68568
the philadelphia transportation co . is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project .	209.10965
the signature of harold v . varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project .	68.972404
varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor .	23.432842
managing director donald c . wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter .	52.13436
the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959 .	75.64297
the hughes company and the consolidated industries , inc . , both of 3646 n . 2d st . , filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law .	52.297222
on monday , the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization .	117.18545
business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c . crumlish , jr . .	41.936615
the suit was filed later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms .	187.16531
travelers indemnity co . and the continental casualty co . .	16.226181
at berger ' s direction , the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u . s . district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there .	74.89522
`` i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated ' ' , berger said .	41.9889
the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track .	186.73892
the contract called for overhauling of 102 joints .	13.101503
the city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , hemphill charged .	82.20043
hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint .	74.691154
the bid from a . belanger and sons of cambridge , mass . , which listed the same officers as hughes , was $600 per joint .	115.827705
but , hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint .	61.423653
berger ' s decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference .	79.59647
wagner said the city paid only $37 , 500 to the hughes company .	51.073826
`` we won ' t know the full amount until we get a full report ' ' , wagner said .	56.096363
`` we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond ' ' , berger said .	12.742503
wagner replied , `` can ' t you just see the headline ' city hooked for $172 , 000 ' ' ' ? ?	48.669147
berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount ' ' .	43.344852
douglas m . pratt , president of the ptc , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el .	79.146774
`` we want to find out who knew about it ' ' , pratt said .	14.750954
`` certain people must have known about it ' ' .	3.695985
`` the ptc is investigating the whole matter ' ' , pratt said .	8.054624
samuel d . goodis , representing the philadelphia hotel association , objected on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year .	85.39557
goodis voiced his objection before city council ' s finance committee .	19.736729
for hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , goodis said .	48.598557
his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services .	92.40505
the new fees are expected to raise an additional $740 , 000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2 , 330 , 000 more a year after that .	34.485874
the ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room .	65.72295
the cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 .	28.866997
goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels .	37.558636
the city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457 , 000 a year .	69.111664
the increase also was opposed by leonard kaplan , spokesman for the home builders association of philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses .	139.84619
a proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from councilwoman virginia knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs .	51.9376
the ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog .	140.92628
mrs . knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city ' s services to animal care .	73.56646
in reply , deputy police commissioner howard r . leary said that the city spends more than $115 , 000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43 , 000 in fees .	54.683582
he reported that the city ' s contributions for animal care included $67 , 000 to the women ' s s . p . c . a .	24.262568
$15 , 000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15 , 000 to investigate dog bites .	54.960968
city finance director richard j . mcconnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year .	50.760162
the city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said .	66.32185
the new fee schedule also was supported by commissioner of licenses and inspections barnet lieberman and health commissioner eugene a . gillis .	50.736824
petitions asking for a jail term for norristown attorney julian w . barnard will be presented to the montgomery county court friday , it was disclosed tuesday by horace a . davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last nov . 1 by barnard ' s hit-run car .	57.19985
the petitions will be presented in open court to president judge william f . dannehower , davenport said .	60.328835
barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by judge warren k . hess , and placed on two years ' probation providing he does not drive during that time .	88.71985
he was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning .	156.17911
victim of the accident was robert lee stansbery , 39 .	38.62613
his widow started the circulation of petitions after barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation .	26.073322
the city planning commission on tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the redevelopment authority for the purchase of land in the $300 , 000 , 000 eastwick redevelopment area project .	32.298058
the commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project .	45.93094
one of the agreements calls for the new eastwick corp . to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12 , 192 , 865 .	29.083246
the tract is bounded by island ave . , dicks ave . , 61st st . , and eastwick ave . .	14.735818
it is designated as stage 1 residential on the redevelopment authority ' s master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores .	76.93423
the corporation was formed by the reynolds metal co . and the samuel a . and henry a . berger firm , a philadelphia builder , for work in the project .	79.29939
the second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of stage 1 residential to philadelphia builders eastwick corp . , a firm composed of 10 philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project .	125.72163
the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by dr . constantinos a . doxiadis , former minister of reconstruction in greece and a consulting planner for the new eastwick corp . .	30.088186
the plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic .	65.26282
it provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project .	39.373363
the esplanade eliminates grovers ave . , which on original plans ran through the center of the development .	87.50182
the esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project .	19.110655
kansas city , mo . , feb . 9 ( upi )	7.849229
-- the president of the kansas city local of the international association of fire fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work .	58.442604
battalion chief stanton m . gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles .	59.792137
the battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work .	102.72566
`` i ' d just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and i was lying on the driveway ' ' , he said .	25.766628
gladden ' s wife and two of his sons , john , 17 , and jim , 13 , were inside the house .	38.321987
the younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall .	41.76821
the explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house .	21.255812
the left front wheel landed 100 feet away .	16.137035
police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either tnt or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel .	81.66462
it was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car ' s starter .	18.73273
gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night .	71.25873
the fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union .	68.165276
gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union ' s battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 .	68.864716
the fire fighters association here offered a $5 , 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing .	69.62861
a $500 reward was offered by the association ' s local in kansas city , kas . .	27.16692
the association said it would post 24 hour guards at gladden ' s home and at those of james mining and eugene shiflett .	66.970566
mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and shiflett is a member of its executive committee .	25.981476
ankara , turkey , oct . 24 ( ap )	1.5757202
-- turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen . cemal gursel as president .	94.42441
an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct . 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d ' etat .	77.542175
by-passing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by gen . cedvet sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government .	47.471027
the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen . gursel as president .	115.96686
gen . gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months .	56.050964
the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned .	71.98188
party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own .	129.01585
vincent g . ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced monday by charles e . raymond , district attorney .	42.222694
ierulli will replace desmond d . connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by march 31 .	112.66052
ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in portland since november , 1959 .	58.04581
he is a graduate of portland university and the northwestern college of law .	96.87975
he is married and the father of three children .	6.7200913
helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , e . m . martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night .	58.813663
martin , who has been in office in washington , d . c . , for 13 months spoke at the council ' s annual meeting at the multnomah hotel .	19.729069
he told some 350 persons that the united states ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths .	117.07252
`` we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours ' ' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty .	72.893295
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the soviet union .	24.076838
he cited east germany where after 15 years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up ' ' .	81.31788
martin called for patience on the part of americans .	112.6124
`` the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build ' ' , he said .	52.059353
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said .	111.944244
`` we have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient ' ' , the assistant secretary said .	32.681595
economically , martin said , the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves .	152.703
private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves .	59.34913

the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portland ' s civil defense more plans for the city ' s schools in event of attack .	116.87818
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow .	139.07971
the board members , after hearing the coordination plea from mrs . ralph h . molvar , 1409 sw maplecrest dr . , said they thought they had already been cooperating .	51.031624
chairman c . richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go .	107.33987
dr . melvin w . barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful ' ' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district .	91.15091
`` los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster ' ' , he said .	31.31757
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following .	82.4744
mrs . molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand ' ' , said , `` we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn ' t be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children ' ' .	45.31505
dr . barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work ' ' .	71.6642
mrs . molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowe ' s program .	116.937996
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting .	110.10974
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done .	50.782307

a stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the assemblies of god , in session at the memorial coliseum .	74.29955
the council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination ' s 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 .	100.5599
the changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible .	74.57578
the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible .	137.84848
at the adoption , the rev . t . f . zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives ' ' .	42.389584
however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list .	77.623604
the first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads	109.34771
`` the scriptures , both old and new testament , are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct ' ' .	43.60642

`` surveys show that one out of three americans has vital contact with the church .	93.70017
this means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life ' ' , he told delegates friday .	75.8771
talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12 , 000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the united states every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge ' ' .	75.102104
`` in 35 years we have opened 7 , 000 churches ' ' , the rev . mr . brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10 , 000 persons .	40.371754
`` in this light we need 1 , 000 churches in illinois , where we have 200	64.78866
800 in southern new england , we have 60	4132.293
we need 100 in rhode island , we have none ' ' , he said .	14.232781
to step up the denomination ' s program , the rev . mr . brandt suggested the vision of 8 , 000 new assemblies of god churches in the next 10 years .	48.558178
to accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said .	111.196075

u . s . dist . judge charles l . powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in portland ' s insurance fraud trial .	107.72032
denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict .	38.061584
in denying motions for dismissal , judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are ' ' .	114.23251
attorney dwight l . schwab , in behalf of defendant philip weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy , but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide .	53.41587
schwab also declared there is no proof of weinstein ' s entering a conspiracy to use the u . s . mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor a . lawrence burbank replied	49.99962
`` it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the u . s . mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out ' ' .	36.53065
in the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case .	116.47254
-- the orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen major-league clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the kansas city athletics by a score of 5 to 3 .	122.95279
indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage .	95.255424
over the first five frames , jack fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 american league pennant , held the a ' s scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .	109.397255
then dick hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock .	267.75635
a two-run homer by norm siebern and a solo blast by bill tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .	131.99359
with one down in the eighth , marv throneberry drew a walk and stole second as hyde fanned tuttle .	48.044228
catcher frank house ' s throw in an effort to nab throneberry was wide and in the dirt .	111.62012
then heywood sullivan , kansas city catcher , singled up the middle and throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .	141.89877
rookie southpaw george stepanovich relieved hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the a ' s fifth tally on a walk to second baseman dick howser , a wild pitch , and frank cipriani ' s single under shortstop jerry adair ' s glove into center .	51.382294
the orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three kansas city pitchers .	89.285995
three were doubles , brooks robinson getting a pair and marv breeding one .	54.005966
bill kunkel , bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in miami stadium .	166.93567
the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth .	76.75669
hartman , purchased by the a ' s from the milwaukee braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph .	68.999275
keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally .	121.52828
in the ninth , robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left .	60.081882
whitey herzog , performing in right as the orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked keegan for a base on balls .	85.5697
pete ward was sent in for house and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to howser on the grass back of short .	101.61252
john powell , batting for adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and buddy barker , up for stepanovich , bounced out sharply to jerry lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest .	66.19677
the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding , along with robinson , the two birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on russ snyder ' s single to right and crossed on kunkel ' s wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate .	64.895645
the flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out .	163.98663
jackie brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .	141.63641
jim gentile bounced a hard shot off kunkel ' s glove and beat it out for a single , and when lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman throneberry ' s head brandt took third and gentile second on the error .	66.59191
then robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners .	245.68933
when robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , tuttle to andy carey .	73.53823
the detailed rundown on the kansas city scoring in the sixth went like this	189.65767
lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face hyde and romped around as siebern blasted hyde ' s next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center .	35.8667
carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first .	351.4697
it was ruled a difficult chance and a hit .	155.16194
then throneberry rapped into a fast double play .	9.369171
breeding to adair to gentile , setting up tuttle ' s 390-foot homer over the wall in left center .	47.521587
if the orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the american league champion new york yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test sunday afternoon .	42.78975
-- the flavor of baltimore ' s florida grapefruit league news ripened considerably late today when the orioles were advised that ron hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the army ' s military training program and is ready for belated spring training .	84.2321
hansen , who slugged the 1960 oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a	57.96734
freshman average , completes the birds ' spring squad at 49 players .	222.43097
the big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 american league `` rookie-of-the-year ' ' , flew here late this afternoon from baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15 , 000 and was a spectator at tonight ' s 5-to-3 loss to kansas city -- the winless birds ' sixth setback in a row .	63.016544
the 6-foot 3-inch hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring .	53.58662
he hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the flock breaks camp three weeks hence .	194.61714
when he was inducted into the army at fort knox , ky . , hansen ' s weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best ' ' he said .	38.537315
`` i feel good physically ' ' , hansen added , `` but i think i ' ll move better carrying a little less weight than i ' m carrying now ' ' .	42.084736
the rangy , albany ( cal . ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding ' ' as his 1961 goal .	74.3775
`` i think i can do a better job with the glove , now that i know the hitters around the league a little better ' ' , he said .	54.08703
hansen will engage in his first workout at miami stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the new york yankees .	49.09901
skinny brown and hoyt wilhelm , the flock ' s veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the american league champions in tomorrow ' s 8 p . m . contest .	25.58702
ryne duren and roland sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the yanks ' auburn ( n . y . ) farm club of the class-d new york-pennsylvania league , are the probable rival pitchers .	26.02725

pitcher steve barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the army ' s accelerated wintertime military course , also at fort knox , ky . .	52.65808
the 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did hansen .	390.95377
baltimore ' s bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as manager paul richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit .	92.69429
`` take a ride on this one ' ' , brooks robinson greeted hansen as the bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight .	61.498886
it was the first of two doubles by robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate .	42.853844
just before game time , robinson ' s pretty wife , connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer .	76.90796
unfortunately , brooks ' s teammates were not in such festive mood as the orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three kansas city rookie hurlers .	46.642067
hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with lee macphail	181.6131
j . a . w . iglehart , chairman of the oriole board of directors , and public relations director jack dunn .	25.829826

kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in new york with a clocking of 1 . 09 . 3 , wiped out mills ' s early pace and beat the young big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards .	60.110653
both were under the meet mark of 1 . 10 . 8 set in 1950 by mal whitfield .	42.158806
mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .	60.254917
then kerr , a graduate student from illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off mills ' s challenge on the final turn .	130.72502

-- two errors by new york yankee shortstop tony kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the chicago white sox today .	27.947594
-- a texas halfback who doesn ' t even know the team ' s plays , eldon moritz , ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games .	103.8313
time stands still every time moritz , a 26-year-old army signal corps veteran , goes into the field .	122.76503
although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every saturday , in fact -- out of football .	119.13135
moritz doesn ' t even have a nose guard or hip pads but he ' s one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl .	66.41775
that ' s because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries .	105.45021
he ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of washington state .	132.27914
moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team .	94.39767
but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and you ' ll get the quick response , `` place-kicker ' ' .	48.406303
a 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from stamford , moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .	224.47491
last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn ' t get into a single game .	60.13296
`` this year , coach royal told me if i ' d work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me ' ' , said moritz .	42.995094
`` so i started practicing on it in spring training .	229.40996
moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough .	73.69383
moritz said monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week .	57.789497
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school , including one that beat anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game .	75.08846
`` i kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school ' ' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time .	44.519573
i never did miss one in a playoff game -- i kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years ' ' .	47.683056
moritz came to texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury .	45.658974
he missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 .	91.33787
his statistical record that year , when texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards .	128.41792
he went into the army in march , 1957 , and returned two years later .	28.351793
but he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season .	347.88583
place kicking is largely a matter of timing , moritz declared .	63.907417
`` once you get the feel of it , there ' s not much to it .	22.641323
i ' ve tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can ' t seem to get the feel .	42.65753
practice helps you to get your timing down .	22.341326
`` it ' s kind of like golf -- if you don ' t swing a club very often , your timing gets off ' ' .	59.891895
moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session .	156.99251
`` if you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead ' ' , he explained .	23.243675
in their first three games , the longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent	83.45255
their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries .	64.11779
tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries	103.11252
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games .	31.700808
saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the washington state game , for four plays he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench .	78.46165
wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists he ' ll be ready for oklahoma .	144.81012
last week , when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conference ' s top four in rushing , he said `` that won ' t last long ' ' .	54.972183
monday , he had four longhorns in the top four .	100.42208
a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday , but attention quickly turned from saturday ' s victory to next week ' s problem rice university .	174.36885
the mustangs don ' t play this week .	2.385898
`` we ' re just real happy for the players ' ' , coach bill meek said of the 9-7 victory over the air force academy .	35.369167
`` i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on .	169.80782
it was the first time we ' ve been ahead this season ( when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) ' ' .	134.53777
assistant coach john cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , i think , on the part of the coaches and the players .	38.35869
we needed it and we got it ' ' .	1.3604311
meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon .	153.20361
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .	26.157034
`` nelson played magnificent football ' ' , meek praised .	41.845486
`` he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times .	128.4641
and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown .	141.01529
he broke that boy ( air force fullback nick arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football ' ' .	34.0269
gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages .	39.125767
one was on a fourth-down screen pass from the mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into gannon ' s territory .	101.174576
`` as soon as it started to form , gannon spotted it ' ' , meek said .	35.186012
`` he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback terry isaacson ) had time to turn around .	110.44581
he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss ' ' .	90.035416
the air force ' s , and the game ' s , final play , was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .	87.14133
`` he just lay back there and waited for it ' ' , meek said .	9.412472
`` he almost brought it back all the way ' ' .	5.8993454
except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice , meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice .	118.1371
`` kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game ' ' , meek said .	11.211115
`` he ' ll be out of action all this week .	94.05624
he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .	72.708755
there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee ' ' .	13.641599
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland .	59.353542
`` he ' s looking a lot better , and he ' s able to run ' ' , meek explained .	22.01539
`` we ' ll let him do a lot of running this week , but i don ' t know if he ' ll be able to play ' ' .	12.834241
the game players saw the air force film monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .	49.524796
`` we ' ll work hard tuesday , wednesday and thursday ' ' , meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage friday .	39.26153
we ' ll work out about an hour on saturday , then we ' ll work monday and tuesday of next week , then taper off ' ' .	67.9391
smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday , oct . 21 .	25.131517
-- held out of texas tech ' s sweat-suits drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the raiders ' 38-7 loss to texas a & m because of its important game with arkansas coming up saturday , baylor worked out in the rain monday -- mud or no mud .	97.157974
end gene raesz , who broke a hand in the owl ' s game with lsu , was back working out with rice monday , and john nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week ' s idleness with an ankle injury .	67.316376
the texas aggies got a day off monday -- a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night , but myers announced that halfback george hargett , shaken up in the tech game , would not play against trinity saturday .	104.03632
halfback bud priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined tcu ' s workout monday .	18.902687
the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the denver broncos -- but their visit will be a short one .	64.67798
the texans have two more road games -- at buffalo and houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach hank stram ' s men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .	81.599724
buffalo coach buster ramsey , who has become one of the game ' s greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-national football leaguers , m . c . reynolds and warren rabb .	42.814453
rabb , the former louisiana state field general , came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the houston oilers , defending league champions .	108.12325
`` buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ' ' .	70.25453
ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver , and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , jack spikes , though he did the team ' s place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .	74.01656
`` our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well ' ' , said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .	68.4275
`` in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job ' ' .	11.470583
the texans won the game through ball control , with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only 17 passes .	92.00194
`` we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack ' ' , explained stram .	61.280975
`` they can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble ' ' .	74.99253
the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans , but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .	92.13531
the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes , the flashy halfback .	61.054726
he was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards .	42.06722
the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denver ' s al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas .	77.803246
`` that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away ' ' , said stram , quipping , `` i think i ' ll put that play in the book ' ' .	26.672096
the early southwest conference football leaders -- texas , arkansas and texas a & m -- made a big dent in the statistics last week .	50.66739
texas ' 545-yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1 , 512 yards ( 1 , 065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new swc high .	39.18751
arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip tcu , and a & m , with a 38-point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .	77.69926
completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .	21.29302
texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to baylor ' s 126 ) , but idle baylor has the best defensive record ( 187 . 5 yards per game to texas ' 189 ) .	35.848
a & m has the best defense against passes , 34 . 7 yards per game .	51.68333
not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology .	78.08658
rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis , 5-3 .	99.88005
the husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the denver area .	106.672264
it was nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight .	39.562943
they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack .	89.30532
nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning .	15.232882
he has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .	89.36944
the bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in sunday ' s opener , and never lagged .	44.32734
dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bear ' s attack .	58.09801
after al paschal gruonded out , jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe .	62.32956
alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left .	47.867443
jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don wert ' s smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout .	60.10547
the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzer ' s glove .	41.923557
nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth .	43.53132
chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines ' infield roller accounted for the tallies .	21.78904
the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusik ' s double and outfield flies by porter and wert .	48.876186
gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth .	27.958551
despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1 48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play .	105.694214
chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusik ' s grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .	59.084663
cliff cook accounted for three of the tribe ' s eight hits .	15.966949
it was the season ' s first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order .	54.890045
the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark .	31.488783
mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ .	5.1190214
among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , patti waggin who is mrs . don rudolph when off the stage .	55.293755
lefty wyman carey , another denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at 8 o ' clock tuesday night .	52.31483
ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn .	155.16061
dallas , tex . , may 1 -- ( ap )	6.842196
-- kenny lane of muskegon , mich . , world ' s seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over rip randall of tyler , tex . , here monday night .	58.695744
st . paul-minneapolis , may 1 -- ( ap )	1.1441644
-- billy gardner ' s line double , which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field , drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a 6-5 victory over the chicago white sox monday .	70.2346
lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center .	45.664043
he came all the way around on gardner ' s hit before 5777 fans .	26.316427
it was gardner ' s second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year .	44.999874
turk lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while ray moore won his second game against a single loss .	96.91362
the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny green ' s double to left .	74.54769
the white sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly .	61.893127
jim landis ' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a 1-0 lead , but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard .	51.166233
al smith ' s 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and carreon ' s first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front .	70.89612
a double by green , allison ' s run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by lemon and gardner ' s solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth .	58.87194
ogden , utah , may 1 -- ( ap )	1.262971
-- boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball .	86.59571
`` i ' ve had it ' ' , he told a newsman .	14.380338
`` i know when my reflexes are gone and i ' m not going to be any 25th man on the ball club ' ' .	29.529535
this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout .	21.392778
jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games .	26.998178
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno , nev . , where his wife , former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen , awaited .	67.72791
she said , when she learned jackie was heading home `` i ' m just speculating , but i have to think jack feels he ' s hurting boston ' s chances ' ' .	41.671417
the union pacific railroad streamliner , city of san francisco , stopped in ogden , utah , for a few minutes .	26.447037
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him .	101.31931
the conductor said to ritchie `` i don ' t think you want to talk to him .	12.075476
you ' ll probably get a ball bat on the head .	10.61637
he ' s mad at the world ' ' .	1.3589065
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .	54.00071
`` i told him who i was and he was quite cold .	33.909946
i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( liston ) got was through a keyhole .	115.78773
he said he had never talked to liston ' ' .	3.957558
liston is bill liston , baseball writer for the boston traveler , who quoted jensen as saying	47.33006
just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging .	82.68763
and so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old warren spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the giants and the giants ' willie mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree sunday .	23.288301
both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime .	72.17328
of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahn ' s hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts .	83.36016
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone .	81.693985
and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` wish i was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer .	106.49306
the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days .	68.197296
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game ' s history .	19.60613
yes , with bob grove , carl hubbell , herb pennock , art nehf , vernon gomez , et al .	12.870764
spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player ' s ball player , as they say in the trade .	39.359848
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct . 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18 , 792 .	50.461346
`` spahnie doesn ' t know how to merely go through the motions ' ' , remarked enos slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .	80.40581
the spectacular mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .	62.114216
incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .	152.10585
bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyn ' s ebbetts field .	91.098816
ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies , the braves ' joe adcock , lou gehrig of the yankees , pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito , then with cleveland , made their history on the road .	29.49617
willie ' s big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle .	78.61358
this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you ' re an american or national fan and anti or pro-yankee .	83.12811
the record books , however , would favor the giants ' ace .	36.64048
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .	57.802612
willie ' s lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond mickey ' s .	64.66394
the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukee ' s park .	94.818924
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .	152.83777
the denver-area tv audience was privileged to see mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home .	76.1687
this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game ' s top rulers .	70.59932
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the `` living room athletic club ' ' when games were cut off .	93.68919
actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .	75.07046
this year , i am told , the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here .	148.21317
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .	76.713806
it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .	76.78835
you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy .	187.60306
this dissatisfaction led to howsam ' s request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .	60.769184
-- the powerful new york yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed cincinnati , crushing the reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage monday in the loosely played finale .	28.278036
with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries , the american league champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game .	59.496696
johnny blanchard , mantle ' s replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a 5-run first inning .	20.47733
hector lopez , subbing for berra , smashed a 3-run homer off bill henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth .	68.428375
the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors .	102.67214
the crowd of 32 , 589 had only two chances to applaud .	52.54332
in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on .	100.295746
momentarily the reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .	105.26463
in the fifth , wally post slashed a 2-run homer off bud daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn ' t matter .	40.650684
the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager .	75.77821
only bucky harris , the `` boy-manager ' ' of washington in 1924 , and eddie dyer of the st . louis cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .	38.852776
-- nick skorich , the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles , was elevated today to head coach .	96.443405
skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20 , 000 and $25 , 000 a year .	39.26477
he succeeds buck shaw , who retired at the end of last season .	22.494476
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaw ' s staff -- jerry williams and charlie gauer .	43.96824
skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings , the newest national football league entry .	95.80784
van brocklin , the quarterback who led the eagles to the title , was signed by the vikings last wednesday .	71.13482
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .	66.553055
with skorich at the helm , the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .	82.52306
in the past the club depended largely on van brocklin ' s aerials .	16.475008
skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing .	183.71341
skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at cincinnati university and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers .	62.15113
an injury forced skorich to quit after the 1948 season .	37.011097
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in 1949 .	39.571087
he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy , n . y . .	27.738825
he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach .	64.3843
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers .	85.71925
the eagles signed him for shaw ' s staff in 1959 .	25.815063
at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth , the eagles were honored for winning the championship .	41.303288
shaw and skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .	97.98637
with the announcement of a `` special achievement award ' ' to william a . ( ( bill ) shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for sunday night ' s thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the new york chapter , baseball writers ' association of america , at the waldorf-astoria hotel .	48.527355

a crowd of 1 , 400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song .	43.835567
the 53-year-old shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york .	76.5727
named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james a . farley , bernard gimbel and clint blume , shea worked relentlessly .	121.230385
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city .	25.09673
the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees .	195.95639
despite countless barriers and disappointments , shea moved forward .	39.114956
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another national league club to move here .	123.667015
when that failed , he enlisted branch rickey ' s aid in the formation of a third major league , the continental , with new york as the key franchise .	44.64766
the continental league never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand .	103.63325
the new york franchise is headed by mrs . charles shipman payson .	5.646191
a big-league municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford c . frick .	78.92088
shea ' s efforts figure prominently in the new stadium .	62.21384
shea and his wife , nori , make their home at sands point , l . i . .	123.391945
bill jr . , 20 , kathy , 15 , and patricia , 9 , round out the shea family .	127.69568
he attended new york university before switching to georgetown university in washington .	32.78827
he played basketball there while working toward a law degree .	636.4209
later , shea owned and operated the long island indians , a minor league professional football team .	31.167841
he was the lawyer for ted collins ' old boston yankees in the national football league .	60.033028
all was quiet in the office of the yankees and the local national leaguers yesterday .	127.12956
on friday , roger maris , the yankee outfielder and winner of the american league ' s most-valuable-player award , will meet with roy hamey , the general manager .	33.648502
maris is in line for a big raise .	5.05228
arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight .	131.11806
the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre .	89.75923
palmer , golf ' s leading money-winner in 1960 , and snead will be saluted as the winning team in the canada cup matches last june in dublin .	51.579056
deane beman , the national amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including bob gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards .	46.4463
the writers ' gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield , n . j . , and palm beach , fla . , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments .	17.299114
horton smith of detroit , a former president of the professional golfers association , will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness .	49.891903
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington , democrat of missouri .	78.588875
arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .	52.32052
he won the masters , the united states open and a record $80 , 738 in prize money .	109.98801
he was heralded as `` sportsman of the year ' ' by sports illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the `` professional athlete of the year ' ' , a distinction that earned for him the $10 , 000 diamond-studded hickok belt .	36.024677
but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .	87.01667
a couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole .	79.018745
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .	59.724857
if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .	122.805664
it was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold .	265.16083
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .	358.19165
the world ' s best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .	72.40537
then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .	45.38228
on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , arnold whipped into his second shot .	44.275414
the ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice .	25.982437
he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .	6.767606
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .	15.035839
`` it is possible that i over-corrected ' ' , he said ruefully .	12.783424
each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .	90.339676
`` it was a nice round figure , that 12 ' ' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed .	54.430798
from the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open .	212.16972
the idol of the hackers , of course , is ray ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the united states open .	37.34043
their secondary hero is another pro , willie chisholm , who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully .	46.523796
willie ' s partner was long jim barnes , who tried to keep count .	55.018154
`` how many is that , jim ' ' ? ?	3.0066981
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project .	150.29399
`` thirteen ' ' , said long jim .	7.9800606
`` nae , man ' ' , said willie , `` ye must be countin ' the echoes ' ' .	67.71196
nor were there any rules to save him .	4.7721925
if there had been , he would have found a loophole , because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .	100.55438
this knowledge has come in handy , too .	20.782364
his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .	64.825935
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .	71.493706
arnold sent for joe dey , the executive secretary of the golf association .	48.193005
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .	113.71318
`` i knew it all along ' ' , confessed arnold with a grin , `` but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there ' ' .	80.14361
for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .	77.10944
he ' ll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he ' s right .	67.53732
that ' s how he first won the masters in 1958 .	44.797672
it happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder .	212.36589
arnold ' s iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force .	46.823067
`` i can remove the ball , can ' t i ' ' ? ?	7.8125625
`` no ' ' , said the official .	159.43726
`` you must play it where it lies ' ' .	1.7234577
`` you ' re wrong ' ' , said arnold , a man who knows the rules .	61.55008
`` i ' ll do as you say , but i ' ll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling ' ' .	49.530743
he scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one .	103.95113
so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .	77.06236
until a few weeks ago , however , arnold palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers .	72.92024
but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before .	56.970352
a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today .	88.32787
other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football ' s hall of fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments .	127.94471
the owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division .	168.51843
however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .	109.35308
pete rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out	2.6136367
`` we ' ll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other ' ' .	66.71462
nine of the league ' s teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .	127.810814
if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies , they won ' t be misled by the pirates ' slower start this season .	41.381527
`` pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat ' ' , mauch said here the other day .	40.646187
`` the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year .	237.48833
they have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season , along with bobby shantz ' ' .	57.971436
tonight at 8 o ' clock the cardinals , who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball ' s world champions .	109.16121
the pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the redbirds are 7-9 .	25.328133
solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from bob gibson to ernie broglio , for several reasons 1 broglio ' s 4-0 won-lost record and 1 . 24 earned-run mark against pittsburgh a year ago	64.59624
2 the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible	165.25214
3 the redbirds ' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the phillies sunday .	34.625816
manager hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment .	173.87749
after thursday ' s open date , solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night .	135.57777
harvey haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonight ' s game at busch stadium .	65.117676
haddix has a 13-8 record against the redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 .	31.39668
pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadn ' t decided between mizell and vern law for wednesday ' s game .	89.04606
after a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup .	41.291264
that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the giants .	77.22477
`` i have to stay with nieman for a while ' ' , hemus said .	14.097051
`` bill white ( sore ankles ) should be ready .	33.218876
with a lefthander going for pittsburgh , i may use don taussig in center ' ' .	56.20467
`` lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good ' ' , hemus said .	18.368896
`` he should be getting back in the groove before long .	158.39716
our pitching is much better than it has shown ' ' .	26.07653
the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice , but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday .	128.4459
until the bucs ' bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .	104.43315
despite the recession , pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess , gino cimoli , bill virdon , bob clemente and dick groat , each	34.17588
bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet .	100.144485
perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend , who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs .	212.91382
friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn ' t likely to see action here this week .	65.20564
`` we ' re getting friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good ' ' , murtaugh said .	40.724808
the pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by may 1 last year , when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season .	75.93049
on last may 1 , the cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone .	55.51904
in 1958 , the birds were 3-10 on may 1 .	41.279404
since 1949 , the st . louis club has been below on may 1 just four times .	74.0135
the ' 49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on may 23 before finishing with 96 victories .	70.651245
the ' 52 cards were 6-7 on may 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club ' s top since 1949 .	71.193825
then last season the birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on may 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .	82.21177
since 1949 , the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the ' 55 dodger team .	59.81917
those dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by may 8 .	86.942055
the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new york ' s ' 51 giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .	57.517006
speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st . louis university players who , in the words of coach john benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than i did ' ' .	53.78249
the most valuable player award was split three ways , among glen mankowski , gordon hartweger and tom kieffer .	79.82065
in addition , a special award was given to bob ( bevo ) nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury .	30.698729
`` you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing ' ' , benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different .	74.26665
the boys had a tremendous respect for each other ' s ability .	23.205408
they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do .	50.60316
`` several times i found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .	90.72998
we ' d be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say , ' don ' t worry , coach -- we ' ll get ' em all right ' ' ' .	59.635532
the trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by bob broeg , sports editor of the post-dispatch .	27.284336
kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play .	42.036297
mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against bradley in st . louis u . ' s nationally televised victory .	44.662266
benington said , `` i ' ve never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day ' ' .	95.818535
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills .	102.801315
after the coach listed all the boy ' s faults , hartweger said , `` coach before i leave here , you ' ll get to like me ' ' .	36.354794
mrs . benington admired gordon ' s spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team .	65.98022
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` i want to thank coach ' s wife for talking him into letting me play ' ' .	59.75047
bob burnes , sports editor of the globe-democrat , presented bob nordmann with his award .	108.39241
bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time .	104.792305
within a week after the injury , suffered in st . louis ' s victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament , nordmann was sitting on the bill ' s bench doing what he could to help benington .	34.441338
on the clock given him was the inscription , `` for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball , 1960-61 ' ' .	52.46503
other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the national invitation tournament were art hambric , donnell reid , bill nordmann , dave harris , dave luechtefeld and george latinovich .	67.02442
`` this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future ' ' , benington pointed out .	33.974785
`` by winning against bradley , kentucky and notre dame on those teams ' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn ' t take a super team to do it ' ' .	66.85439
st . louis university found a way to win a baseball game .	28.835358
larry scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in billiken baseball history , as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college , 5-1 , at crystal city .	93.65131
the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie .	114.90276
the tie was against southeast missouri last friday .	2.5482962
scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , len boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple .	35.1974
st . louis u . was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against washington university at ligget field .	307.09778
the game opened a busy week for washington .	2.937293
the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at 3 30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy , ill . , saturday .	119.32453
if it ' s true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn ' t happy ball players produce more base hits ? ?	171.70512
the two top talents of the time , mickey mantle and willie mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations .	147.52316
and that ' s meant as a boost , not a knock .	66.80242
mays and mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they ' ve never hit the heights .	168.97765
mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the american league in home runs , 52 , and rbi ' s , 130 .	64.131516
like the yankees ' slugger , mays , the terror of the giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- willie .	157.33928
his best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and ' 55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases .	46.83259
now , apparently happier under new managers , mays and mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they ' re going to pass those previous peaks .	98.756485
yes , we know , they ' re professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn ' t care how they ' re handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .	48.584038
the truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment .	111.24466
for that matter , stan musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort .	78.959885
mantle , it ' s apparent , resented casey stengel ' s attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility .	64.87485
stengel inherited dimaggio , rizzuto , but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors , from joplin to new york .	152.74283
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , ol ' case wanted no . 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder .	91.23101
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats .	59.573544
inheriting a more mature mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off broadway , ralph houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on mickey .	202.87085
the major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead .	265.02734
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far .	51.246056
the opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in los angeles ' wrigley field jr . , mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , babe ruth ' s 60 homers of 1927 .	77.57165
mays ' day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year .	126.23241
willie ' s wonderful walloping sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark .	127.62939
next to leo durocher , dark taught mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the polo grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the giants win a dramatic pennant .	88.592896

those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation army ' s social center at 1200 larimer st . .	47.547405
the pert , gray-haired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo , n . y . , is a `` civilian ' ' with the army .	25.231554
her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director .	240.1359
the job also covers a number of other items .	31.179792
`` mom ' ' marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society .	199.25183
her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during may , which is national salvation army week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , mrs . marr ' s office is always open and the welcome mat is out .	110.96943
mrs . marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up .	207.6221
she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures .	127.68673
`` usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men ' ' , mrs . marr explained .	52.37753
the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center .	54.220478
`` and i bum tickets to everything i can ' ' , she said .	9.546953
`` i ' ve become the greatest beggar in the world ' ' .	4.052473
in addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , mrs . marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system .	76.41047
mrs . marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother ' ' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society .	64.03532

my husband and i , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from tucson , ariz . , to new york city	51.3328
i can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting .	102.87698
i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations .	140.8849
maybe motel-keeping isn ' t the nation ' s biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway .	69.43333
there are motels for all purposes and all tastes .	157.33815
there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock , tex . , as i discovered .	33.55609
there the royal motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free tv , storm cellar ' ' .	49.599594
innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk ' ' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) .	75.48832
some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children .	85.54889
but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar .	130.53366
motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated ' ' signs on farm houses and village homes before world war 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business .	70.2815
at the boxwood motel in winchester , va . , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels .	45.337685
that made up for the `` best ' ' motel in norman , okla . , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8 . 50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture .	84.92812

the baltimore and ohio railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12 01 a . m . next saturday .	48.90822
the current monthly payroll comes to about $15 , 000 , 000 .	4.161576
howard e . simpson , the railroad ' s president , said , `` a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action ' ' .	38.691875
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b . & o . operates .	31.184782
a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions .	74.912544
there are about 3 , 325 officers and employees in this class .	28.16527
sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense .	46.261288
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a b . & o . spokesman said .	132.53218
those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages .	75.158745
the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job .	87.80054
a thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at franklin and mount streets .	92.73899

the driver told police he followed as the negro man got out of the cab with his money .	75.12381
the victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit .	44.866135
he said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at pennsylvania avenue and gold street .	34.985962
in another attack , samuel verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block aiken street , told police two negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him .	95.56793
a baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room anne arundel county home .	68.522675
the victim darnell somerville , negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at anne arundel general hospital in annapolis .	52.076984
his sister and brother , marie louise , 3 , and john raymond , jr . 22 months , were admitted to the hospital .	43.181374
the girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body .	32.37188
the boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back .	51.054054
police said the children ' s mother , mrs . eleanor somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred .	79.44829
the house is on old annapolis road a mile south of severna park , at jones station , police said .	36.234314
-- the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what .	82.358826
the proposal was made by dr . david s . jenkins after he and mrs . d . ellwood williams , jr . , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week ' s meeting .	54.744892
the disagreement was over what dr . jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting .	94.29667
mrs . williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr . jenkins ' s conversation and how they were written up for the board ' s approval .	83.02076
`` i hate to have these things come up again and again ' ' , dr . jenkins commented as he made his suggestion .	54.258327
`` these are the board ' s minutes .	11.785218
i ' ll write what you tell me to ' ' .	7.216166
for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago .	119.904076
it was about that time , a board member said later , that dr . thomas g . pullen , jr . , state superintendent of schools , told dr . jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him .	42.297295
the board of county commissioners , the sanitary commission , the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings .	114.04523
dr . jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the state do not do so .	41.902813
state senator joseph a . bertorelli ( d . , first baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of west pratt street .	84.14218
he was taken to university hospital in a municipal ambulance .	88.15771
doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side .	11.511723
his condition was said to be , `` fair ' ' .	12.191162
police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 west pratt street .	33.331444
he called vincent l . piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance .	41.901356
the vice president of the city council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies ' ' in the city ' s snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible .	29.875698
councilman william d . schaefer ( d . , fifth ) said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month .	87.1196
conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm , mr . schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here .	165.18423
he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december .	180.7039
equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall ' ' , mr . schaefer said .	18.8641
the councilman , who is the administration floor leader , also criticized bernard l . werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations ' ' on tuesday night after the sunday storm .	50.92741
mr . werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week .	38.446342
what he did , mr . werner said , was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest .	118.52445
mr . schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced ' ' .	103.43276
admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive ' ' .	97.25235
recounting personal observations of clearance work , the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes .	146.79234
-- the 15-year-old adopted son of a washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their chesapeake bay-front home , has been sent to spring grove state hospital for detention .	79.716385
the victims were h . malone dresbach , 47 , and his wife , shirley , 46 .	28.247868
each had been shot in the back several times with a	27.687347
automatic rifle , according to capt . elmer hagner , chief of anne arundel detectives .	11.698548
judge benjamin michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the anne arundel county jail .	46.156418
the circuit court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in juvenile court .	31.248684
soon after 10 a . m . , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the franklin manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the dresbach ' s other son , lee , 14 , they found mrs . dresbach ' s body on the first-floor bedroom floor .	93.256
her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said .	15.738185
the younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother ' s car .	47.949696
the description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout southern maryland on police radio .	466.71222
police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the dresbachs .	161.65578
trooper j . a . grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a route 2 service station , just outside annapolis .	157.88437
the driver admitted he was the dresbachs ' son and all three were taken to the edgewater station , police said .	52.3436
-- governor tawes today appointed lloyd l . simpkins , his administrative assistant , as maryland ' s secretary of state .	29.952452
mr . simpkins will move into the post being vacated by thomas b . finan , earlier named attorney general to succeed c . ferdinand sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the maryland court of appeals .	46.205193
governor tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next friday .	42.739624
mr . simpkins is a resident of somerset county , and he and the governor , also a somerset countian , have been friends since mr . simpkins was a child .	41.643677
now 38 , mr . simpkins was graduated from the university of maryland ' s college of agriculture in 1947 .	16.415302
five years later , he was awarded the university ' s degree in law .	56.69572
mr . simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the house of delegates from 1951 through 1958 .	24.605505
from the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the house of delegates .	45.786156
maryland contracts for future construction during october totaled $77 , 389 , 000 , up to 10 per cent compared to october , 1960 , f . w . dodge , dodge corporation , reported .	18.814327

residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter .	50.722916
the share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time .	62.399265
in 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction .	69.149506
while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field .	90.47072
although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , leo j . pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .	77.99038
`` convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today .	220.05878
trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 ' ' , pantas predicted .	57.23739
sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit harbor view apartments in the cherry hill section .	553.0043
ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures .	58.496494
various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct .	81.61595
others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies .	108.930595
the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction .	90.4391
heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems .	52.472538
construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by johns-manville corporation .	25.385303
-- vital secrets of britain ' s first atomic submarine , the dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire united states navy ' s still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a london-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today .	46.677105
the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in 1959 and was launched last year .	32.229073
it is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs .	195.4394
it has a hull patterned on that of the united states navy ' s nautilus , the world ' s first atomic submarine .	15.627858
its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack .	24.43204
the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow st . police court here at the end of a three day hearing .	96.82327
two british civil servants , miss ethel gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , harry houghton , 55 , and divorced .	36.303993
they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard .	151.021
gordon a . lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport .	205.62244
when arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in christmas gift wrapping , it was testified .	79.72738
a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger , bookseller , and wife , joyce .	18.3699
( in washington , the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen , an american couple formerly of new york city )	44.158607
in their suburban cottage the crown charges , the krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books .	124.9515
each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript .	69.85884
her young british lawyer , james dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop .	72.26543
`` i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them ' ' , said the magistrate , k . j . p . baraclough .	19.075623
the trial will be held , probably the first week of march , in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs , the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison .	126.0531
fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s .	90.3047
fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior .	145.64333
the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29 , 000 in american and british currency , mostly $20 bills , and in british government bonds and stocks .	85.15822
`` this is russian money ' ' , said mervin griffith-jones for the attorney general ' s office .	22.619919
he asserted that the krogers were the bankers for moscow , lonsdale the red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country ' s secrets .	89.950195
the fact that secrets of the dreadnought , and thereby of the american undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier .	63.433975
but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navy ' s chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , capt . george symonds .	40.148403
he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon , jan . 7 .	80.45601
the information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .	79.53751
just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold .	132.96555
the british defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve .	135.51366
so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour .	105.54946
almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet .	67.418465
britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed .	116.95445
the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack .	76.63235
with the machinery went a complete design for the hull .	14.955981
the skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the nautilus and the other four which preceded it .	88.89189
`` much of the navy ' s future depends upon her ' ' , an american naval announcement said on the skipjack ' s first arrival in british waters in august , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at portland underwater research station .	79.999664
it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work .	81.91113
`` her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent polaris missile submarines ' ' , the statement went on .	62.8032
the atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric corp . .	39.200237
thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said .	40.82647
the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work .	17.489294
it was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the albacore , in 1954 .	40.95096
the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built .	3.4464567
reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers .	26.599955
it could , reputedly , go 70 , 000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month .	30.109959
it was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes .	139.3039
the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in miss gee ' s purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future ' ' .	92.5805
the spy ring also was particularly interested in asdic , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified .	70.209755
six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in lonsdale ' s apartment and the krogers ' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid .	89.82097
oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested .	33.555748
the charge that the federal indictment of three chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity ' ' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before judge joseph sam perry in federal district court .	92.11962
the three -- miles j . cooperman , sheldon teller , and richard austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws .	60.09936
in his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , bernard h . sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent ' ' .	38.220814
`` when they became members of the city police narcotics unit ' ' , sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket .	63.257664
they , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers ' ' .	7.594236
although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals ' ' .	47.43004
this , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies ' ' and `` petty personal grievances ' ' .	7.8300962
`` in the same five year period that the united states says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy ' ' , sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the lambert tree award and the mayor ' s medal ' ' .	49.88101
in opening , d . arthur connelly , assistant united states attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments .	128.42766
attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients ' guilt .	36.511806
cooperman and teller are accused of selling $4 , 700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , otis sears , 45 , of 6934 indiana av . .	25.471933
among other acts , teller and austin are accused of paying $800 to sears .	85.84991
the first witness , moses winston mardis , 5835 michigan av . , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made .	47.953434
but court adjourned after he testified he introduced james white and jeremiah hope pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced pullings to jessy maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted .	75.294556
buaford robinson , 23 , of 7026 stewart av . , a cta bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st street and south park way .	38.54702
robinson was treated at a physician ' s office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee .	68.545815
his losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck .	22.658415
robinson told policemen james jones and morgan lloyd of the wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of dunbar vocational high school , 30th street and south park way , and began `` skylarking ' ' .	71.75464

-- a jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old richard pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of mrs . anna hengesbach .	53.0716
he returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last july , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , jack walker , or his guard .	84.57363
the verdict brought vindication to the dead woman ' s stepson , vincent hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in december , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict .	34.861233
mrs . hengesbach was killed on aug . 31 , 1958 .	10.878013

hengesbach has been living in grand ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 .	76.46368

a verdict against pohl came at 4 05 p . m . after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation .	9.804736
the jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of walker after the verdict was announced .	82.76377

mrs . pankowski , 61 , remained in holy cross hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while mrs . kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother ' s small upstairs flat at 2274 eight mile road east .	74.57998
assistant fire chief chester cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity .	86.228294
christine ' s twin sister , patricia , and darlene kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns .	34.56146
they are home now with the other kowalski children , vicky , 14	73.75374

neighbor women , such as mrs . sidney baker , 2269 serra , sterling township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with kowalski ' s sister-in-law , mrs . anna kowalski , 22111 david , east detroit .	54.457188
another neighbor , mrs . frank c . smith , 2731 pall mall , sterling township , surprised kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs .	153.98573

there also were reports of a collection at the county line elementary school , 3505o dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the kowalski children including christine .	51.072777
kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last saturday .	219.16699
but today he wanted to make a public statement .	46.340794
`` i never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family .	48.33136
i wasn ' t sure there were such people anywhere in the world .	49.291214
i ' ll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them ' ' .	58.76696

a havana radio broadcast identified the americans as howard anderson and august jack mcnair .	137.76266
the executions took place at dawn only a few hours after havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at pinar del rio , where the executions took place .	39.574604
the broadcast said anderson , a seattle ex-marine and havana businessman , and mcnair , of miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to cuban rebels .	61.297897
anderson operated three havana automobile service stations and was commander of the havana american legion post before it disbanded since the start of fidel castro ' s regime .	99.79299

emory university ' s board of trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state ' s tax laws made such a step possible .	58.438313
`` emory university ' s charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race ' ' , board chairman henry l . bowden stated .	82.12455
but an official statement adopted by the 33-man emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes .	93.64452
the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated .	59.840714
`` emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions ' ' , the statement said .	69.24886
the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation .	58.20332
an emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws .	47.037663
the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people ' ' .	111.08267
at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state .	99.48241
some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation .	105.88166
the student newspaper , the emory wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation .	113.315926
`` from its beginning ' ' , the trustees ' statement said friday , `` emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning .	68.41373
teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under christian influence , are paramount in the emory university policy .	102.16473
`` as a private institution , supported by generous individuals , emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education .	79.34974
`` there is not now , nor has there ever been in emory university ' s charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed .	65.26698
insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , emory university could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed .	57.918297
`` on the other hand , emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia .	104.88979
`` when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education ' ' .	53.049885

the atlanta negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins ' ' if negotiations failed .	151.00768
the demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the committee on appeal for human rights .	98.90271
`` we intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year ' ' , the identically worded letters said .	21.377104
the letters set a nov . 15 deadline for the start of negotiations .	23.533525
they indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate .	392.66193
downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted friday night for comment on the coahr request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the friday mail .	62.740585
however , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend .	43.673496
the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday .	77.54713
several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair .	51.968517
student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago .	31.188745
charles a . black , coahr chairman , said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on oct . 31 but had failed to show up .	98.12397
friday ' s letters asked for a nov . 15 meeting .	41.940346
failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference ' ' .	43.80672
black said coahr `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal ' '	92.188
a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that `` extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits ' '	131.84822
besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and buckhead .	75.35507

at the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17 , 000 .	51.963623

no request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however .	106.49027
the commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , roy webster , of hood river , and dr . ennis keizer , of north bend , approved a year ' s contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past .	47.323647
the contract with ray field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month .	83.074776
field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .	76.21629
acting administrator andrew f . juras said that because of field ' s unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period .	79.92615
but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past ' ' .	65.54066
he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave ' ' .	108.70909
juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government .	52.603058
he also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest ' ' in terms of the man ' s responsibility .	47.830986
the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added field ' s long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program .	119.56575

asked mrs . grace o . peck , representative from multnomah county , of the commission chairman , joseph e . harvey jr . .	62.25459
`` my feeling at the moment ' ' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him .	27.273832
the continued operation of this program depends on having his service ' ' .	70.1809
mrs . peck , later joined by the commission ' s vice-chairman , mrs . lee patterson , took harvey to task for comments he had made to the north portland rotary club tuesday .	92.84948
a publicity release from oregon physicians service , of which harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to salem , instead of `` crippling ' ' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between f & a and the commission staff .	114.536476
`` i rather resent ' ' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in portland as though just the move accomplished this .	138.1797
i think you fell short of the real truth in the matter that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people .	64.479546
the staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles ' ' .	83.17728
harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare ' ' .	76.90848

about 200 of the special v-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead .	20.12849
the target was allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe .	22.260912
the success of the project depended upon fiedler ' s flight .	14.713746
squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket ' s automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude .	132.49257
at 12 , 000 feet , fiedler signaled `` release ' ' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the heinkel .	53.192272
to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m . p . h . .	48.385925
it was probably man ' s first successful flight in a missile .	62.907986
`` she flew beautifully ' ' , said fiedler .	49.106655
`` there was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow .	51.95537
i had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip ' ' .	36.90959
using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket ' s tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage .	83.44114
he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m . p . h . -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield .	70.934364
moments later the v-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed .	89.16184
fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles .	133.19563
the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb .	32.998737
pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships .	80.21487
a crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into allied hands .	52.72072
now a family man with three children , fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale .	43.201466
his spare time is spent in soaring gliders .	6.5059733
`` it ' s so quiet ' ' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging ' ' .	28.285393

members of the san francisco american friends service , a quaker organization , will march to san francisco for a rally in union square at 2 p . m . saturday .	55.044083
in a letter to the american friends service , dr . schweitzer wrote	38.833828
`` leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out .	132.45529
`` they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack .	106.59919
the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons	132.25076
`` governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger	116.34593
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency ' ' .	31.174349
a federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant ' ' and operator of a janitors ' service .	53.425194
before he testified for 20 minutes , stein , who lives at 3300 lake shore dr . , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums .	76.788795
among his gangland buddies , he said , were joseph ( joey ) glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , gus ( slim ) alex , ralph pierce , joe ( caesar ) divarco , and jimmy ( monk ) allegretti .	49.92417
another hoodlum , louis arger , drew $39 , 000 from stein ' s janitor firm , the national maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , stein disclosed in an interview .	56.725437
`` i put arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at navy pier ' ' , stein said .	79.06183
`` but arger never was able to produce it , so i cut him off my payroll ' ' .	56.4843
other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including glimco and alex .	97.552704
the federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing stein ' s fees as a labor consultant .	62.591717
under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to stein ' s national maintenance company at 543 madison st . .	70.03795
the company supplies janitors and workmen for mccormick place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses .	50.50305
among the witnesses were ed j . lee , director of mccormick place	205.03569
jerome leavitt , a partner in the union liquor company , 3247 s . kedzie av . , dominic senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of stein and a cousin of tony accardo , onetime gang chief	28.444052
and frank w . pesce , operator of a glimco dominated deodorant firm , the best sanitation and supply company , 1215 blue island av . .	39.89829
lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in april with stein to supply and supervise janitors in mccormick place .	78.21313
stein ' s fee , lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors ' pay .	24.033411
stein estimated this amount at `` about $1 , 500 or $1 , 600 a month ' ' .	26.000965
leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12 , 500 his liquor firm paid to stein for `` labor consultant work ' ' with five unions which organized leavitt ' s workers .	84.423546
leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman ' s local , the teamsters union , a salesman ' s union , the janitors ' union , and a bottling workers ' union .	28.169415
government attorneys , leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans ' ' totaling about $40 , 000 which the liquor company made to stein in the last year .	65.518776
all of the loans , in amounts up to $5 , 000 each , have been repaid by stein , according to leavitt .	33.748154
stein said he needed the money , leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll ' ' at national maintenance company .	33.15695
the deodorant firm run by pesce has offices in the headquarters of glimco ' s discredited taxi drivers ' union at 1213-15 blue island av . .	35.042076
the radiation station of the chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over chicago yesterday .	217.02478
the reading , which has been watched with interest since russia ' s detonation of a super bomb monday , was 4 on tuesday and 7 last saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health .	105.24851
the weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week .	130.34906
a board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation .	27.155588
curtis allen huff , 41 , of 1630 lake av . , wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the first federal savings and loan association , 1 s . dearborn st . , where he formerly was employed as an attorney .	56.72127
federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20 , 000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10 , 000 .	38.798367
huff ' s attorney , antone f . gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic ' s liens on property on which the association held mortgages .	86.63858
huff told gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living ' ' .	87.63177
huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from october of 1955 until september of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative .	80.416046
huff lives with his wife , sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25 , 000 home with a $17 , 000 mortgage .	45.088787
the complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by leo blaber , an attorney for the association .	49.928837
the shortage was discovered after huff failed to report for work on sept . 18 .	88.18895
on that date , according to gregorio , huff left his home and took a room in the new lawrence hotel at 1020 lawrence av . .	60.200554
there , gregorio said , huff wrote a complete statement of his offense .	48.564026
later , huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the sherman house , using a credit card .	79.47565
when huff attempted to cash another $100 check there monday , hotel officials called police .	163.69835
-- greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay $28 , 700 , 000 to greek victims of nazi persecution , it was announced today .	62.87628
probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week .	65.374565
for many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous .	118.65077
it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock	66.354
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell .	66.825645
investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many .	170.49275
in fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares .	34.023582
some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers .	25.994339
a measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began .	79.16093
the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12 . 50 a share .	54.199398
the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler , guerin & turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share .	36.52535
and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around $22 a share .	134.01787
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market .	31.10638
indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up .	222.5184
letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185 , 000 to the public at $12 . 50 , with another 5 , 000 reserved for morton foods employes at $11 . 50 a share ) .	53.79694
there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering .	203.6701
`` we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas .	60.18307
cable confirmation ' ' , it said translated .	9.748453
but e . g . t . could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares .	120.88455
after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone .	238.9637
but the result of it all was , e . g . t . partner dean guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation .	63.91796
`` i feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' ' ' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country .	77.66666
he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do .	181.19408
but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one ? ?	178.19067
the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances .	20.664467
first , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up .	89.740746
as a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) .	79.0656
second , the `` potato chip industry ' ' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- frito and h . w . lay -- on the market .	66.30905
both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast run-up .	149.19003
and third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth ' ' industry in the public mind of late .	53.46588
foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant ' ' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios .	144.96349
the potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger .	67.38555
the history of the u . s . potato chip industry is that many of today ' s successful companies got started during the deep depression days .	89.24756
those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest .	116.86643
but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms .	201.02698
so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito .	238.83041
all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is .	95.61944
now , if morton ' s newest product , a corn chip known as chip-o ' s , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to .	93.43141
dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars .	48.532368
more than 10 companies maintain facilities in dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at sherman .	81.15941
it is no coincidence that the texas cotton ginner ' s association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history .	59.249905
the exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the state fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars .	60.2596
it weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year .	123.70152
a modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250 , 000 , and it ' s a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the u . s . and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area .	26.337101
the murray co . of texas , inc . , originated in dallas in 1896 .	45.392307

the john e . mitchell co . began work in dallas in 1928 .	83.77898
the firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment .	85.32772
the increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation .	147.56326
mitchell employs a total of about 400 people .	40.941917
the hinckley gin supply co . is a maker of `` overhead equipment ' ' .	44.77261

new car sales in dallas county during march showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year .	126.291595
registrations of new cars in dallas county cracked the 3 , 000 mark in march for the first time this year .	34.89795
totaling 3 , 399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over february ' s 2 , 963 .	19.242132
however , compared with march 1960 new car sales of 4 , 441 , this march was off 23 per cent .	58.563286
on a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9 , 273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year ' s 3-month total of 11 , 744 .	66.3941
this year-to-year decline for dallas county closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the u . s . for first three months of 1961 were about 1 , 212 , 000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier .	28.941273
with the march pickup , dealers are optimistic that the april-june quarter will equal or top last year .	159.24738
the march gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter .	93.85252
on the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars .	55.27156
only three standard models -- buick , chrysler , and mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in march sales in the county .	72.3967

the kennedy administration ' s new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the federal housing administration , came under fire in dallas last week .	98.62651
the administration ' s proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated caron s . stallard , first vice-president of the mortgage bankers association of america .	76.17844
-- `` the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn ' ' , beryl w . sprinkel , economist of harris trust & savings bank , chicago , predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn . , california group , conference .	123.90401
another speaker , william h . draper , jr . , former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper , gaither & anderson , urged the u . s . to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we won ' t be pushed around any more ' ' .	50.24189
he urged support for president kennedy ' s requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations .	55.57718
sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan ' ' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern .	116.8954
`` in view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial ' ' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 ' ' .	85.475296
sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence ' ' .	95.189766
rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth ' ' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery ' ' .	73.898705
he cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation ' ' .	115.10501
the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 ' ' .	67.99585
the unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike .	142.47044
draper declared , `` as i see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today .	109.487755
we must be ready for any needed sacrifice ' ' .	3.1745648
he said that from his experience of two years with gen . clay in west berlin administration , that `` russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we ' re not acting as we should and must ' ' .	121.935074
he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can ' t buy yourself out and that ' s what we ' re trying to do ' ' .	31.629396
while he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro , `` for unless we do we ' re liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere .	104.21774
its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i don ' t believe we can permit that ' ' .	24.574242
-- stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of monday ' s losses in the associated press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks .	102.57774

it was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages .	179.55792

a $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here tuesday by peter g . peterson , head of one of the world ' s greatest camera firms , in a key address before the american marketing assn . .	58.26897
however , peterson , president of bell & howell , warned 800 u . s . marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom ' ' .	55.57519
`` as we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed ' ' , peterson said .	85.64073
`` with this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically ' ' .	105.375015
the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs .	92.63707
peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas .	213.38187
he cited , as an example , how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology .	108.768456
he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market .	83.537636

-- new york central railroad president alfred e . perlman said tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the chesapeake & ohio and baltimore & ohio railroads merge .	59.645428
perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect .	75.69998
the railroad president made the statement in an interview as the interstate commerce commission opened round 2 of its hearing into the c & o ' s request to control and then merge with the b & aj .	79.72259

this was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the national housing center .	125.953186
other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify ' ' .	251.52084
the poll was taken at the center ' s annual builders ' intentions conference .	64.528694
expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 .	82.99867
look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960 ' s 1 , 257 , 700 non-farm housing starts .	29.272665
the industry has said 1960 was a poor year .	35.360897
why the discrepancy between the builders ' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ?	52.215427
the reason , says the housing center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders ' ' .	100.14693
-- farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales `` we ' ve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for 10 more .	100.66703
we sold only four pickers all last year ' ' .	3.6084776
gus ehlers , competitor of mr . houtz in this farm community , says his business since august 1 is running 50% above a year earlier .	143.65681
`` before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% ' ' , he says .	53.830902
though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas .	128.13985
paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output .	146.06924
although the administration ' s program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines .	110.48279
fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently .	180.49387
the higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery .	58.89572
seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year .	177.09229
`` in august our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were 14% higher than last year ' ' , says mark v . keeler , farm equipment vice president of international harvester co . .	51.440983
for the year to date , sales of the company ' s farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 .	54.766407
among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% .	81.67572
not all sections are showing an upswing , however	27.265984
the drought-seared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend .	28.625109
the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry .	66.327896
the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally .	62.155903
farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products .	64.104546
more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation ' s trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products .	76.636955
farmers are so eager for new machinery that they ' re haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report .	120.45899
`` farmers aren ' t as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale ' ' , says jack martin , who sells j . i . case tractors and implements in sioux city , iowa .	92.29008
`` this morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2 , 700 model .	114.54942
last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine ' ' .	58.64653
in august of 1960 , he sold seven .	334.04938
with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country ' s farm equipment manufacturers .	59.34989
for example , farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about 5% above a year earlier , mr . keeler reports .	70.256004
tractor production at massey-ferguson , ltd . , of toronto in july and august rose to 2 , 418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says john staiger , vice president .	76.329
with the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements .	354.14307
merritt d . hill , ford motor co . vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers .	186.73555
except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 .	67.82808
the rise in sales last winter was checked when the government ' s new feed grain program was adopted	95.44656
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines .	80.03511
nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects .	120.17391
total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the july 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 .	116.405815
the government also is aiding farmers ' income prospects .	10.68818
agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers $1 . 4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1 . 1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 .	135.54474
price support loans may total another $1 billion this year .	28.75375
with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers ' gross income is estimated at $39 . 5 billion , $1 . 5 billion above 1960 ' s record high .	74.61188
net income may reach $12 . 7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 .	49.403027
the government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-september for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-july .	47.025585
kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling .	35.80414
the supreme court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined .	136.07803
the company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products .	107.56992
such `` depletion allowances ' ' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets .	164.43349
the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products .	95.55403
a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the ruling ' s impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products .	219.5363
the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone .	78.813515
president kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception .	186.25702
`` my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries ' ' , the president said .	41.3308
charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the i . r . s . .	36.373016
the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution .	93.059395
requests for substantiation , the service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show .	242.7407
in such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received .	55.1635
a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested .	50.73051
a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax , under federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation .	63.240837
louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale .	29.623293
the corporation , in filing its final federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under u . s . tax law .	63.173233
the revenue service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income .	147.08684
it said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations .	103.94786
the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a year-old i . r . s . ruling on the subject .	51.682163
the service has not said what its next step will be .	34.72371
peace corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency .	77.177864
it provides that the $1 , 800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received .	101.2223
the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back ' ' to the company ' s advertising manager , the tax court ruled .	70.53861
the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager .	71.40152
the court upheld the taxpayer ' s contention that these `` kickbacks ' ' were not his income though they passed through his hands .	59.30938
the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting `` it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction ' ' .	67.08812
a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel .	62.635902
the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal manufacturers ' excise tax on household-type appliances .	88.80128
hiring the wife for one ' s company may win her tax-aided retirement income .	129.84056
a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company ' s pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage .	42.130604
she would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company ' s contributions would be tax-free .	34.15474
a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income .	108.50618
in that event , they note , the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law .	111.39679
possible upshots the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made .	85.59288
state briefs voters in four counties containing and bordering denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area .	223.4611
denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax .	46.62731
the washington state supreme court ruled that the state ' s occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent .	92.2646
the state ' s occupation tax is computed on gross sales .	63.49462
the court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities .	501.52682
-- consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months , the government reported .	111.53195
the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in april , down 1% from the march level of more than $18 . 2 billion .	67.3639
april sales also were 5% below those of april last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18 . 9 billion ( see chart on page one ) .	99.810684
the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-easter buying was pushed into march .	85.55497
commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march .	137.0628
adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2 . 5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the january low of $17 . 8 billion .	80.50202

bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 f . until lightly brown .	209.36607

contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability .	189.04729
that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month .	138.18352
though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the ' 20 ' s and ' 40 ' s , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary .	95.77874
these two , heritage and drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone .	123.415245
the heritage collection , to be shown by sanger-harris and anderson ' s studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time .	104.14452
called perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces .	116.89045
walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors .	41.10997
it is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality .	105.990715
the drexel collection , called composite , to be shown by titche ' s offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs .	86.06936
rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia .	31.793774
a high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest .	75.34584
an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard .	61.530384
the other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror .	59.774574
colorful , bright eastman chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite .	31.773237
the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles .	18.810883
design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexel ' s fall 1961 group , composite .	180.94455
the spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top .	54.593487
see-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor .	69.22641
to bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics .	44.75084
dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today ' s design , with substance and maturity , keynote the perennian collection from heritage .	104.46218
center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases .	40.064964
mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile .	100.96335
the vagabonds are `` on the road ' ' again .	27.394703
members are on their way to saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars .	148.70389

in the past , the men and women have chartered planes to las vegas and jamaica , buses to mineral wells and kerrville and private railway coaches to shreveport and galveston .	46.51553
two of these are in or near dallas and the others away from the vicinity .	53.978054

guests from across u . s . honor dr . swim	122.623856
when dr . w . a . swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the wilshire country club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country .	41.409775
a flight originating in florida picked up guests on the east coast and midwest and a plane left from seattle taking on passengers at west coast points .	191.87434
cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known dr . swim when he practiced in los angeles .	65.32247
he started practice in 1917 , and served on the state board of medical examiners .	38.19751
giving up the violin opened a whole new career for ilona schmidl-seeberg , a tiny hungarian who fritz kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage .	43.06428
a heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing .	184.49577
she put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in budapest .	166.2456
now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in los angeles .	80.247925
her days as an art student at the university of budapest came to a sudden end during the hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband stephen fled to vienna .	88.445335
there they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture .	104.0522
and there she had her first showing of tapestry work .	121.544334
there ' s a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today .	34.682457
what most people don ' t seem to realize , if they aren ' t tied up with the thing as i am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation .	52.243423
i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school .	225.67996
it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school .	96.36379
getting to and from school was no problem .	7.451099
now they go to a high school that is two miles away .	43.27089
one might think the problem would be similar .	2.465478
they could walk , ride on a bus or be driven .	69.56907
it ' s much more complex than that .	107.811844
generally , they go to school with a girl named gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car .	57.4278
this is a way of getting to school , but , i understand , it entails a certain loss of social status .	56.37164
a young man doesn ' t like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn ' t even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl .	46.346684
`` why don ' t you walk to school then ' ' ? ?	29.4339
`` my father walked , through two miles of snow , in illinois ' ' .	30.267006
`` no ' ' , i said , `` i didn ' t happen to grow up in illinois ' ' .	14.499103
i explained , however , that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom .	140.81418
i had to ride a streetcar two miles .	13.681102
sometimes there weren ' t even any seats .	3.3233325
i had to stand up , with the ladies .	151.62726
sometimes i got on the wrong car and didn ' t get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there .	73.18554
i ' ve tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then .	74.74406
when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car .	47.35183
she has to have at least one car herself .	513.73267
i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman .	50.792366
if they have to take any car , they ' d rather take the big one .	70.56546
they say that when they take a car , gloriana doesn ' t take her car , but rides with them .	49.84027
but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn ' t big enough .	67.64961
the logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself .	71.60261
the solution , naturally , is the bus .	27.289944
however , it ' s a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it ' s too hard on my legs .	42.047035
my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there .	121.81919
nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman , and he ' s already got an education .	73.30855
advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the new york social register which made news last week .	156.91939
published annually by william hord richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled society register of southern california , is scheduled to arrive with monday morning ' s postman .	106.03202
publisher richardson has updated the blue book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages ' ' .	123.161804
stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year .	12.911447
last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of meredith jane cooper , daughter of the grant b . coopers , to robert knox worrell , and of mary alice ghormley to willard pen tudor .	57.587288
others are carla ruth craig to dan mcfarland chandler jr .	266.21173
joanne curry , daughter of the ellsworth currys , to james hartley gregg , and valerie smith to james mcalister duque .	38.435036
also noted are the marriages of elizabeth browning , daughter of the george l . brownings , to austin c . smith jr .	43.028873
cynthia flower , daughter of the ludlow flowers jr . , to todd huntington , son of the david huntingtons .	16.332148
listed as newly wed in the pasadena section of the new book are mr . and mrs . samuel moody haskins 3 .	29.555428
she is the former judy chapman , daughter of john s . chapman of this city .	20.069994
another marriage of note is that of jane mcalester and william louis pfau .	14.483731
for instance , the edwin pauleys jr . , formerly of chantilly rd . , are now at home on north arden dr . in beverly hills .	31.371265
mr . and mrs . robert moulton now live on wilshire and the franklin moultons on s . windsor blvd . .	37.774754
the richard beesemyers , formerly of connecticut , have returned to southern california and are now residing on south arden blvd . .	51.306313
but the raoul esnards have exchanged their residence in southern california for mexico city .	47.051895
judge and mrs . julian hazard are now at laguna beach , while the frank wangemans have moved from beverly hills to new york , where he is general manager of the waldorf-astoria hotel .	32.423847
and lawrence chase , son of the ransom chases , is listed at his new address in oxford , eng . .	40.546448
others listed at new addresses are the richard t . olerichs , the joseph aderholds jr . , the henri de la chapelles , the john berteros and dr . and mrs . egerton crispin , the john armisteads , the allen chases , the howard lockies , the thomas lockies , and anthony longinotti .	22.071426
newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the ray carbones , formerly of panama	26.411472
the geddes macgregors , formerly of scotland , and mr . and mrs . werner h . althaus , formerly of switzerland .	16.838087
here ' s an idea for a child ' s room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases .	73.09009
most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes .	84.66563
displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent .	150.94734
to create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop .	157.5205
measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet ' s head .	30.557226
make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` l ' ' , the foot of the `` l ' ' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light .	39.87242
using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base .	43.724293
in this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal .	66.42329
if the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child ' s whims .	42.762547
although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child ' s playtime .	50.974716
those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round .	20.425941
today ' s trend toward furniture designs from america ' s past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era .	58.826954
a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions .	58.528778
in the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch .	70.882195
so junior ' s bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks ' ' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only .	82.95487
this isn ' t true of the many homemakers of the 1960 ' s , according to decorator consultant , leland alden .	37.366985
housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says mr . alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical ' ' .	92.00504
there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop `` down to earth ' ' designs -- or go out of business .	102.681046
hotel escape ' s bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` kings 4 , plus two ' ' .	79.79747
this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch .	93.66841
show spotlights the kings -- george worth , bill kay , frank ciciulla and gene wilson , flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens .	39.543186
the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid .	71.08812
in the comedy division , the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props .	114.00511
net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick .	45.618015
kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs .	123.25786
if they can ' t chalk up big business here then let ' s stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing ,	193.63695

newcomers are ernie kemm on piano , wes robbins , bass and trumpet , and jack kelly on drums .	37.07065
it ' s a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by ernie , it ' s al ' s all the way .	48.54862
maestro ' s biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience .	52.817528
he skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act .	117.711876

is there anything a frustrated individual can do about communism ' s growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ?	38.146805
more than 300 teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from 4 to 8 p . m . sunday at first presbyterian church .	48.37564
at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged .	72.01271
a young real estate salesman , kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force .	169.99149
he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing .	34.172764
kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it .	72.423454
when he attended the christian anti-communist crusade school here about six months ago , jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it .	83.56887
the best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church .	101.88305
and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a biblically strong christianity .	143.96013
so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program .	125.95163

until that first dedication service , he and lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home .	116.982285
they have five daughters -- coral lee , 5 , glenda rae , 4 , pamela , 3 , karen , 2 , and shari , five months .	20.640095
but after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and bible stories .	158.03569
to their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part .	155.45433
even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her .	75.57844

enrique jorda , conductor and musical director of the san francisco symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in europe before returning home to open the symphony ' s golden anniversary season , it was announced .	51.308758
the guest assignments are scheduled for november 14 and 18 , with the orchestra sinfonica siciliana in palermo and the orchestra of radio cologne .	16.45906
the season in san francisco will open with a special gala concert on november 22 .	39.94263
during his five-month visit abroad , jorda recently conducted the orchestre philharmonique de bordeau in france , and the santa cecilia orchestra in rome .	19.860254
in announcing jorda ' s return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the sherman clay box office on wednesday .	60.64815
guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists yehudi menuhin , isaac stern , ruggiero ricci and david abel	34.00369
pianists leon fleisher , ruth slenczynka and stephen bishop and conductor earl bernard murray .	55.02264
the leningrad kirov ballet , which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house , is , i think , the finest `` classical ' ' ballet company i have ever seen , and the production of the petipa-tschaikowsky `` sleeping beauty ' ' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing .	79.97662
i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect	62.879044
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was	106.75607
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people	36.97311
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms .	36.32888
all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirov ' s utterly captivating presentation .	31.550106
the reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova ' ' , `` eva ' ' , or `` aya ' ' .	12.532623
in other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet .	318.81097
it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- miss omsk , miss pinsk , miss stalingr oops , skip it .	44.110973
these qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company ' s collective personality .	160.96136
it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet .	137.89001
oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the kirov .	63.81098
this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics .	158.68918
but , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned .	91.52373
irina kolpakova , the princess aurora of friday ' s performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before .	59.321316
she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable .	62.87517
alla sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the east , was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner , yuri soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky .	50.386475
vladilen semenov , a fine `` danseur noble ' '	1.534931
and inna zubkovskaya , an excellent lilac fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent .	50.96289
the production , designed by simon virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way .	233.19016
it was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery .	77.83817
evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , guy lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity .	99.3663
mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the san francisco chamber music society .	60.25242

sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season	83.43513
participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in the chronicle ) .	189.15613
mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 chestnut street , san francisco 9 .	65.51622
san francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children .	214.5912
fire fighters local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for san franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen .	68.3028
toys will not be collected at firehouses this year .	2.449499
they will be accepted at all branches of the bay view federal savings and loan association , at a collection center in the center of the stonestown mall , and at the junior museum , 16th street and roosevelt way .	60.667934
from the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution .	92.81468
any needy family living in san francisco can obtain toys by writing to christmas toys , 676 howard street , san francisco 5 , and listing the parent ' s name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 .	60.4921
requests must be mailed in by december 5 .	7.267494
famed cellist pablo casals took his instrument to the east room of the white house yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal .	42.36267
he was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for puerto rico governor luis munoz marin .	30.222588
president kennedy ' s invitation to the spanish-born master said , `` we feel your performance as one of the world ' s greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests ' ' .	39.850506
for a good many seasons i ' ve been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies .	56.0177
after all , this year ' s movies are next year ' s television shows .	52.519226
so i went to see `` la dolce vita ' ' .	1.5771369
it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality .	55.368923
all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film .	78.97935
if that ' s all the romans did , it ' s a surprise to me that rome fell .	67.99452
after television , `` la dolce vita ' ' seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night .	108.15002
i cannot imagine a single scene that isn ' t done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week .	42.601246
`` la dolce vita ' ' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western .	110.6238
week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` the adventures of ozzie and harriet ' ' .	34.691998
there is more decadence on `` 77 sunset strip ' ' .	4.916751
there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series .	136.18956
in another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns .	66.6055
with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you ' ll find on the robert herridge theater .	42.078354
most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party ' ' at a seaside villa .	33.823517
producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! !	118.33939
the dolce vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip )	58.77363
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face	187.39919
a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies .	5.0239987
put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word i can think of dull .	154.2823
apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall .	23.953388
what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! !	318.5733
as a moral shocker it is a dud .	5.30741
but this doesn ' t detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film .	161.51378
the chronicle ' s paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly	392.7612
`` this is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories ' ' .	78.747025
and when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .	37.74012
tonight atlantic monthly editor edward weeks moderates a round table of four russian writers in a discussion of soviet literature .	77.82188
among the subjects discussed will be russian restrictions on poets and writers in the ussr ( channel 9 at 9 30 ) .	45.446507

nbc plans a new series of three long programs exploring america ' s scientific plans titled `` threshold ' ' , to start in the fall .	61.968224
`` science in action ' ' , san francisco ' s venerable television program , will be seen in hong kong this fall in four languages mandarin , cantonese , chiuchow and english , according to a tip from dr . robert c . miller .	38.870773
it is very chic to drive foreign cars .	5.279658
with a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back .	60.34621
the wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive .	109.30601
but we couldn ' t really get along without it .	42.50454
`` where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha ' ' ? ?	6.8766747
the present crop of small cars is enriching american humor .	332.50674
gas station people are very debonair about small cars .	6.354188
when i drove a car with tail fins , i had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases .	180.56058
my car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth .	36.442947
when i had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me .	73.797646
check the oil and water , sir ? ?	1.1421627
the man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank .	3.6007657
`` what kind of car is it ' ' ? ?	2.1024172
`` it is a british austin , the smallest they make ' ' .	101.52916
`` what i always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ?	81.844955
crunch , that ' s all she wrote ' ' .	4.091762
`` that will be $1 . 80 ' ' , said the gas station man .	36.532845
`` the windshield looks pretty clean ' ' .	5.647882
ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! !	1.0993043
when i wheeled about , finned fore and aft , i was the darling of the doormen .	38.7462
dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely .	115.42418
with a small bomb , i tuck it between cadillacs .	205.60803
( the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself .	388.02032
high blood pressure can get the best of any of us .	74.55512
at last the white house is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master american craftsman , duncan phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u . s . presidents of the 19th century sent abroad for their furnishings .	64.426186
the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansion ' s library .	42.84616
the suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 ' s .	28.474123
the gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey , whose famous estate , `` tranquility ' ' , was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover , n . j . .	24.25443
authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago .	170.27843
this acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs .	21.07465
the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedy ' s fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home .	44.65558
it is the aid ' s intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of americana ' ' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall .	76.391335
the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture .	48.835827
the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem , mass . , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in 1792 .	62.35652
the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace .	45.614037
it will be painted to match the paneling in the room .	12.296689
the aid committee ' s chairman in charge of the redecoration , mrs . henry francis lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project .	40.322647
mrs . lenygon ' s committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york , include mrs . allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j . jussel , both wellknown manhattan decorators .	61.564053
regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e . barnes of boston .	45.80474
president kennedy couldn ' t stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people ' s concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the 85-piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard , n . c . .	43.60426
but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music .	100.02614
at 4 p . m . the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert .	69.12287
it was the first in the series of `` concerts for young people by young people ' ' to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house .	39.395176
she was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience .	108.501945
she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port , mass . , and in his welcoming remarks , the president said he was representing her .	31.696442
as he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion , the band struck up the `` star spangled banner ' ' and followed it with `` hail to the chief ' ' .	33.175304
`` i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band , and we are grateful to them ' ' , president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl .	95.53439
after paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , president kennedy said , `` as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music ' ' .	60.19378
he added `` i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field ' ' .	47.207207
displaying his knowledge of music , the new england-born president remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont , by young americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the united states .	78.51647
`` this is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as i do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the white house ' ' .	55.710644
as he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests .	71.19457
he expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde patricia holbrook , 16 , of mount rainier , had attended the joseph p . kennedy school for the handicapped in boston .	51.64741
`` the nuns there do a wonderful work ' ' , the president commented .	16.517258
patricia now attends the c . melvin sharpe health school in the district .	113.054756
each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon .	95.508026
they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff .	35.787197
many of the music-loving members of the president ' s staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience .	97.3347
and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected .	306.02087
henry hall wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the president ' s staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives , turned guest conductor for a sousa march , the `` stars and stripes forever ' ' .	62.587387
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs . kennedy ' s social secretary , letitia baldrige , told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring .	73.4923
he said he contacted a friend , henry hall wilson , on the president ' s staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series .	49.877003
a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student north carolina group to play the first concert .	83.96323
one of the most interested `` students ' ' on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house , was letitia baldrige , social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy .	71.178825
`` i was an art major in college ' ' , miss baldrige explained .	17.223015
`` i ' ve been here so many times i couldn ' t count them ' ' .	14.336236
she turned out to be a fan , too , of margaret bouton , the gallery ' s associate curator of education .	51.275555
miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at 5 p . m . .	51.85611
the brevard group of 85 arrived at the gallery at 6 p . m . , remaining for about 45 minutes .	25.702965
the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later .	101.70107
they decided that they thought rembrandt ' s self-portrait made him look `` sad ' '	150.04337
they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphael ' s `` alba madonna ' ' and `` texture ' ' in a monet painting of rheims cathedral .	18.934347
everybody had heard of van gogh , the french impressionist .	42.075535
gallery director john walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them .	57.715473
he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , richard bales .	68.39814
i ' m sure you ' ve heard of him and his record , ' the confederacy ' ' ' .	78.70795
along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the gallery ' s blue-uniformed guards .	77.195015
in 45 minutes , the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late 19th century .	74.42966
a few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art ' ' .	22.04974
among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were boucher , courbet , fra angelico .	29.21378
the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallery ' s rotunda fountain `` because it ' s on the second floor ' ' .	39.53412
that imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st . nw . took on bustling life yesterday .	55.479927
more than 250 scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , albert pike , who headed the scottish rite from 1859 to 1891 .	42.275337
they came together in the huge , high-ceilinged council chamber to hear the late leader eulogized .	273.6823
c . wheeler barnes of denver , head of the scottish rite in colorado , praised pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order .	55.0779
the ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of pike in the house of the temple .	27.489332
about 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the ancient and accepted scottish rite for the southern jurisdiction of the united states .	31.813162
the opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a . m . today .	20.999516

a wreath will be placed at the tomb of george washington , one of this nation ' s first masons -- a past master of washington-alexandria lodge 22 in alexandria .	54.697716
the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years .	184.05836
john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous .	33.14783
he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife .	82.00872
hurt by his lack of interest and attention , mary complained often that he didn ' t help around the house , and that he didn ' t really care about the family .	46.27722
he in turn told her she demanded too much .	6.9784203
they were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable .	2.2384653
without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done .	54.752464
the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer .	159.80374
family service , sharing in ugf , has five agencies in the washington area .	147.60669
they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems .	148.53699
because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , mr . and mrs . black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia , the agency nearest them .	73.53528
for nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce .	71.36683
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other .	61.246098
they are now working together toward solving their difficulties .	34.443546

one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev .	74.961426
`` i ' m hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground ' ' .	172.59776
the president knew that a confrontation with mr . khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable .	96.23196
but he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting .	103.290474
he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u . s . and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy .	39.02488
president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s . khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4 .	78.06644
the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relations .	23.401432
the heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the president ' s change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader .	25.79561
he was not going to vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned .	65.43136
but mr . kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr . khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe .	33.89094
that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting .	43.70756
despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war .	34.758396
the u . s . and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations ' ' .	83.900826
the first time was in 1955 when a full-dress big four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of geneva ' ' .	38.591732
the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east .	114.547295
in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u . s . .	17.722137
that meeting produced the `` spirit of camp david ' ' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement .	108.22333
on the third occasion -- another big four summit session at paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit ' ' .	52.73886
premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u . s . for the u-2 incident .	14.856107
the episode tended to confirm the u . s . belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the soviet leader ' s real aims in summitry .	61.749565
thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president , mr . kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem .	36.367607
shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words	68.096794
`` as long as mr . khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations ' ' .	139.35832
the president had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the u . s . and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance .	94.66293
he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary .	226.89018
he wanted time , too , to review the united states ' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating .	99.311356
above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev ' s doorstep .	79.49198
at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader .	96.23916
ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels .	161.24883
but mr . kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it .	110.97657
it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe mr . khrushchev ' s intentions and to make clear his own views .	34.91564
moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u . s . was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions .	81.66013
both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e . thompson brought back to russia late in february .	118.74196
the letter , dated feb . 22 , was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk , siberia , on march 9 .	26.92006
it dealt mainly with a broad range of east-west issues .	32.61502
but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr . khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted .	49.91321
developments over the next two months , however , caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing .	50.411808
there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly .	58.958885
the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva .	12.49481
the deadlock has been caused by the russians ' new demand for a three-man ( east , west and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery .	125.87795
in the u . s . , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing .	86.757645
mr . kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament .	87.652916
there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to communist china .	46.16879
the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent .	78.02683
moreover , moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the u . n . secretariat and the international control commission for laos .	35.343468
mr . kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible .	171.10596
developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting .	35.252064
initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting .	51.01071
at the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the west ' s ability and determination to resist communist pressure .	46.477886
in cuba , the u . s . had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep .	105.85556
in laos , the picture was almost equally bad .	42.021126
u . s . willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized ' ' on soviet terms .	39.157803
beyond that , allied disagreement about military intervention in laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces .	106.71739
as a result , the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos , and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure .	57.884174
in the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself .	31.816635
ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leader ' s mood was cocky and aggressive .	25.961588
he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out .	108.36084
the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin , iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back .	73.71957
it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the u . s . embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future .	50.05129
mr . kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies .	116.27455
the response from london , paris and bonn was favorable .	135.65907
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week .	49.318672
apparently at the insistence of the u . s . , the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the `` informal ' ' nature of the meeting .	43.42544
`` the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries .	71.81293
the meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries ' ' .	59.958363
the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in mr . kennedy ' s own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident ' ' , and a 44-year-old president ( his birthday is may 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy .	63.892002
the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u . s . of both approval and disapproval .	63.654896
the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at vienna .	102.01119
the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations .	17.352514
but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary .	113.85967
mr . khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men .	63.86541
the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr . kennedy would give him pause .	76.07603
apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the u . s . appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit .	46.53926
premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway .	210.86804
this time the initiative came , in part at least , from washington .	77.70407
there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr . khrushchev , the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders .	57.822548
thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity .	135.199
finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president ' s making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord .	47.121117
there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world .	35.717197
if tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the u . s . make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union .	54.77782
disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .	39.488544
after cuba and laos , it was argued , mr . khrushchev will interpret the president ' s consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds .	89.63421
moreover , the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of america ' s firm foreign policy commitments .	76.26933
the question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the president would take if mr . khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east .	61.56558
there are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory .	112.47668
the shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development .	70.59467
though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education .	79.37532
there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities .	71.923996
the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .	248.29
by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence .	105.69859
there is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture .	48.794674
viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university .	76.41319
but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project	210.37852
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy .	26.663671
official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds .	160.44917
american catholics have responded generously to bishops ' and pastors ' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning .	82.30853
they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made .	75.3305
diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility .	114.10371
all of this may be understandable enough it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise .	63.483448
yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities .	82.15482
community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible .	85.325806
to understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of american catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community .	47.81797
it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment .	59.398247
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere .	122.84924
the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension .	77.670135
the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship .	43.52484
american catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise ' ' -- the `` private enterprise ' ' of religious communities .	18.126537
had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees .	121.46369
there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business ' ' .	55.004356
this `` family-community ' ' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement .	79.68849
it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas .	60.022354
i think for example of three women ' s colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university , which is also co-educational .	36.788788
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough .	429.27942
it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot .	261.55417
apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business ' ' spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny .	46.49246
for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today ' s need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence ' ' .	72.319695
at the earlier `` pre-academic excellence ' ' stage of catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis .	69.27039
but with today ' s demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders ' ' becomes more pressing .	46.62093
the problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers ' ' are needed but that a different brand is called for .	72.69087
commenting on the earlier stage , the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee ' ' ( as opposed to , e . g . , `` maintenance employee ' ' ) was a not inapt description .	35.038994
today however , the `` outsider ' ' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university .	66.34678
and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement .	106.5054
in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it `` even with the best of intentions he ( the president of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities .	82.12682
it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' ' ' .	104.390976
the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns ' ' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside ' ' faculty .	57.129383
it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university ' ' this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension .	67.457825
but in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one .	57.857548
`` outside ' ' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business .	71.79735
there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university .	55.873188
in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel .	40.90376
word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences .	208.6108
expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype .	89.61716
in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere .	123.37294
to appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service .	90.88768
much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure .	301.48254
this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated .	36.173676
when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services .	74.549644
a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family ' ' .	45.213154
just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions .	82.94455
yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place .	118.88955
broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university .	64.80405
religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman ' s reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification .	87.97441
there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels .	75.83702
the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution .	79.93933
but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation .	144.38745
the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group ' ' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself .	42.021175
this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure .	174.08032
yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order .	57.94388
the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority .	138.07957
in the case of academic personnel the `` feeling ' ' of participation can hardly be `` faked ' ' .	20.983051
competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students ' illusion that they are making their own decisions .	83.16986
those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work ' ' and ersatz decision making .	119.71019
in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all .	251.45836
in the notre dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication ' ' .	26.223263
in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation ' ' the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i . e . , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements .	52.310528
sen . john l . mcclellan of arkansas and rep . david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws .	70.9926
once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally .	147.08522
or , in the words of anatole france , `` the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges ' ' .	62.18113
the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr . mcclellan ' s hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites .	69.05731
the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .	136.90903
in addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill .	105.680855
it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike .	75.074425
business week ( aug . 9 , 1961 ) reports that the united aircraft company , against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .	86.74668
the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers .	86.18637
the company has billed the united states government for $7 , 500 , 000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor ' s business .	53.332226
rep . frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee .	48.72389
neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter	107.72808
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions .	15.994191
the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained .	89.68218
the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines	248.89346
it must play a game in which there never is a winner .	141.06538
the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law .	112.69415
hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy .	68.05336
let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which general electric , westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market .	69.172
the industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied .	115.091896
the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment .	41.156994
accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price .	108.80752
naturally , enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .	70.27607
should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry .	56.123413
uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition ' ' .	21.917303
but if they show self-restraint , they don ' t get the orders .	19.572227
under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted .	86.427284
engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants .	88.441666
the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that general electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows .	67.59235
in other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday , wednesday and friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday , thursday and saturday .	79.465225
and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday ? ?	39.3565
the question might be asked `` don ' t the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ?	86.376686
why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws ' ' ? ?	89.51897
the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold , in the folklore of capitalism , back in 1937 .	176.95505
he wrote `` ( p . 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure .	47.68741
( p . 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship .	105.38355
( p . 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control .	57.532063
in this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws .	122.44944
( pp . 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government ' ' .	55.79478
this escape from control has led to management ' s evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while .	231.56607
a plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license .	100.97741
( the penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities .	73.22921
if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest .	143.04681
a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle .	18.275375
however , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational .	78.68074
quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union .	68.08147
those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform .	74.547905
before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english .	87.93432
the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle .	75.114784
the wagner act , the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .	24.037308
the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .	103.06283
if a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud .	64.70605
the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession .	80.64364
if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them .	91.12905
human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century america .	62.733524
as early as 1776 , adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations `` we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work	102.39653
but many against combining to raise it ' ' .	1.3926017
eighteenth-century england , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies .	66.90638
in 1825 , the boston house carpenters ' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared `` it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies ' ' .	103.7298
there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly .	118.938255
the courts shared the opinion of the employers .	9.457324
in people vs . fisher , justice savage of the new york supreme court declared	20.849474
`` without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it	56.749573
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means ' ' .	63.926525
compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin , according to the daily labor report of sept . 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment ' ' .	58.865707
senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .	67.46426
his bill , allegedly aimed at hoffa , would amend the sherman , clayton and norris-laguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international .	126.893715
paradoxically , the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act .	88.324585
indeed , it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws	184.2766
for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers .	126.74967
at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates .	62.726284
the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies .	68.74214
in the famous danbury hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices , e . g . , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer .	56.441544
the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .	103.13155
in 1914 , the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity .	71.554825
labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws .	90.53814
the courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act .	78.62471
in 1922 , the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company .	33.447613
the company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union ' s activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce .	40.3195
( what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ?	99.29976
) the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce .	141.39922
at a closed-door session on capitol hill last week , secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on u . s . affairs abroad .	35.6286
afterward , tennessee ' s democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen .	72.06891
what herter presented , said gore , was `` not a very encouraging review ' ' .	28.12666
that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts .	80.3927
while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos , two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions .	104.65918
hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery , dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the u . s . with a blunt and drastic demand within 48 hours , the u . s . had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 u . s . citizens , plus 120 cuban employees ) .	46.16539
president eisenhower held an 8 30 a . m . meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately .	64.35532
`` there is a limit to what the united states in self-respect can endure ' ' , said the president .	52.43402
`` that limit has now been reached ' ' .	1.247569
through secretary herter , ike offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision .	99.82521
kennedy , through secretary-designate of state dean rusk , declined .	26.044395
he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan . 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the u . s . and latin america ( see the hemisphere ) .	59.72469
after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants , the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam .	45.861988
`` in view of the present situation in laos ' ' , said the pentagon ' s announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific ' ' .	33.41828
cutting short a holiday at hong kong , the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines .	58.63926
on the u . s . ' s island base of okinawa , task force 116 , made up of army , navy , marine and air force units , got braced to move southward on signal .	92.64396
but by week ' s end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the u . s . was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-western -- government might be best for laos .	84.9865
there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts .	125.248924
political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right .	85.956154
`` it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again ' ' , said one military man .	104.786964
but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground ? ?	59.440266
at geneva in 1954 , to get the war in indo-china settled , the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state , north viet nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos .	68.11063
the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west .	89.84551
he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj .	38.6149
`` the important thing from now on ' ' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia ' ' .	45.475872
russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana , russian intrigue in the congo , and russian arms drops in laos ( using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time .	60.526814
soviet premier khrushchev sent new year ' s hopes for peace to president-elect kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply .	66.62129
considering the state of the whole world , the cold war ' s three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous	96.30425
but , in senator gore ' s words , it was `` not a very encouraging ' ' situation that would confront john f . kennedy on inauguration day .	38.910946
as the 87th congress began its sessions last week , liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor .	73.0278
the liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost .	192.17055
this time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable .	70.47329
they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck .	40.265675
and counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will .	172.06258
there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely mississippi ' s 14-term william meyers colmer ( pronounced calmer ) .	75.459274
caucusing , the liberals decided to go after colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the house is next to godliness .	106.45757
a dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative .	84.2121
he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents .	243.12253
he is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-negro ' ' speech .	18.828226
for 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee .	44.184715
there his vote , along with those of chairman howard smith , the courtly virginia judge , and the four republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the rayburn-johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) .	159.68034
there was sufficient pretext to demand colmer ' s ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi .	40.978676
reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons .	60.29694
in 1949 the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry truman , and in 1957 , after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage .	117.113106
( in the heat of the anti-colmer drive last week , judge smith threatened reprisal against powell .	146.49767
said he `` we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here ' ' .	63.16715
) but speaker sam rayburn , after huddling in palm beach with president-elect kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective .	56.043774
in a tense , closed-door session with judge smith , rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the rules committee ( two democrats , including one southerner , and one republican ) .	75.58121
smith flatly rejected the offer , and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels .	48.744408
the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man ' ' .	69.788124
news of rayburn ' s commitment soon leaked out .	15.525841
when missouri ' s clarence cannon got the word , he turned purple .	135.51094
he shouted , and rushed off to the speaker ' s room to object `` a dangerous precedent ' ' ! !	39.70096
cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the smith-colmer forces as chairman of the appropriations committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects .	234.00764
sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally , georgia ' s carl vinson , chairman of the armed services committee .	43.290245
as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that judge smith could lose .	65.46975
his highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus .	312.7584
the liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the democratic committee on committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the house -- before they could oust colmer .	53.597126
( one big question if colmer was to be purged , what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ?	96.29374
) in all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash .	113.5921
but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war .	62.66309
if the southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party .	128.75037
with that possibility in mind , arkansas ' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees , and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise .	96.83763
`` here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone ' ' , said a house democratic leader .	68.9752
`` one wants a little more power , and the other doesn ' t want to give up any ' ' .	16.155476
the senate launched the 87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the house ' s guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guide ' s speech .	52.113285
question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ?	55.56825
a wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from minnesota ' s democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts ' republican leverett saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills .	80.38415
new mexico ' s clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate ' s notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds .	95.70885
fair dealer humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators .	31.058842
georgia ' s dick russell objected politely , and the battle was joined .	76.623795
privately , the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage .	43.675373
privately , they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson ' s three-fifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon .	122.02116
in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress , and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding .	48.310516
armed with the nixon opinion , the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week .	102.16964
hopefully , the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all .	140.30379
since election day , vice president richard nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view .	256.96985
but with the convening of the new congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the senate until john kennedy ' s inauguration .	69.41078
one day last week , nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration ' ' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election .	59.92466
nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration ' ' .	55.615513
`` this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated ' ' , he said .	29.899698
the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves .	71.143906
gary player , the small , trim south african , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap .	114.034904
arnold palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief .	66.097984
`` just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you ' ' , player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament .	83.07731
and that is just what happened on the last few holes .	113.00879
the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer .	195.4684
player was the first to feel its teeth .	4.880343
after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( sunday ' s fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , player ' s game rapidly fell to pieces .	75.247894
after a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th .	45.57775
he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .	46.99996
as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , player was almost in tears .	64.196625
he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke .	93.58248
palmer had started the round four strokes behind player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes .	61.421074
now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf .	148.91519
when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won .	27.875244
but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression .	21.293352
in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower .	103.46981
afterwards , palmer told charlie coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast .	99.8086
he did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out , giving palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost .	63.064762
when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet .	45.63365
palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts ' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt .	91.59375
palmer ' s 281 for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe .	92.36122
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 .	43.568
until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place .	142.10143
as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69 .	87.89181
his three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by bill collins , the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long .	108.7794
but palmer knew , as did everybody else at augusta , that his streak was about to be broken .	69.12853
half an hour after he finished his round , player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of palmer .	30.179615
long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player .	82.32486
unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case .	49.37829
when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmer ' s towering prestige .	124.14588
as if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments .	115.64095
but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago , player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere .	67.30749
on the final round at pensacola , the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come .	53.341053
on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it .	126.00514
but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour .	74.296936
player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer .	43.57592
he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer ' s 71 .	67.19983
thereafter , until the masters , player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami .	248.11035
when they reached augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date .	50.54378
on thursday , the first day of the masters , the contest between palmer and player developed instantly .	114.64582
it was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course .	118.483315
the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences .	99.933365
palmer ' s 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with bob rosburg .	65.90089
but player was only one stroke back , with a 69 .	34.86228
even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between palmer and player .	91.36139
a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70	66.60287
or ken venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better	96.68099
or rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augusta ' s treacheries	64.42723
or even old byron nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf .	178.72115
( on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe .	38.27945
on friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus .	204.00758
rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time palmer and player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day .	53.838078
as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .	82.046585
player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th .	50.346394
on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament .	27.958319
he birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 .	21.530827
starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle , palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 .	35.104527
the roar of palmer ' s gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of player ' s gallery for a similar triumph .	85.315636
at one point late in the day , when palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole .	59.48958
without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply .	79.81235
anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course .	100.981834
it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence .	87.844
the bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions .	38.529655
and last week at the masters palmer and player did .	65.94464
as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was player ' s superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead .	53.757256
as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day .	66.9455
in fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes .	66.89196
but player ' s real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards .	24.791466
he hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways .	99.4292
having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out .	94.076645
player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling .	59.913372
the latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green .	35.1486
`` i was hitting the ball well ' ' , player said later , `` and i felt strong .	26.75541
when you ' re playing like that you ' d better attack ' ' .	36.95404
player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget .	125.29528
it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge .	78.53351
from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 .	110.6981
palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles .	76.62848
they started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 .	18.514065
on this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days .	53.926716
at the 4th tee palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .	43.167355
his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par .	115.69809
starting the second nine , palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it .	52.957367
when mickey charles mantle , the new york yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime .	119.95326
when roger eugene maris , mantle ' s muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe .	74.709145
but when tiny , 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there ' ' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous .	77.11191
this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .	53.687195
it is the year when ( 1 ) amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs	61.2969
( 2 ) willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammate ' s bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game	39.254913
( 3 ) the milwaukee braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them	32.220123
and ( 4 ) catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter .	31.846354
pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal .	50.480373
experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion .	68.906136
whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division .	193.86874
of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy .	114.1614
this , of course , is baseball ' s most remarkable mark the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , george herman ( babe ) ruth of the yankees .	46.224354
since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruth ' s record and each , in turn , has been thwarted .	86.6859
what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth ' s amazing september surge .	159.33899
in the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched .	102.24802
always , in the abortive attacks upon ruth ' s record , one man alone -- a jimmy foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a hank greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a hack wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid .	46.784454
but now , for the first time since lou gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 .	107.94327
their names are mantle and maris , their team is the yankees , and their threat is real .	91.12684
after 108 games in 1927 , ruth had 35 home runs .	35.806168
after 108 games in 1961 , mickey mantle has 43 , roger maris 41 .	70.373856
extend mantle ' s and maris ' s present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs .	89.56162
this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them .	77.873474
to better ruth ' s mark , neither needs a spectacular september flourish .	153.43324
all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september , and he will establish a new record .	62.74214
in ruth ' s day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games .	67.07207
baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruth ' s record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games .	113.8207
`` even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation ' ' , insists hank greenberg , now vice-president of the chicago white sox .	32.456184
`` it has to be easier with two of them .	10.477616
how can you walk maris to get to mantle ' ' ? ?	11.905923
neither mantle nor maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself .	88.38985
although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player ' s standard quote `` the important thing is to win the pennant ' ' .	78.60964
but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle , the american league ' s most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 , and maris , the mvp in 1960 .	54.28153
each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` i hope roger hits 80 ' ' , mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and i hope i hit 81 ' ' ) .	95.99684
the sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( mantle ' s in dallas , maris ' s in kansas city ) , they are rooming together .	46.586754
mantle , maris , and bob cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in jamaica , long island , not far from new york international airport .	83.708015
the three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture .	70.38916
mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom	25.950422
maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room .	12.7444315
they divide up the household chores cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible ) , and maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium .	57.77065
mantle , maris , and cerv probably share one major-league record already among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for cerv , four for mantle , and three for maris .	110.84879
as roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , mantle , 29 , who broke in with the yankees ten years ago , and maris , 26 , who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds .	57.92062
both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( mantle in commerce , okla . , maris in fargo , n . d . )	29.541521
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma ( `` sometimes in the minors ' ' , maris recalls , `` i wished i had gone to oklahoma ' ' ) .	31.850426
to an extent , the two even look alike .	66.57099
both have blue eyes and short blond hair .	3.3481066
both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger .	74.975044
with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order .	206.55148
maris purchases $100 suits from simpson ' s in new york .	30.72142
mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and pays as much as $250 each .	173.73915
neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , henry miller ' s `` tropic of cancer ' ' .	39.48425
mantle so appreciated miller ' s delicate literary style that he broadened teammates ' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips .	171.20422
mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .	92.87392
`` what do you and mickey talk about at home ' ' ? ?	12.444845
`` to tell you the truth ' ' , maris said , `` mickey don ' t talk much ' ' .	20.4129
this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer .	8.4790325
what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative .	66.270195
of the two , mantle is by nature the less outgoing , maris the more outspoken .	185.4258
but last week , when a reporter was standing near mantle ' s locker , mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote .	124.81876
he said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy .	12.210806
`` that ' s ( yogi ) berra ' s .	7.4553213
i ' ll never forget one time i struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game .	116.29264
i came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says ' you stunk ' ' ' .	64.295456
maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen .	81.428856
`` when i ' ve made a dumb play ' ' , he says , `` i don ' t want to talk to anyone .	10.9232235
by his own confession , maris is an angry young man .	26.857037
benched at tulsa in 1955 , he told manager dutch meyer `` i can ' t play for you .	49.47241
send me where i can play ' ' .	2.8888476
( meyer sent him to reading , pa . .	6.863574
) benched at indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager kerby farrell `` i ' m not learning anything on the bench .	128.2379
( farrell did -- and maris led the team to victory in the little world series .	92.269005
) `` that ' s the way i am ' ' , he says .	5.321023
if you ' re a good ballplayer , you ' ve got to get mad .	18.064308
give me a team of nine angry men and i ' ll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we ' ll beat you nine out of ten times ' ' .	43.55145
one good indication of the two men ' s personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes .	97.609245
`` when i was a kid ' ' , maris told a sportswriter last week , `` i used to follow williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not ' ' .	54.73714
`` when you came up to the majors , did you seek out williams for advice ' ' ? ?	117.24978
`` you ' re afraid to talk to a guy you idolize ' ' .	14.345368
`` when mickey went to the yankees ' ' , says mark freeman , an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver , `` dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his .	136.17119
he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him ' ' .	41.241547
among all the yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies .	139.47578
neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else .	298.92505
if laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the yankees , maris would lay ties on a railroad track .	109.448814
if working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the yankees , mantle would work in a zinc mine .	143.31068
but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , mantle and maris concentrate on baseball .	135.18953
they try to play baseball the best they can .	23.656322
mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well .	190.99985
( `` one of the reasons they get along fine ' ' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize mantle is head-and-shoulders above maris ' ' .	81.82092
) hitting , mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , maris only left-handed .	55.91362
they both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings .	124.58276
both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues	95.16285
mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base .	199.7561
both have brilliant speed mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3 . 1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer	63.03836
maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the white sox .	47.302204
both are good , daring fielders mantle covers more ground	1300.1559
yet with all their skills , the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic the home run .	209.09439
with this ultimate weapon , the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season .	67.24041
( american league expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams .	107.44157
only two teams in each league ( the yankees and detroit , the dodgers and cincinnati ) are battling for first place .	66.96776
appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball ' s lowest moment .	74.684166
in 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball .	77.33075
into washington on president-elect john f . kennedy ' s convair , the caroline , winged actor-crooner frank sinatra and his close hollywood pal , cinemactor peter lawford , jack kennedy ' s brother-in-law .	39.33886
also included in the entourage a dog in a black sweater , frankie and peter had an urgent mission to stage a mammoth inauguration eve entertainment gala in the capital ' s national guard armory .	74.40602
frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival `` it ' s really tremendous when you think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia .	101.05698
i could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans ' ' ! !	36.865852
as the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory ' s $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10 , 000 each .	51.378925
the biggest single act would doubtless be staged by frankie himself his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by hollywood couturier don loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles .	112.70549
soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered `` two of everything ' ' just `` in case he spills anything ' ' , frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of loper clothing .	87.83499
a year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps , general david m . shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless new year ' ' greeting to his pentagon staff .	78.976074
said leatherneck shoup `` a year ago i took the grips of the plow in my hands .	43.499996
after pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , i lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on .	118.64093
little geeing and hawing have been necessary ' ' .	1.3941674
but shoup also gave the corps a tilling in spots .	128.1588
speaking of `` pride ' ' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940	193.15648
the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window .	249.9261
a few of these people are still around ' ' .	7.134107
old and new briefly crossed paths in the u . s . senate , then went their respective ways .	69.48589
at a reception for new members of congress , oregon democrat maurine neuberger , taking the senate seat held by her husband richard until his death last march , got a brotherly buss from democratic elder statesman adlai stevenson , u . s . ambassador-designate to the u . n . .	41.152958
meanwhile , after 24 years in the senate , rhode island ' s durable democrat theodore francis greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last november ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the senate .	106.31102
the most famous undergraduate of south philadelphia high school is a current bobby-sox idol , dreamboat cacophonist fabian ( real name fabian forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while .	57.50919
the principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia -- fabian is a 10-o ' clock scholar in english and mathematics .	65.9231
lacking his needed credits in those subjects , fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week .	107.25247
south philadelphia high ' s principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure ' ' of a movie that the toneless lad was making .	35.099564
to decathlon man rafer johnson ( time cover , aug . 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer ' s olympic games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the a . a . u . ' s james e . sullivan memorial trophy as the outstanding u . s . amateur athlete of 1960 .	59.174404
as the world ' s top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- sports illustrated tapped golf ' s confident arnold palmer ( time cover , may 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the masters and u . s . open crowns , went on to win a record $80 , 738 for the year .	63.92183
tooling through sydney on his way to race in the new zealand grand prix , britain ' s balding ace driver stirling moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination .	50.19985
`` i ' m a slob ' ' , he announced .	16.365728
i ' m useless for anything but racing cars .	47.207554
i ' m ruddy lazy , and i ' m getting on in years .	99.5931
it gets so frustrating , but then again i don ' t know what i could do if i gave up racing ' ' .	29.161379
one of nikita khrushchev ' s most enthusiastic eulogizers , the u . s . s . r . ' s daily izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed red-prone comedian charlie chaplin at his swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 .	22.558346
chaplin , 71 , who met k . when the soviet boss visited england in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit russia some time this summer because `` i have marveled at your grandiose experiment and i believe in your future ' ' .	98.186226
then charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the nikita he had glimpsed `` i was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face ' ' .	63.67624
g . david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe ' s best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh .	54.417667
there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art .	73.06033
last week , in the german city of dusseldorf , g . david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause .	153.51697
on display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale .	108.38585
like philadelphia ' s late dr . albert c . barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( time , jan . 2 ) , thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime .	67.82678
he made his fortune during world war 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom .	80.26725
even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings .	218.37654
he gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best .	25.272587
he was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the museum of modern art ' s alfred barr said of him `` i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didn ' t know about ' ' .	46.070587
he might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting .	141.58542
he could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough .	45.940445
he bought up cezannes , braques , matisses , legers , a splendid picasso series , more than 70 giacometti sculptures .	21.104553
he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world .	28.838816
all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone ' s throw , outside pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them .	146.99512
two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city .	14.457736
but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum .	65.46703
pittsburgh turned him down , just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years .	71.67971
he went then to a 40-year-old basel art dealer named ernst beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures .	57.933933
last year beyeler arranged to sell $1 , 500 , 000 worth of klees to the state of north rhine-westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built .	39.72526
last week most of the other prizes , once offered to pittsburgh , went on the block .	83.91471
at the opening of the dusseldorf show , thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time .	71.573524
in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them .	16.336187
some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town .	130.5948
thompson himself said `` i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures ' ' .	149.16585
the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color .	33.784386
but in all its 175 years , not a single negro student has entered its classrooms .	95.25565
last week federal district judge william a . bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified ' ' negro boy and girl .	115.541794
their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in georgia -- and in alabama , mississippi and south carolina as well .	74.24841
for 18 months , hamilton holmes , 19 , and charlayne hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university .	37.687405
they graduated together from atlanta ' s turner high school , where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third .	36.39388
the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins .	75.68194
holmes went to atlanta ' s morehouse ( negro ) college , where he is a b student and star halfback .	61.629227
charlayne studied journalism at detroit ' s wayne state university .	59.11662
last fall , after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court , judge bootle ordered them to apply again .	89.84718
charlayne was `` tentatively ' ' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state .	210.41394
but holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview ' ' .	25.98165
the evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation .	195.22855
holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse ' ' .	28.067179
no , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive ' ' .	31.046892
they also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested ' ' .	12.807864
their reason holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended .	291.73798
negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes .	244.24394
the real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school .	91.225174
judge bootle ' s decision `` the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color ' ' .	158.15533

`` surprised and pleased ' ' , students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week .	75.24854
when the university of chicago ' s chancellor lawrence a . kimpton submitted his resignation last march , a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway .	94.84344
out went letters to 60 , 000 old grads , asking for suggestions .	25.63108
such academic statesmen as james b . conant were consulted .	711.99396
two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors , including adlai stevenson , richard nixon , and harvard ' s dean mcgeorge bundy .	13.998116
the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as trustee chairman glen a . lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right ' ' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago .	98.675995
last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech ' s acting dean of the faculty dynamic geneticist george wells beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( time , cover , july 14 , 1958 ) .	74.41848
it fell to chancellor kimpton , now a standard oil ( indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins .	99.70737
he threw out some of hutchins ' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2 , 100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139 . 3 million .	73.34831
but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era .	141.86981
at caltech , geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school ' s famous biology division since 1946 .	72.73726
but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making .	172.04509
beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters	216.6882
he avidly reads the wall street journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model a ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 .	210.1835
a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end .	125.8965
but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away .	171.71716
the man was king leopold 2 , of the belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good .	84.231575
by force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900 , 000 square miles of wilderness in central africa .	30.09203
this is an area nearly as large as western europe	1251.2561
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .	73.06252
its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings	26.058338
they were determined by the points at which leopold ' s explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .	93.16054
the population of the congo is 13 . 5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters ' ' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects .	92.547134
the religions of the people include christianity , mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism .	25.627113
the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate .	26.665205
the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .	154.07564
to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case	80.04992
it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done , or failed to do , in the congo since 1885 .	96.08701
at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property .	49.470875
but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience .	70.69158
the belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism .	36.718433
one definition of paternalism is `` the principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children ' ' .	59.805626
the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment .	68.49984
ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant .	125.76306
the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil .	20.598942
the colony was administered from brussels , with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote .	220.4173
the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock .	72.162575
in inside africa , john gunther describes one of these , the societe generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the house of morgan , anaconda copper , the mutual life insurance company of new york , the pennsylvania railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the united states government as a heavy partner ' ' .	75.749306
had they been truly ruthless , the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion .	75.46813
they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes	410.08527
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent	72.413345
they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food .	78.93478
but instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often .	114.01
would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ?	84.01974
the belgians also placed great emphasis on education .	3.2335978
during the 1950s there were as many as 25 , 000 schools in the congo .	50.819084
the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte ' ' and `` le chien ' ' and write his name .	31.822485
some schools were technical -- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .	79.133606
but they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .	51.807777
it was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together ' ' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .	98.66291
indeed , the belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .	83.92416
when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13 . 5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .	155.90663
why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ?	60.098362
in one large oversimplification , it might be said that the belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping africa .	132.53706
they lacked time to prepare the congo , as the british and french had prepared their colonies .	62.490913
the congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant	48.032352
and in brussels , street crowds shouted , `` pas une goutte de sang ! !	38.326397
' ' ( not one drop of blood ! !	18.428616
the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue	31.902704
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess .	71.15002
it is hard to blame them for this .	15.93078
yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless .	191.59741
as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate .	115.61581
first , there were those congolese ( among them joseph kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , balkanizing it .	53.215866
second , there were those ( moise tshombe ) who favored near-balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states .	69.845856
third , there were those ( notably patrice lumumba ) who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government .	35.01709
and fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up .	135.98184
however , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting .	143.14943
a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration .	69.828
they had divided the congo into six provinces -- leopoldville , kasai , kivu , katanga , equator and eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings .	40.10094
thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war .	101.00798
the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable western-style form of government there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces .	71.608315
well-wishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .	79.40731
if internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25 , 000-man congolese army , the force publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians .	56.79887
the president , joseph kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , patrice lumumba , a reasonable man .	114.024956
twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other .	64.21885
presently the well-armed members of the force publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting .	43.993687
terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country .	24.296452
the belgian government decided to act , and on july 10 dispatched paratroops to the congo .	54.155018
on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of katanga , moise tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country .	36.6765
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence .	3.2282646
lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians , and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them .	37.35595
on july 14 the security council -- with france and great britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the u . n . into the congo .	55.681694
vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( congolese ) government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the government , to meet fully their tasks .	51.765316
secretary-general hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the u . n . troops sent into the congo were to come from african , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the u . s . , russia , great britain or france .	41.500633
he quickly called on ghana , tunisia , morocco , guinea and mali , which dispatched troops within hours .	64.847015
ultimately the u . n . army in the congo reached a top strength of 19 , 000 , including about 5 , 000 from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden , who were the only whites .	62.004814
it took the u . n . three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo .	71.252785
the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed u . n . efforts .	59.92823
the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the u . n . to get out of the congo along with the belgians , and appealed to russia for help .	72.340004
( however , there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist .	92.005486
before appealing to the u . n . or to russia , he first appealed to the u . s . for military help , and was rejected .	43.998062
) lumumba further complicated the u . n . ' s mission by initiating small `` wars ' ' with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which , under albert kalonji , wanted to secede as well .	69.57338
meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo , sending lumumba equipment for his `` wars ' ' , dispatching `` technicians ' ' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly .	50.29803
but by the end of the three-month period , in october 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the congo .	66.72958
president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him .	7.856438
control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of joseph mobutu , chief of staff of the congolese army .	67.86806
mobutu promptly flung out the russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at u . n . headquarters in new york .	74.68488
the belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops .	50.945858
but they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers ' ' or `` mercenaries ' ' , who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga , the seceded province which , according to tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country .	35.720512
from october 1960 to february 1961 , the u . n . forces in the congo took little action .	43.56608
there was no directive for it -- the security council ' s resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or balkanize it .	53.411808
during the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo .	16.454863
in february the murder of patrice lumumba , who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe , again stirred the u . n . to action .	68.84275
on feb . 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort ' ' .	43.82234
although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one .	59.655384
it also urged that the u . n . eject , and prevent the return of , all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers	96.16173
urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army .	17.646511
though president john f . kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloy ' s unexpected report from khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of u . s . foreign policy last week .	54.661343
high up on the president ' s priority list was the thorny question of bizerte .	67.3479
on this issue , the president received a detailed report from his u . n . ambassador adlai stevenson , who had just returned from paris , and mr . kennedy asked stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both paris and tunis -- out of the imbroglio .	48.723995
ideally , the president would like the french to agree on a `` status quo ante ' ' on bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base .	54.591484
to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , mr . kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend .	75.549324
the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no . 2 man in the tunisian government , defense minister bahi ladgham , who flew to washington last week to seek u . s . support .	47.38042
the conversation apparently convinced mr . kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable .	73.50495
through ladgham , mr . kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba	75.10389
and one u . s . official said `` the key question now is which side picks up the phone first ' ' .	187.41037
on the latin american front , the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the inter-american economic and social council ( which the president himself had originally hoped to attend ) .	60.74349
main purpose of the meeting to discuss president kennedy ' s alliance for progress .	17.443466
in conferences with nationalist china ' s dapper , diminutive vice president chen cheng , mr . kennedy assured chiang kai-shek ' s emissary that the u . s . is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations .	27.674288
chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia	37.438557
however the president , who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow , would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the u . s . if outer mongolia ' s admission comes to a vote .	74.48313
the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid .	96.21704
to africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , attorney general robert kennedy , on a good-will mission to the ivory coast .	43.518707
all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs	101.66263
in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared `` we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason ' ' .	87.539764
from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston , as the great four-jet boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at phoenix , el paso , and san antonio .	39.82357
when continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11 30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer .	47.977165
the plane put down on schedule at 1 35 a . m . in phoenix .	10.258897
thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for el paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard .	91.79874
at 3 57 a . m . , with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso , passenger robert berry , a san antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit .	53.5347
`` the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach ' ' , berry said .	28.425781
`` i figured he was sick ' ' .	2.3258896
john salvador , a farmer from palm desert , calif . , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit .	63.26922
`` the kid had a automatic , like they issue in the army ' ' , he said .	26.989176
`` the other fellow had a ' ' .	6.551771
salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess lois carnegey	39.51318
the man put his at the head of capt . byron d . rickards .	50.209316
to rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story his plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa .	90.98763
but last week ' s pirates , like the cuban-american who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra ( newsweek , aug . 7 ) , wanted to go to havana .	33.422695
`` tell your company there are four of us here with guns ' ' , the elder man told rickards .	64.867584
the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message .	758.09656
but , he told the `` skyjackers ' ' , the 707 didn ' t carry enough fuel to reach havana	39.925903
they would have to refuel at el paso .	3.972479
most passengers didn ' t know what had happened until they got on the ground .	33.0323
jerry mccauley of sacramento , calif . , one of some twenty air force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion .	129.72063
`` the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba ' ' , mccauley said , `` and like a nut i raised my hand .	51.636173
i thought he was the air force recruiter ' ' .	5.437583
what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew .	70.38899
they chose four jack casey , who works for continental airlines in houston	57.300907
pfc . truman cleveland of st . augustine .	11.854192
fla . , and leonard gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the u . s . immigration service border patrol .	28.06326
everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at 4 18 a . m . .	58.381603
they found a large welcoming group -- el paso policemen , border patrol , sheriff ' s deputies , and fbi men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns .	23.80856
other fbi men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana .	63.406063
the ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours .	173.92293
still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propeller-driven douglas aj .	116.257866
actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane	68.39139
they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of cuba ' s fidel castro who had taken over the 707 .	95.58662
mr . kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone .	102.88714
at one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot , the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba .	51.977486
as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment .	105.401245
from the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being cubans , were native americans , subsequently identified as leon bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge , ariz . , and his son , cody , 16 , a high-school junior .	68.38363
the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens .	22.879612
the father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business ' ' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons .	97.22971
at 7 30 a . m . , more than three hours after landing , the beardens gave an ultimatum	72.86511
the tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a . m . , and captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway .	17.879557
several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet .	50.850903
the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines	42.64547
ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it .	68.68281
at 12 50 p . m . a ramp was rolled up to the plane .	40.862694
a few minutes later , fbi agent francis crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed .	82.57286
while crosby distracted the beardens , stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door .	23.61335
so did hostages casey , cleveland , and mullen .	49.527523
that left only the four crew members , crosby , and border patrolman gilman , all unarmed , with the beardens .	54.367256
the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket .	49.749615
gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance .	77.997
he caught officer simmons ' eye , nodded toward young bearden , and -- `` i swung my right as hard as i could .	83.873985
simmons and crosby jumped the boy and it was all over ' ' .	12.634164
frog-marched off the airplane at 1 48 p . m . , the beardens were held in bail of $100 , 000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines .	52.84782
( bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to castro , and live high in cuba .	145.9138
) back home in coolidge , ariz . , his 36-year-old wife , mary , said `` i thought they were going to phoenix to look for jobs ' ' .	42.89277
taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation .	31.287695
the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in u . s . history .	65.60976
with the money all but in hand , however , the administration indicated that , instead of the 225 , 000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160 , 000 .	80.12152
the `` hold-back ' ' , as pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently .	76.16038
in all , the senate signed a check for $46 . 7 billion , which not only included the extra $3 . 5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for .	84.72597
( the senate , on its own , decided to provide additional b-52 and other long-range bombers for the strategic air command .	46.937176
) the house , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the president ' s urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order .	79.0653
in other areas , congressional action last week included	2203.424
the senate ( by voice vote ) and the house ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign , not too unhappily .	77.74851
the senate also voted $5 . 2 billion to finance the government ' s health , welfare , and labor activities .	22.012115
debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend .	76.431274
white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact .	181.52548
most members of the u . s . senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can .	122.2933
but , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter .	88.14931
as a result , ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it .	94.69707
over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-american course .	79.86439
individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from michigan , soft-shell crabs from maryland , oysters from washington , grapefruit from florida .	74.63978
but plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late sen . fred dubois of idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the senate ' s stomach was in the right place .	57.189377
in a daring stroke , the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10 , 000-per-year french-born maitre d ' hotel .	50.349514
holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .	69.29874
long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward .	136.02121
higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues .	9.996951
result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .	264.84644
things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds .	96.76608
traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .	81.38371
that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates .	71.621086
as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments .	227.9627
another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds .	59.658146
other tax-exempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21 , according to standard & poor ' s average .	127.482735
on balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then .	114.95631
however , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend .	168.7286
on these bonds , price rises since february 21 easily outnumber price declines .	161.1144
investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds .	91.80101
you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page .	95.76358
many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that .	70.29937
and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds .	153.24226
that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds .	184.90143
it ' s not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on u . s . treasury bonds .	47.39305
for investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high .	30.68101
it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16 , 000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32 , 000 of taxed income .	26.250004
a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in february or march -- shows what is happening .	107.78995
the report is based on a survey by blyth & company , investment bankers .	26.705528
nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period .	14.246904
and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession .	50.68655
many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .	45.48234
indication the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward .	167.04652
look , for example , at the ohio turnpike .	10.905616
traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february , as compared with those same months in 1960 .	45.851295
then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs .	72.61223
as a result , the road ' s net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds .	26.86317
that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months .	11.849303
that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike .	20.92616
operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in march .	38.835632
costs were held down , despite a bitter winter .	44.359585
for the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period .	24.789274
the road ' s engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston .	109.376656
some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do .	35.71101
the 187-mile illinois state toll highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until december , 1958 .	51.016613
in the 12 months ended in february , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves .	33.394466
in the 12 months ended in february , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest .	19.07309
in the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 .	87.35554
success , for many turnpikes , has come hard .	201.60083
traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers ' rosy estimates .	104.38893
in these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways .	119.95995
many rate increases already have been put into effect .	62.340942
higher tolls are planned for july 1 , 1961 , on the richmond-petersburg , va . , turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study .	44.716667
progress is being made , too , in improving motorists ' access to many turnpikes .	84.4968
net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb . 28 , 1961 .	19.16216
further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city , kans . , and kansas city , mo . .	57.18738
meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road ' s reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .	107.68761
investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals .	118.03338
traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike .	115.56665
if nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 .	67.99092
west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same .	57.249947
the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement .	67.766846
it ' s going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full .	59.436806
already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins .	162.09668
many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point .	43.4714
a top american official , after a look at europe ' s factories , thinks the u . s . is in a `` very serious situation ' ' competitively .	39.74764
commerce secretary luther hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on may 10 toured plants of two of italy ' s biggest companies -- fiat , the auto producer , and olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines .	64.3718
our staff man cabled from turin as follows --	257.46158
`` follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant , and you learn this	65.10837
`` one , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the marshall plan -- enables fiat to turn out 2 , 100 cars a day .	187.39928
`` two , wage costs are a fraction of the u . s . costs .	8.908291
a skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week .	38.242043
fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years .	12.908957
`` said secretary hodges ' it ' s a tough combination for the u . s . to face .	24.58555
`` olivetti had a special interest for hodges .	10.284775
olivetti took over underwood , the u . s . typewriter maker , in late 1959 .	35.06464
within a year , without reducing wages , underwood ' s production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed .	159.19545
the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled .	50.622387
`` the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout , modern machinery .	94.3878
the firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious .	27.02149
`` hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the u . s . .	13.443642
the inflow of foreign capital would help the u . s . balance of payments .	13.609184
`` hodges predicted ' i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the u . s . .	39.23784
there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' ' ' .	39.321606
foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports .	239.05978
the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines .	93.04608
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these	6726.193
an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy .	46.92453
chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting .	7.4056134
the u . s . will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years .	81.31184
point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet .	114.70635
if they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would .	182.26393
idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible .	13.062739
at the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries .	114.03577
japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily ' ' curbing exports of textiles to the u . s . .	15.0083475
hong kong , india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the `` lancashire pact ' ' .	55.75058
none of these countries is happy with these arrangements .	83.58147
the japanese want to increase exports to the u . s . while they have been curbing shipments , they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big u . s . market .	56.979343
hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain , while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly .	65.09694
the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons .	99.687454
the kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in asia and europe will see that `` dumping ' ' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas .	103.4083
gradual , controlled expansion of the world ' s textile trade is what president kennedy wants .	70.598206
this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products .	48.955257
it ' s an important clue to washington thinking .	70.05388
note , too , that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the u . s . textile industry .	20.73025
`` get competitive or get out ' ' .	4.3604455
in veiled terms , that ' s what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry .	34.55176
the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn ' t seem feasible .	88.65282
special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed .	91.77489
government research will look into new products and methods .	91.95071
import quotas aren ' t ruled out where the national interest is involved .	53.885735
but the kennedy administration doesn ' t favor import quotas .	14.498266
rather , they are impressed with the british government ' s success in forcing -- and helping -- the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products .	93.744514
what ' s happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries .	175.23027
among the highest-paid workers in the world are u . s . coal miners .	12.762694
yet u . s . coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers ' mouths water .	23.797249
steel company of wales , a british steelmaker , wants to bring in virginia coal , cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets .	62.89913
virginia coal , delivered by ship in wales , will be about $2 . 80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines .	50.5296
u . s . coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight .	60.487373
many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting , narrow and very deep .	97.84868
productivity of u . s . miners is twice that of the british .	172.7253
welsh coal miners , communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal .	161.12593
the british government will have to decide whether to let u . s . coal in .	61.658237
the british coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can ' t sell .	73.00078
every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` i ' m sorry , but we don ' t have that book .	60.907185
there wouldn ' t be much demand for it , i ' m afraid ' ' .	9.144746
behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest .	246.33383
what to buy out of the year ' s grist of nearly 15 , 000 book titles ? ?	98.31267
what to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ?	58.10297
a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian ' s salary , and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world ' s richest city .	48.72993
the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse .	374.90314
confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds .	80.72466
in some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis .	101.937416
new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow .	71.73514
because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the new york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works .	64.05367
at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area .	41.664356
at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve .	49.968597
both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state .	80.124725
it was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today .	88.054695
under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts .	270.6986
an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit .	123.78767
some library boards are wary of the plan .	3.6420705
a large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great .	87.084206
a small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board .	175.81723
within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved .	115.19572
the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system .	53.58469
all services are given without cost to members .	40.199703
so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op .	55.59107
to set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100 , 000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it .	92.566734
the collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection .	35.95423
each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency .	58.03828
the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars .	66.25639
in nassau county , for example , the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 .	91.12488
this system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation .	81.40304
the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area .	89.80414
the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford .	97.56764
nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100 , 000 volumes by 1965 .	43.64916
the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers .	84.461754
basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries .	69.91602
on microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals .	57.127724
the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans .	105.01841
it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide .	80.093254
the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries .	142.14189
each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon .	240.44286
east meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion	200.60986
freeport houses social science , pure science , and language	34.40503
history , biography , and education are centered in hempstead	96.763275
levittown has applied science , business , and literature	209.98083
while hewlett-woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages .	36.850136
the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service .	53.792873
this kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course .	14.561689
public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis .	112.7034
local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library .	115.28853
the system passes on these savings to its members .	43.07494
further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing .	93.65305
books are not the only resource of the system .	38.187855
schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities .	97.96861
the most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge .	95.27605
this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` nanook of the north ' ' , `` the emperor ' s nightingale ' ' , and `` the red balloon ' ' .	34.604927
workshops are conducted by the system ' s audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service .	58.95391
the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together	251.2763
consequently an experienced children ' s librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children ' s librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits .	55.38688
headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection .	77.4365
sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups .	127.39384
story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children ' s consultant .	64.77087
headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries .	158.23657
in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children ' s program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county	45.513203
it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries	49.900715
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used	677.5363
and it publishes sum and substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system ' s activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries .	40.457443
the system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership .	43.28574
in nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general .	53.915253
librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today .	140.69128
library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans , the teen-agers .	84.0447
to them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` i ' m sorry , we don ' t have that book ' ' .	29.487007
today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned .	59.41417
the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world .	61.488064
education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society .	67.24769
the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life .	44.739075
we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read	26.667023
if we do not know how to use what we do read .	56.830677
we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word .	108.18066
a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries .	111.98978
although progress has been made in america ' s system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america .	119.99571
the problem grows in intensity each year as man ' s knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand .	91.59341
the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition .	146.91777
there are , for example , approximately 25 , 000 , 000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50 , 000 , 000 with inadequate service .	40.5415
in college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1 , 509 institutions surveyed last year by the u . s . office of education .	24.755756
and over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all .	73.2582
in every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services .	85.74603
only public understanding and support can provide that service .	289.98642
this is one of the main reasons for national library week , april 16-22 , and for its theme `` for a richer , fuller life , read ' ' ! !	100.95343
the general assembly , which adjourns today , has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened .	130.82292
it was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools , an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education .	53.258656
there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight , in which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers .	41.60636
the final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need .	148.90674
long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government .	69.712456
this session , for instance , may have insured a financial crisis two years from now .	279.77362
in all the turmoil , some good legislation was passed .	79.755775
some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action .	86.256996
certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue .	100.11112
no action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales .	150.25514
only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state .	133.06595
the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions .	86.97266
fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like anything but `` the empire state of the south ' ' .	68.05664
we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation .	114.636795
in the interim between now and next year , we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgia ' s very real economic , fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics .	120.05421
the league of women voters , 40 now and admitting it proudly , is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive .	161.46935
it ' s a good use of money .	10.39896
these women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jefferson ' s dictum that one must cherish the people ' s spirit but `` keep alive their attention ' ' .	55.24395
`` if once they become inattentive to the public affairs ' ' , jefferson said , `` you and i , and congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves ' ' .	55.297028
newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs .	521.2729
the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public .	41.489414
the harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in .	62.266434
and the league takes a stand , with great regularity , on the side of right .	30.541437
cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission .	94.24646
coupling its own budget of $83 , 750 with a $30 , 000 state grant authorized by gov . vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in march with georgia tech . .	45.319897
then a full-time planning office will be established in rome to work with a five-member georgia tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program .	65.01566
it recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach .	144.83711
the rusk belief in balanced defense , replacing the dulles theory of massive retaliation , removes a grave danger that has existed .	79.11131
the danger lay not in believing that our own a-bombs would deter russia ' s use of hers	43.277245
the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough .	45.09888
by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war .	80.28631
this strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war .	9.679108
it also weakened our diplomatic stance , because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity .	112.84455
this left the soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity .	26.45654
by maintaining the nuclear deterrent , but gearing american military forces to fight conventional wars too , secretary of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position .	123.43578
dekalb ' s budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance .	133.97046
it includes a raise in the county minimum wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance .	66.5056
that such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by chairman charles o . emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials .	63.171547
g . mennen williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly .	153.4898
touring africa , the new u . s . assistant secretary of state observed `` africa should be for the africans ' ' and the british promptly denounced him .	62.92844
then he arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying `` american imperialists , go home ' ' .	117.09122
confidence in the state ' s economic future is reflected in the georgia power company ' s record construction budget for this year .	75.06143
the firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning .	276.51706
it is good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization .	49.24294
georgia ' s mental health program received a badly needed boost from the general assembly in the form of a $1 , 750 , 000 budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital .	34.194225
actually it amounts to $1 , 250 , 000 above what the institution already is receiving , considering the additional half-million dollars gov . vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus .	98.26608
either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is .	94.00862
but exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing .	140.06541
the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished .	49.31878
the work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced .	111.311356
more attendants , nurses and doctors should be hired .	87.22921
patients deserve more attention than they are getting .	7.477224
even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year , georgia will be spending only around $3 . 15 per day per patient .	67.791016
the national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low .	89.185616
kansas , regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill , spends $9 per day per patient .	62.4689
but in so many other areas we still are dragging .	126.23229
considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done , it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted .	182.79424
assassination , even of a tyrant , is repulsive to men of good conscience .	118.883484
rafael trujillo , the often blood-thirsty dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history .	100.69718
but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered .	92.79087
the responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez , a professor at columbia university in new york , has been laid at his door .	32.90614
he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela .	60.305878
it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez , has been uncovered and quashed .	48.097893
the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive .	76.59772
unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably .	194.60535
but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition .	216.98598
el benefactor ' s vanity grew with his personal wealth .	44.71988
the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure .	73.75578
he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise , and his influence extended even to congress .	108.678154
until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character .	88.32804
tardily the government here came to understand how this country ' s own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression .	63.12584
last year , after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean , the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him .	34.862453
thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines .	69.502
trujillo ' s dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines .	30.198092
but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans .	139.35466
there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba , previously a bete noire to trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces .	65.39215
what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle .	10.058459
the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed .	140.33208
perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger .	70.95662
the dominican republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom .	144.62573
such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people , who deserve to breathe without fear .	75.55386
for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help .	78.04001
high-speed buses on the george washington memorial parkway , operating between downtown washington and cabin john , glen echo and brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city .	124.90235
in presenting plans for such express buses before the montgomery county council , the administrator of the ncta , c . darwin stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching .	72.072586
such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area .	98.73351
because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed .	127.9978
the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress .	46.788383
the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city .	176.13417
so far as the record is concerned , the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so .	73.89825
though walter ulbricht , by grace of soviet tanks , may be head man in east germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone .	61.409363
the wartime protocol of september 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` greater berlin ' ' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation .	99.35768
it was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by soviet , american , british , and french troops respectively .	66.44372
after the berlin blockade and airlift , the council of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin ' ' .	77.4837
for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas .	58.681522
then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany .	49.14445
that this and the closing of the east berlin-west berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain , france , and the united states sent to moscow after the latter ' s gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german officials to west berlin .	78.612144
the chancellor had as much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard eisler .	72.63006
the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities `` to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany ' ' .	65.65664
they insisted on the `` fundamental fact ' ' that `` the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status ' ' .	29.927256
this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact .	206.3609
there remains , of course , the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts .	120.562195
one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist `` vopos ' ' try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents .	77.4966
another remained when an american army car was recovered but with a broken glass .	67.195435
the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed .	44.228962
remembering the step-by-step fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about `` salami ' ' tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy ' s representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed .	82.91845
thousands of buffalo ( `` bison ' ' they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland .	100.32201
a horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth .	53.930534
that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west made in live-oak canyons near hollywood .	79.87475
for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill .	110.476364
the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county , northeast kansas , as a `` prairie national park ' ' .	30.300003
there the buffalo would roam , to be seen as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens .	66.71164
wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved .	34.627346
grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them .	63.23128
the park service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park .	492.4612
american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to approve .	72.56827
a philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on tv and radio .	200.66725
starting with small stations not members of the national association of broadcasters , the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations .	77.34818
probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power .	154.04501
the national association of broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials .	19.316942
past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy .	71.87737
even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition .	114.72932
why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action ? ?	67.27752
simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread .	69.04025
soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors .	106.7547
although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsie-cola and gulling him into downing bourbon .	54.993446
registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect their party ' s candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization .	77.78945
in the central contest , that for mayor , they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other .	101.41168
mayor robert f . wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office .	177.7899
while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools , law enforcement and fiscal policies .	83.344986
the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record .	33.571453
state controller arthur levitt , on the other hand , cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city ' s welfare .	62.78212
they , too , have links with the city ' s ills .	23.562086
both men are known to be honest and public-spirited .	37.59848
mayor wagner ' s shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of mr . levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post .	138.87659
as mayor , mr . levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like .	82.96944
his election , on the other hand , would unquestionably strengthen the `` regulars ' ' .	61.71424
mr . wagner might or might not be a `` new ' ' mayor in this third term , now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls `` bosses ' ' .	66.517044
these are , of course , the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote .	282.86707
but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him .	58.25344
if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be made .	122.59351
the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party .	52.650917
both mr . k ' s have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos .	286.37573
president kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refused thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow .	75.88155
but at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting .	68.23506
and secretary rusk , en route to bangkok , doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai seato forces .	53.355835
for mr . kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation .	139.36716
the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs .	77.57461
he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says .	77.12063
in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr . khrushchev for the third time .	34.412914
at his press conference mr . kennedy said , `` all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn ' ' .	67.56605
at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position .	503.79614
since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington , this approach might be expected to head off mr . khrushchev for the moment .	61.879665
but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos , the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot , but would bog washington in a tactical mess .	90.620544
as wars go , laos is an extremely little one .	27.669598
casualties have been running about a dozen men a day .	100.55419
the hard core of the pro-communist rebel force numbers only some 2 , 000 tough viet minh guerrilla fighters .	68.93479
but for the united states and its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th ' -wisp terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners .	157.38654
but if anything can bring home to mr . khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this braddock-against-the-indians contest , it will probably be the fact that seato forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington .	100.35339
fortunately both the republicans and america ' s chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president .	88.582886
actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table .	66.311195
it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable .	140.08932
the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 , and last year washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma .	38.882183
but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers .	89.25011
the road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation ' s terrain .	137.56671
but for the safety of southeast asia , and for the sake of the laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made .	71.723816
the world awaits mr . khrushchev ' s choice of alternatives .	68.70648
the senate ' s overwhelming ( 64-13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower house .	179.33878
twice previously the senate has approved measures backing etv and the house has let them die .	96.200615
the house communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds .	120.399956
this year ' s senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with $1 , 000 , 000 to be used in support of private , state , or municipal etv efforts .	30.284353
the funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation .	143.84067
the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value .	54.92594
but , lacking money from commercial sponsors , the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service .	204.4537
other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment .	172.61809
sam rayburn was a good man , a good american , and , third , a good democrat .	72.725296
he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure	3075.3667
mr . speaker , mr . sam , and mr . democrat , at one and the same time .	28.143253
the house was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , speaker of the house , and second most powerful man in washington .	111.62309
mr . rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label .	150.21896
he was no flaming liberal , yet the new deal , the fair deal and the new frontier needed him .	112.28902
he was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any .	68.30805
two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word .	173.08476
sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction .	67.4827
it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs .	220.72958
the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical .	35.150562
a growl , a nod , was usually enough .	65.728745
when it was not , one of the great dramas of washington would be presented .	71.28949
he would rise in the well of the house , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence .	67.54724
he spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes .	54.002666
he made good , plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it .	144.6258
these public efforts were rare because mr . rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor .	197.97444
he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them .	66.96501
with his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader .	101.98994
he was , of course , in the house for a very long time .	22.309671
there are only two men remaining in congress who , with rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917 .	51.812805
to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr . sam coincided with that of the house .	41.747295
to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition .	52.038506
the senate to him was not the `` upper body ' ' and he corrected those who said he served `` under ' ' the president .	69.60839
sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death .	121.951126
woodrow wilson , with whom he began his years in washington , warren g . harding , calvin coolidge , fdr , with whom he managed a social revolution .	75.71536
and those still with us , herbert c . hoover , harry s . truman , dwight d . eisenhower and john f . kennedy .	18.841208
he was a fighter for those of his own party .	65.31556
mr . truman has only to recall the `` hopeless ' ' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr . kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr . sam been there .	110.34858
as it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration .	47.13098
he was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist .	66.761375
he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play .	41.36875
under any name -- mr . speaker , mr . democrat , mr . sam -- he was a good man .	20.704477
thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends .	146.34093
in 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle .	66.27181
simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river .	86.99688
the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries .	88.10947
in other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga .	110.33074
does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ? ?	203.12961
to the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence .	195.996
mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences .	103.20869
yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga .	41.640182
it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it .	145.23602
the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ?	144.80411
the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa .	141.92381
right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga .	94.904915
that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view .	9.174665
the un army is too weak , too demoralized for the task .	53.31402
further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned .	100.23144
last , it makes no sense to deliver katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos .	214.54773
the congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence .	29.425081
the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom .	229.69466
it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism .	103.50701
but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach .	110.279884
otherwise , un will march blindly on to certain defeat .	203.5171
a recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific co . and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information .	41.493008
the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours ' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year .	124.404785
our comment was that this was `` featherbedding ' ' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement .	72.96375
the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life .	64.87569
additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need .	65.46382
also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic .	157.74396
the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries .	85.04642
the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands .	51.281715
time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side .	96.66979
but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in st . louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there .	57.56535
it was , the brief writers decided , `` man ' s best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world ' ' .	39.302513
peace , it ' s wonderful , and `` world law ' ' , it ' s wonderful , too , and shouldn ' t we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? ?	55.724163
meanwhile , in moscow , khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can ' t see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism .	81.541695
a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st . louis to the moon , where there wouldn ' t even be any beer to drink .	77.61738
while he was at it , the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can ' t appreciate coexistence thru suicide .	129.80435
`` fools ' ' , he bayed , `` what do you think you are doing ' ' ? ?	16.234695
the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren ' t playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort .	68.352394
another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun .	53.874184
the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana , where , for some unknown reason , castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old ten o ' clock shadow .	61.152565
the plane was sent back to the united states , for a change , but castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution .	52.08314
less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castro ' s right hand man , che guevara , who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas , venezuela .	62.408577
the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen , who were on hand to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium .	120.16102
perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes , but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests , these things would not happen .	60.58771
the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev .	89.186554
pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it ' s getting dark down here and we ' re minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away .	98.84232
the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month .	63.376408
the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car .	100.24363
by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines .	121.19241
the board ' s action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws .	108.26726
word of dag hammarskjold ' s death in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe .	59.75121
as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously .	54.90748
it was on the eve of a momentous u . n . session to come to grips with cold war issues .	33.11155
mr . hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace .	23.041077
he had sought talks with moise tshombe , the secessionist president of congo ' s katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody .	127.45746
the story of the fatal crash is not fully known .	128.46123
the u . n . -chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired .	92.71224
whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined .	61.080467
the death of mr . hammarskjold removes the united nations ' most controversial leader .	96.766785
he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice .	40.312717
he courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc .	28.62186
the congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs .	30.954489
his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape .	77.80896
when the recent katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr . hammarskjold , despite the danger , flew to exert a calming influence .	82.49623
the u . n . session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing .	113.733406
it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments .	34.845512
if the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice .	105.240234
reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of greater miami ' s hardest tasks .	49.804455
even when public bodies arrived at a consensus , at least one dissenting vote has been usual .	56.049572
so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity .	238.4988
all nine members of the inter-american center authority voted for goodbody & company ' s proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center .	90.55826
the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract .	62.61094
if the indenture is accepted , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue .	87.535835
then goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15 . 5 million for developing the spacious graves tract to house the center .	64.96583
the next step awaits approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade county port authority .	56.91355
they allotted $500 , 000 three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arranged .	137.84138
less than half the sum has been spent , since the interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations .	144.21432
the balance is being budgeted for the coming year .	16.90068
it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed .	291.6024
the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8 . 5 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project .	52.9287
so have the people ' s elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels .	41.842056
interama , as it rises , will be a living monument to greater miami ' s ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises .	73.37255
progress , or lack of it , toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the united states commission on civil rights .	68.04408
much happened in this field during the past 12 months .	26.867699
each state advisory committee documented its own activity .	8.678561
some accounts are quite lengthy but florida ' s is the shortest of all , requiring only four paragraphs .	138.29802
`` the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas ' ' , reported this group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south floridians , william d . singer and john b . turner of miami .	75.225395
`` no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group .	74.028885
`` the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights ' ' .	58.7096
problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint .	67.68517
the progress reported by the advisory committee is real .	580.1136
while some think we move too fast and others too slowly , florida ' s record is a good one and stands out among the 50 .	158.64818
west germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on berlin and unification , with a coalition government .	71.251564
this is the key fact emerging from sunday ' s national election .	37.79858
chancellor adenauer ' s christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 .	82.83112
in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength .	70.04293
the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired .	172.63333
both willy brandt ' s social democrats , who gained 22 seats in the new parliament , and the free democrats , who picked up 23 , will insist on that before they enter the government .	87.75855
moon-faced ludwig erhart , the economic expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him .	325.00082
if he becomes chancellor , dr . erhart would make few changes .	398.99002
the wizard who fashioned west germany ' s astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise .	65.913864
he is dedicated to building the nation ' s strength and , as are all west germans , to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany .	88.79992
what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result .	81.44132
if the party of adenauer and erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of willy brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve .	50.74074
west berlin ' s mayor brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it .	60.172256
the free democrats ( 12 per cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union , and more dealings with the communist bloc .	29.558535
the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility .	106.11431
it could go either way , since the gains for both points of view were about the same .	66.08462
regardless of the decision two facts are clear .	3.6347015
west germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations .	125.22313
and the career of konrad adenauer , who upheld germany ' s tradition of rock-like leaders which bismarck began , draws near the end .	95.86295
americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing .	251.25856
but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn ' t want to make a spectacle of himself .	13.374038
for instance , so-called `` conservative ' ' organizations , some of them secret , are sprouting in the garden of joining where `` liberal ' ' organizations once took root .	78.72836
one specific example is a secret `` fraternity ' ' which will `` coordinate anti-communist efforts ' ' .	19.339634
the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled .	101.877846
according to the chicago tribune news service , state atty . gen . stanley mosk of california has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1 .	71.56011
does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ? ?	16.258408
does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ? ?	119.29751
does it put the label of un-american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically ? ?	246.11932
does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars , communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ? ?	39.197556
does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ? ?	153.11072
do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate ? ?	150.82733
in some instances a seventh question can be added 7 .	279.62598
does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system ? ?	93.56726
if the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time .	39.01485
falling somewhere in a category between einstein ' s theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless -- is the tropical green `` city ' ' of islandia , a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents , limited access and an unlimited future .	76.77887
whatever land you can see here , from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward , belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land .	215.35663
and what you can ' t see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too .	64.20571
the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment .	126.505135
in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours .	142.18011
in this instance , happily , insistence is being made that our share is protected .	175.23419
and until this protection is at least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing .	142.61569
the reaction of certain city council members to california ' s newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing .	42.04477
we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide , and , therefore , had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public .	79.44253
in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the brown act , the legislature declares that `` the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people ' s business .	64.666626
it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly .	143.94255
`` the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them .	141.67268
the people , in delegating authority , do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know .	52.213474
the full implementation of these noble words , however , has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature .	30.687357
since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted , but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act .	118.32082
despite the lip service paid by local governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations .	44.94351
when all else fails , it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations .	170.44147
we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims .	41.583553
without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily .	188.65198
but the citizens would , of course , never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious .	124.93195
if the dominican republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the u . s . show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship .	68.70609
mr . balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .	100.40776
had u . s . warships not appeared off the dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war .	54.472248
ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba .	88.430824
within the organization of american states , there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously .	112.119835
but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo ' s waterfront shouting , `` vive yankees ' ' ! !	14.830817
more , the u . s . action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , dr . juan bosch , as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future ' ' .	60.380634
mr . balaguer ' s troubles are by no means over .	98.37861
he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike .	29.983139
in cooperating toward that objective , oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states .	53.611156
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 .	99.60677
now , as then , it is a matter of jobs .	41.30096
craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim , such as factory maintenance .	146.63968
the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members .	48.46282
that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations .	43.000546
or that ' s what it looked like at the time .	23.965572
but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs .	89.28255
walter reuther , leader of the industrial union faction of the afl-cio , says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor .	78.49648
whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as , say , jimmy hoffa of the teamsters , is a matter of conjecture .	44.00173
but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor .	143.10106
engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor ' s family feuds .	86.13156
the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive .	97.678055
the army , navy and air force , among others , may question secretary freeman ' s claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the `` strongest deterrent ' ' to the spread of communism .	65.53015
but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the `` greatest single source of strength ' ' in the struggle to insure freedom around the world .	42.796448
mr . freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america ' s capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the soviet ' s successes in space .	85.59377
american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time .	41.972134
in fact , over the years , the american farmer ' s capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar .	86.347
and thus far , mr . freeman has offered very little relief .	145.2158
the 1961 feed grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a billion dollar fiasco .	59.734913
in exchange for higher price supports , growers pledged reduction in planted acreage .	34.338997
but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer .	66.749756
the result $1 . 1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget .	26.030607
perhaps , as mr . freeman says , american agriculture may stop the communists , but it is also swindling the american taxpayer .	49.08073
a senate subcommittee headed by sen . jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions .	91.42907
the department needs a clearer `` sense of direction ' ' at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , sen . jackson says .	61.056793
the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department .	38.683353
president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance .	27.707205
but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first of all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes .	160.90672
nor does sen . jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy .	42.41239
this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates .	144.59593
but competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what sen . jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them ' ' .	90.49294
the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr . rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged , as sen . jackson puts it , `` in work that does not really need doing ' ' .	83.248146
mr . rusk should also draw comfort from sen . jackson ' s recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved .	53.645256
self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress .	50.125042
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist .	42.395813
but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends .	77.36106
james p . mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn ' t drop below three million a couple of years ago .	66.3752
he lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora .	23.993284
his successor , secretary goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months .	50.40492
no betting man , mr . goldberg says he ' s merely `` putting my neck out again ' ' by predicting the rate will go down this month .	75.05385
he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods .	96.1848
mr . mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated .	215.09514
mr . goldberg has less reason for missing .	24.049627
the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can ' t be blamed in november .	104.29615
the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary ' s neck may be spared .	27.687956
cambodia ' s chief of state , who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand , insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia .	61.92477
but so convinced of communism ' s inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel .	40.761757
`` i have to see the facts ' ' , is the way the prince puts it .	38.523354
and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western posture .	193.36615
prince sihanouk ' s powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions .	82.10845
commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington ' s economic forecasters .	85.71504
weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement .	65.36114
recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr . hodges ' appraisal , though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house .	43.42107
and now mr . hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point .	76.48333
he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .	59.179234
the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales .	22.751036
february ' s volume was 1 per cent above january ' s for the first pickup since last october , although it ' s still 1 . 5 per cent off from february 1960 .	49.017296
corroborating mr . hodges ' figures was the federal reserve board ' s report of the large sales increase in the nation ' s department stores for the week ending march 4 .	37.966934
in newark , for example , this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level .	35.05048
of course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 .	57.919266
another optimistic sign , this one from the labor department , was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments `` was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb . 25 ' ' .	51.24951
initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8 , 100 in the week ending march 4 .	63.04669
mr . hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn ' t think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes .	37.40365
well , we can ' t have everything .	19.64683
prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut .	37.353344
new jersey folk need not be told of the builder ' s march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain .	111.5586
now the stone harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state .	65.664246
against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline , the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant .	38.128628
but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves .	83.85296
the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30 , 000 acres of cape cod , from provincetown to chatham , is strengthened by president kennedy ' s interest in that area .	34.535843
but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country .	118.81491
by comparison , stone harbor bird sanctuary ' s allies seem less formidable , for aside from the audubon society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle egrets and the louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there .	113.889915
but there is hope , for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space .	101.15485
the desirability of preserving such places as the cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .	72.03785
public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing .	61.101036
much of the glamor president kennedy ' s peace corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent shriver , the head corpsman .	86.47448
anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to mr . shriver , get off the train right now .	87.54472
first of all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling .	56.097782
then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different .	104.009636
and the pay , of course , will be nil .	29.69055
despite all this , the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else .	101.55647
the study of the st . louis area ' s economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st . louis survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois countryside .	97.95946
st . louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region .	44.0486
slackened regional demand for st . louis goods and services reflects the region ' s relative lack of purchasing power .	59.00794
not all st . louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood .	76.21996
but for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core .	29.360504
the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois .	76.404236
gov . dalton ' s new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry .	79.44761
another would be to take the advice of dr . elmer ellis , president of the university of missouri , and provide for an impartial professional analysis of missouri ' s economy .	35.853916
he says the state , in order to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy .	69.10893
the research center of the university ' s school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr . ellis has been talking about .	75.48519
he and dean john w . schwada of the business school outlined the project at a recent conference .	73.31737
the university can make a valuable contribution to the state ' s economic development through such a study .	35.62783
in southern illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth .	92.46487
the carbondale industrial development corp . has obtained a $500 , 000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs .	65.611694
carbondale is in the herrin-murphysboro-west frankfort labor market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average .	29.028095
the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri ' s depressed areas , and in the long run that will benefit st . louis as well .	51.63808
politics-ridden st . clair county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development .	53.02368
more industrial acreage lies vacant in st . clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st . louis area .	45.90511
the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side .	103.42315
and then there is st . louis county , where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth .	75.44201
st . louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests .	169.6954
some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st . louis county doesn ' t want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lost .	75.32407
metropolitan st . louis ' s relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi .	52.655285
without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area ' s economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and st . louis will slip into second-class status .	44.201057
many of our very best friends are reformers .	2.1130319
still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far .	48.802456
take , for example , the reformers among new york city ' s democrats .	22.76463
having whipped mr . de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall , they have changed the name to chatham hall .	134.2638
even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick ? ?	82.42055
granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame , the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit .	90.5583
but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name .	104.414825
after all , it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-american , the days in which the sons of st . tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the british government , that is .	64.20082
further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ? ?	56.494507
they will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant .	47.665222
instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger ' s stripes are not black ? ?	65.7473
the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official , col . mariano faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration service .	88.79552
the faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds .	9.546784
the kennedy administration had assured anti-castro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator batista .	55.33691
using a batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro .	73.000435
moreover , col . faget ' s information on cuba was too outdated to be useful in `` screening ' ' castro agents	123.934616
the colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power .	72.29514
and while he had headed batista ' s anti-communist section , the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be communists .	101.895775
responsibility for the faget appointment rests with gen . j . m . swing , an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service .	26.914886
gen . swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office .	80.0834
some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend , congressman walter of pennsylvania , at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get .	69.585464
congressman walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 .	23.824465
at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen . swing .	239.4915
the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat .	73.35845
as president , dwight d . eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics .	79.43094
as a former president , however , mr . eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new york republican rally , and generally missed his target .	106.12768
mr . eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a `` juvenile experiment ' ' and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon .	94.989265
nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad .	61.314415
his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding .	66.65536
the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of `` dollarette ' ' dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies .	167.10713
it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit .	13.062818
finally , mr . eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington .	53.78791
this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis , when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too .	118.79859
the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded .	62.81428
ex-presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words .	149.84866
some of former president truman ' s off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein .	56.913094
nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics , but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility .	78.19433
this is a matter of respect for the presidency .	51.341408
mr . eisenhower ' s new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship .	162.69185
the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable british service on the high seas .	48.4893
reports that the venerable liner , which has been in service since 1936 , was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us .	78.49821
but the cunard line , influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least .	172.64468
a new queen , with the prosaic title of q3 , had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary .	33.56016
the british government , concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry , had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling $50 , 400 , 000 toward the $84 , 000 , 000 cost of a new 75 , 000-ton passenger liner .	47.637604
since 1957 , more and more trans-atlantic passengers have been crossing by air .	91.61123
economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines .	110.91954
competition from other steamship lines has cut cunard ' s share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run .	69.62854
the cunard line has under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than 75 , 000 tons .	97.95951
this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months .	61.507565
also under consideration is an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to serve new york .	74.081
the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation .	122.19705
gen . maxwell taylor ' s statement in saigon that he is `` very much encouraged ' ' about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to bolster the vietnamese army .	52.60795
gen . taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and , judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east , he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources .	49.07118
there was good reason for gen . taylor to make an inspection trip at this time .	55.337936
communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a new crisis .	43.02268
south viet nam ' s rice surplus for next year -- more than 300 , 000 tons -- may have been destroyed .	29.568235
the viet cong , the communist rebels , may have lost their stored grain and arms factories .	168.33733
the rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in november .	79.071785
nothing that is likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions .	93.84586
the indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 , when gen . ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing .	73.4325
it is a war to stay out of today , especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops .	81.015305
he may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming .	41.406406
south viet nam has received $1 , 450 , 000 , 000 in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b . johnson ' s visit last may .	47.49705
gen . taylor , the president ' s special military adviser , is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure .	57.569138
it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an asian morass .	57.597965
gov . john m . dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly , or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence .	109.39407
ambassador stevenson yesterday described the u . n . ' s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced ' ' .	36.93738
if the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as mr . stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill ' ' to a u . n . without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning .	74.06483
the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be , as the charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the organization ' ' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the organization ' ' .	58.05672
in other words , the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one .	78.7093
he should be , as dag hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .	30.483498
the charter does stipulate that `` due regard ' ' shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible ' ' .	75.21898
the united states and its allies have had no objection to this .	23.814934
what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold ' s death to turn the entire u . n . staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come .	68.92654
the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them .	73.6065
although the united states and the u . s . s . r . have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work .	41.245262
if any one of them has any power to veto the secretary general ' s decisions the nature of the organization will have changed .	45.978607
if they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the u . n . will not of necessity change .	68.31169
the secretary general must have , subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else ' s instructions .	56.28923
this is the root issue for which the united states should stand .	52.835968
we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography .	212.82877
what we must have , if the united nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation ' s direction and subservient to no single nation ' s ambition .	60.246468
the new city charter , which should get a yes vote as question no . 1 on nov . 7 , would not make a good mayor out of a bad one .	113.44395
there is no such magic in man-made laws .	3.2854538
but it would greatly strengthen any mayor ' s executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the board of estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy .	86.419044
lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor .	54.422413
thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative .	92.40938
the board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions .	46.882393
the board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget items , subject to the mayor ' s veto	123.46045
but the city council will now share fully this budget-altering power .	175.30348
overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council , and a two-thirds vote .	78.965
the controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog ' ' functions	18.310602
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed .	139.94719
he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the finance department .	75.14947
on net balance , in spite of controller gerosa ' s opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office , the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now .	62.447426
borough presidents , while retaining membership in the board of estimate , lose their housekeeping functions .	156.28265
highways go to a new department of highways , sewers to the department of public works , such street cleaning as borough presidents now do ( in queens and richmond ) to the sanitation department .	96.759674
the expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department .	102.840645
the capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises	174.95634
but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds .	268.71384
a road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected .	196.83698
this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business	640.2381
enlargement of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow .	111.42086
the inter-american press association , which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn , is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years .	58.419926
the i . a . p . a . is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere	36.084496
and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution .	41.82535
as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime , more and more cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile .	44.100185
the i . a . p . a . found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before batista ' s dictatorship began in 1952 .	89.21687
freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances .	165.59953
this , in more diplomatic language , is what adlai stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government .	60.64966
he felt able to end on a note of hope .	29.154516
he sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms .	237.93562
no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american press association .	37.509254
the twenty-second soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced .	113.77691
according to the original program , premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the `` bold program for building communism in our time ' ' which the congress will adopt .	132.26639
but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by 1980 , the world is watching moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future .	113.37971
the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russia ' s progress painted by the communist party ' s program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier khrushchev ' s berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered .	63.31301
whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated .	73.44336
and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive .	136.99026
this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years .	97.541595
the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress , and the central committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job .	103.4517
dr . james b . conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer .	39.174564
his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change .	109.50623
now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including new york , has shattered this optimism .	69.9797
dr . conant has come away shocked and angry .	87.73579
his new book , entitled `` slums and suburbs ' ' , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster .	62.825935
there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr . conant ' s specific views .	39.595425
his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment .	100.78787
dr . conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality .	178.44933
his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend .	225.07321
but these are side issues to a powerful central theme .	43.534805
that theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk .	8.708324
it labels the slums , especially the negro slums , as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters .	37.78746
the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and dr . conant accuses employers and labor unions alike .	153.14525
the facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools , regardless of the color of their students .	126.99408
a call for action `` before it is too late ' ' has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures .	99.63817
dr . conant ' s conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation ' s gratitude .	107.0529
he has served in positions of greater glamour , both at home and abroad	72.5076
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools .	49.91784
a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail .	99.25104
he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers .	111.98263
in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress , each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district .	62.861958
this means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis .	129.37846
occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten .	72.55817
most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter .	121.5142
old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery .	24.988554
she had , she said , heard that the plant was closing .	81.84831
it couldn ' t close , she said .	4.0452347
she had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat .	34.2512
she had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear .	62.270084
she was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter .	80.11884
she had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food .	84.89169
this did not happen in counties of north georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land .	103.54004
nor in south georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields .	174.87794
this happened in decatur , dekalb county , not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian atlanta .	133.52823
and now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the dekalb county cannery .	45.315697
`` is it so the cannery is going to close ' ' ? ?	15.57515
o . n . moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , didn ' t know what to say .	52.87871
he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer .	59.356544
he did say he was out of cans , the no . 3 ' s , but `` i requisitioned 22 , 000 ' ' .	65.84108
he said he had no . 2 ' s enough to last two weeks more .	60.048347
threat of closing the cannery is a recent one .	36.274742
a three-man committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o . emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed .	24.540903
reason the cannery loses $3 , 000 yearly .	94.23469
but dekalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money .	31.547516
`` the cannery ' ' , said mrs . lewellyn lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the `` victory garden ' ' produce , `` is a service to the taxpayer .	60.60216
and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up .	90.479095
`` the county , though , seems more interested in those people who don ' t even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food ' ' .	101.795006
a driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a . m . finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , `` what in the world will we do ' ' ? ?	66.5325
`` what in the world ' ' , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , `` will any of us do ' ' ? ?	103.41752
moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn ' t believe it will close .	34.406013
but he is in the middle , an employe of dekalb , but on the side of the people .	42.29799
`` don ' t ask me if i think the cannery helps ' ' , he said .	8.103438
`` sir , i know the cannery helps ' ' .	3.517523
most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard .	208.27367
when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say , `` just forget it ' ' .	32.48035
a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge .	75.25938
i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades .	42.11599
one night , at the close of the evening service , he came forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god .	61.547115
after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land .	93.04621
`` we tried to settle this dispute ' ' , he said , `` but could never come to an agreement .	16.677845
i settled it tonight ' ' , he continued .	136.88391
`` i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor ' ' .	46.28317
forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god .	28.790464
you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart .	53.803135
henry van dyke said , `` forgive and forget if you can	50.806984
we must , first of all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure god ' s forgiveness .	34.56903
`` for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive -- your trespasses ' ' .	58.88505
it will do no good to seek god ' s forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong .	49.730225
then , jesus indicated that god ' s forgiveness is unlimited .	44.93224
in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , `` forgive us our debts ' ' .	48.111492
when a person meets god ' s requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven .	35.95852
god ' s mercy and patience will last forever .	69.77052
forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by god ' s love .	47.375294
it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past .	44.3641
we want the past forgiven , but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future .	38.30874
finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us .	119.52345
once peter asked , `` how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? ?	33.808132
jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven ' ' .	38.306473
jesus not only taught forgiveness , he gave us an example of it on the cross .	51.91967
with all the energy of his broken body he prayed , `` father , forgive them , for they know not what they do ' ' .	40.879307
she ' s been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she ' s still a teen-ager who looks like a baby , she is getting married .	57.1061
her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said .	82.3174
for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldn ' t have made myself heard if i ' d had the equivalent of the message to garcia .	57.57979
but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute .	70.5904
`` how do you know you love somebody enough to get married ' ' ? ?	21.915129
it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked how can you be sure ? ?	52.850445
`` aren ' t you sure ' ' ? ?	3.0527341
i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important .	133.68623
but if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage .	98.63417
besides , in all honesty , i don ' t know how you can be sure .	7.6904955
i don ' t know any secret recipe for certainty .	52.750954
in the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured .	155.80429
i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth .	71.35717
`` does he ever bore you ' ' ? ?	2.8939605
why , he ' s so darling and ' '	17.37051
`` i mean ' ' , i went on ruthlessly , `` when he ' s not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting ? ?	61.801468
does he care about things that matter to you ? ?	21.10178
can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ? ?	160.57231
because , honey , i thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you ' re hopelessly stranded , together .	73.445045
and if you bore each other then , heaven help you .	318.0161
she came back the other day to reassure me .	9.795637
she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting .	56.203625
she asked if i had other advice and , heady with success , i rushed it in , i hope not too late .	160.60004
jokes , cartoons and cynics to the contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends .	213.06322
i do not know dr . wilson sneed well .	399.4372
but i was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st . luke ' s church in atlanta .	34.0518
it was the cry of not just one heart	2196.5894
it spoke for many in the clergy , i suspect .	134.9784
imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church .	141.17392
`` such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments ' ' , he told his members .	72.62476
a minister should not stay `` beyond the time that his leadership should benefit ' ' his church , he wrote , `` for he becomes ordinary .	169.0884
and so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when `` i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you ' ' .	87.65705
his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister , a modest methodist , who said `` i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and i would have it no other way and it is unworthy to think of self .	87.38
but oh , how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself ' ' .	50.486404
a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving .	73.17151
he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach .	67.60631
the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity .	149.1025
theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards .	2.1172154
yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul .	185.1814
we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and god ' s .	66.110085
we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week , american cash .	127.52304
if we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins .	117.88432
if he won ' t break , we add to the stress he bears .	226.46269
and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to .	149.85509
we expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be .	129.8504
we expect bestowal of god ' s love through him .	62.638084
the church truly is not a rest home for saints , but a hospital for sinners .	66.2485
yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers , too .	91.47277
mr . podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake .	56.849297
the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure .	416.8229
the evening was not always spent in the same way .	10.270369
this year , on a night cool with the front of september moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod .	152.27356
the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages .	106.711945
in the midst of it all , mr . podger came out on the pod porch , alone .	31.863586
he had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize .	33.041214
the prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging .	39.331093
mrs . podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .	49.48392
mr . podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it .	115.31651
he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him .	81.371414
suddenly one young voice rose above the others .	9.371774
`` but ' ' , it said , `` do you always know when you ' re happy ' ' ? ?	14.962899
the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in mr . podger ' s mind .	38.288467
here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , mr . podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace .	54.9908
it had begun with the blue jay feather .	10.796896
walking along the lake before breakfast , mr . podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight .	54.8246
the winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood .	54.548695
the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .	43.812332
all day long mr . podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield .	34.816257
would a blue feather in a man ' s hat make him happy all day ? ?	171.98422
but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake .	52.36386
then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it .	75.041824
and there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road .	153.42908
it was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr . podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car .	88.77499
would he take pains to avoid it ? ?	1.0472845
taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , mr . podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness .	50.523262
the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .	222.1144
but mr . podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .	77.73631
here in the cool darkness mr . podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight .	77.45954
for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .	137.59224
the three would never meet again , but for some reason or other mr . podger was sure he would always remember the incident .	87.8582
at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr . podger ' s hammock purchase .	43.645664
`` i like them things , too ' ' , he had said .	12.073944
if you ' re lyin ' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap ' em right over you .	106.71917
i do it , lots o ' times -- i like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it ' s all quiet .	75.28349
the wind moves it a little bit -- you know .	29.45486
mr . podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice .	59.014297
as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , mr . podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet .	62.887077
alacrity , the podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up .	112.44831
she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and mr . podger took her inside the fringe .	56.018368
soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod .	79.86725
mr . podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out .	65.3111
`` it ' s getting so chilly we ' ve lighted a fire , and we ' re going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one .	52.096962
why are you out here all by yourself ? ?	7.6588454
mr . podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire .	60.964104
`` of course i am ' ' , he said .	5.08245
i just came out here to know it ' ' .	3.6191778
as the south begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region ' s slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools .	148.9608
desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities -- dallas and atlanta .	44.275974
in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment .	123.09887
these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully .	20.231003
the programs do not take sides on the issue itself .	180.65979
they point out simply that `` it is the law of the land ' ' .	10.820921
the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation .	80.943985
even better , they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs .	111.93762
in each case there was an initial act of violence .	53.34057
in houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes , none of which were serious .	83.58325
in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents .	77.10625
the nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south .	86.03813
it is a `` stair-step ' ' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade .	66.054794
each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated .	366.56586
the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now ' ' .	43.89937
the program has worked well in both nashville and houston .	14.356564
it met a serious rebuff in new orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents .	87.81406
another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program .	39.616707
generally , throughout the south , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met .	77.52787
perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas .	87.3535
during the summer , negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments .	49.045017
it was part of a citywide move toward full integration .	100.29709
so successful has been this program , worked out by white and negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months .	38.697872
hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars .	79.877525
already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis .	107.53987
several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .	33.837624
this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of dallas .	57.7084
it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south .	75.49346
southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights .	161.26228
they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots .	114.05219
all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it .	228.29373
business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence .	48.565044
they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .	111.36503
in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way .	44.111195
and as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up .	35.495747
this co-operation has emboldened other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation .	47.485767
they realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise .	158.77766
since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago , i ' ve been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship .	23.13118
played mostly on the freeways around los angeles , it goes like this	198.53531
a driver cruising easily at 70 m . p . h . in lane a of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead .	47.42181
traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into lane b , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m . p . h . .	65.61301
the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him .	111.77804
he can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a	66.71173
( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes	677.1287
or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair .	102.36621
the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access .	227.9901
whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , i don ' t know .	26.781336
but it is done , consistently and i ' m both surprised and impressed .	85.98895
this could never happen in my native chicago .	7.2118516
there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood .	64.736725
in chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back .	122.36691
failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly .	39.73942
this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to southern california drivers .	99.15105
at the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at marshall field and company , i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype .	104.091896
after three months of research , i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i ' ve ever encountered .	78.51347
during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .	89.133575
an out-of-town writer came up to paul richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year .	122.850006
now richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go .	111.31777
he can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa .	31.008476
this happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece .	57.63025
`` it ' s a whole lot easier ' ' , he said , `` to increase the population of nevada , than it is to increase the population of new york city ' ' .	19.648165
and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher .	64.80739
`` that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote ' ' , said the writer , scratching his head .	32.296455
`` now , if i can just figure out what he ' s talking about , i ' ll use it ' ' .	22.874561
this was just richard ' s way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open .	182.43462
some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs .	188.83621
it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it hasn ' t worked that way .	62.776974
this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one .	59.459824
you ' d never guess it from the way they ' ve played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 .	74.42227
obviously , if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league , it will have to show improvement someplace .	55.461727
where can that improvement possibly come from ? ?	1.0144515
you certainly can ' t expect the infield to do any better than it did last year .	33.20054
brooks robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he ' ll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 .	82.62324
you can ' t expect it , though .	223.74301
robby ' s performance last year was tremendous .	5.2657833
it ' s the same with ron hansen and jim gentile .	10.472434
if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint .	59.611736
they shouldn ' t be asked to carry any more of the burden .	26.801508
hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back .	147.99869
he got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably won ' t duplicate it .	42.47023
there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year .	122.879585
they don ' t expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat .	232.4367
he ' ll still be a top player , they concede , because he ' s got a great glove and the long ball going for him .	43.197334
but they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production .	46.678444
gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs .	93.6255
i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch .	17.885649
but even so , he had a good year in 1960 and won ' t do too much better .	34.214653
so , all in all , the infield can ' t be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first .	83.94
and the pitching will also have trouble doing better .	19.555845
richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season .	291.42612
where , then , can we look for improvement ? ?	17.716366
`` from triandos , brandt and walker ' ' , answers richards .	107.84547
`` they ' re the ones we can expect to do better ' ' .	17.054152
the man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons .	100.80008
triandos hasn ' t proved it yet , but he says he ' s convinced his thumb is all right .	38.483204
he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury hasn ' t bothered him .	41.690388
if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively .	79.38989
i ' m still not convinced , though , i ' ll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him .	77.38833
hank foiles , backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors , make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year , but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant .	308.96402
to me , brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year .	80.35498
he hasn ' t played too much , because richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice .	164.18309
he ' s hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year .	62.62154
when he came to baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club .	69.73317
he was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field .	70.59558
as of now , that all seems behind him .	18.664145
he ' s been entirely different all spring .	5.6735225
and walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year .	57.811516
let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff .	92.21147
so , if the orioles are to improve , brandt , triandos and walker will have to do it .	46.203114
so far the platoons on left and right fielders don ' t seem capable of carrying the load .	65.87836
of course , this isn ' t taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city , but it ' s the way things look from here at this point .	42.17453
is the mother of an `` autistic ' ' child at fault ? ?	68.08332
( the `` autistic ' ' child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self .	61.77354
he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people .	96.436325
) did his mother make him this way ? ?	16.286175
we believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn .	74.762634
a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties .	143.25679
sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them .	155.51718
but we don ' t think she creates them .	35.007824
we don ' t think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic .	162.51971
the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem .	58.1301
since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we ' d like to share one experienced mother ' s comments .	99.971825
as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , i have to manipulate my son ' s fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy .	56.043564
he wants me to do everything for him .	3.788774
`` you don ' t believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them .	134.26706
but i do and my psychiatrist does , too .	35.658447
i know , that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction .	197.29346
`` one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned .	233.64505
this is that autistic people don ' t enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and i .	46.039413
when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board .	84.07957
he pushes and straightens himself as if he can ' t stand the feeling of being held .	45.784172
physical contact is uncomfortable for him ' ' ! !	12.480796
as a rule , the autistic child doesn ' t enjoy physical contact with others .	10.9013605
parents have to find other ways of comforting him .	79.50585
for the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement .	128.35297
as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his `` magic ' ' thing ) .	138.11766
or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick .	166.425
the answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer .	53.717545
`` dear doctors we learned this year that our older son , daniel , is autistic .	92.40924
we did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to .	89.38282
fortunately , there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children .	27.723507
`` i try to treat daniel as if he were normal , though of course i realize he is far from that at present .	107.47738
what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible .	46.939926
i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible .	41.65157
`` what is your experience with autistic children ? ?	5.1831384
how do they turn out later ' ' ? ?	2.3409102
many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives .	98.12856
certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood .	114.69601
-- a first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything -- sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc . .	56.854992
when different colors are used , she is just as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc . .	88.92967
the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color .	196.58353
should i show my daughter how things should be colored ? ?	33.221466
is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? ?	160.95622
-- her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects .	165.64297
this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade .	38.923546
no , coloring isn ' t exactly something you teach a child .	151.4344
you sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines .	101.57115
but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration .	81.21291
seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art embroidery .	119.11295
possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed .	58.585545
just as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery .	141.84499
one such , in fact , is a rug .	340.894
though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background .	92.91914
the twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england .	74.58677
traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country .	52.1213
the work is executed in england ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color .	66.18263
among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color .	100.38732
for a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine english chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically chinese-inspired design of this revered eighteenth century period .	32.957733
since the work is done by hand , the only limitation , it is said , `` is that of human conception ' ' .	33.317764
modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of this trend .	44.64848
these have never gone out of style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts .	148.23642
an amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking up her living room color scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room .	71.92753
california democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards .	135.56659
and they ' re confident that the gop , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine .	54.628223
their meeting at san francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the california democratic council directorate .	31.728424
but it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people ' ' .	29.463078
-- plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in los angeles next december that would enlist top-drawer democrats from all over the country .	41.38366
-- blueprints for doubling the cdc ' s present 55 , 000 enrollment .	50.2146
-- arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in fresno next jan . 26-28 .	57.146248
-- and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state ' s 38 new congressional districts .	81.14649
at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox , 39-year-old amateur politico , thomas b . carvey jr . , whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircraft ' s moon missiles .	92.750084
he ' s approached his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion .	250.38213
viewed from afar , the cdc looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so .	159.49338
much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer ' ' democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the aj .	108.13399
moreover , the entire state democratic hierarchy , from gov . brown on down to the county chairmen , also participates in this huge operation .	142.6618
contrarily , republican `` volunteers ' ' go their separate ways , and thus far have given no indication that they ' d be willing to join forces under a single directorate , except in the most loose-knit fashion .	78.66473
carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase cdc membership .	322.32745
where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth .	131.54102
biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting up cdc units in rock-ribbed democratic territory .	132.43257
paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party ' s favor , strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis .	153.82906
like most democratic spokesmen , carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously `` partisan year ' ' .	41.030304
hence the attention they ' re lavishing on the aj .	38.55976
in all probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress , and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites .	65.15296
this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who don ' t see eye-to-eye with the aj .	68.13103
naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council .	88.050835
shunted aside by the rampant organizers for john f . kennedy last year , who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential campaign , the cdc plainly intends to provide the party ' s campaign muscle in 1962 .	45.108707
there is evidence that it will be happily received by gov . brown and the other constitutional incumbents .	30.862286
carvey considers that former vice president nixon would be brown ' s most formidable foe , with ex-gov . knight a close second .	96.17737
but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants don ' t worry him very much .	40.248882
in his cdc work , carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of california ' s shrewdest political strategists former democratic national committeeman paul ziffren , who backed him over a northland candidate espoused by atty . gen . stanley mosk .	52.978596
( significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw mosk moving into the national committee post over ziffren are still audible in party circles .	281.7922
note we ' ve just received an announcement of the 54th assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention wednesday night in south pasadena ' s war memorial bldg . , which graphically illustrates the cdc ' s broad appeal .	60.04749
state and county committeemen , cdc directors and representatives , members of 16 area clubs , and `` all residents ' ' have been invited .	62.985302
this is going to be a language lesson , and you can master it in a few minutes .	43.540367
it works with english , russian , german , hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue .	79.87559
once you learn how to translate communese , much of each day ' s deluge of news will become clearer .	101.92429
at least , i have found it so .	59.187927
for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated dr . freud , communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves .	96.63458
they accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty .	76.70744
president kennedy ' s latest warning to the communist world that the united states will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was , somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the iron curtain .	94.86695
then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency .	59.750813
moscow radio from the literary gazette in english to england	30.46084
`` president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals , to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism .	59.167072
evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the west have been planned long in advance .	105.15216

`` president kennedy ' s enlargement of the american military program was welcomed on wall street as a stimulus to the american munitions industry .	70.80213
when the stock exchange opened this morning , many dealers were quick to purchase shares in douglas , lockheed and united aircraft and prices rose substantially .	138.51305

tass datelined los angeles , in english to europe	203.84656
`` former vice president nixon came out in support of president kennedy ' s program for stepping up the arms race .	37.63985
he also demanded that kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension specifically to crush the cuban revolution , resume nuclear testing , resist more vigorously admission of china to its lawful seat in the united nations , and postpone non-military programs at home ' ' .	86.08693
`` the american press clamored for many days promising president kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the united states .	69.73118
in fact , the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current president .	80.02534
if there were no west berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the united states and its nato partners .	61.92855
washington apparently decided to use an old formula , by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the u . s . economy after a prolonged slump ' ' .	43.334084
`` the u . s . president has shown once again that the united states needs the fanning of the west berlin crisis to justify the armaments race .	71.87655
as was to be expected kennedy ' s latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in bonn , where officials of the west german government praised it ' ' .	72.68549
`` u . s . pressure on britain to foster war hysteria over the status of west berlin has reached its apogee .	89.83185
the present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary britons shows that this british common sense is unwilling to pull somebody else ' s chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures ' ' .	114.23437
east berlin ( communist ) radio in german to germany	118.47738
`` a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech .	96.18654
kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty .	80.83856
whenever some washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn .	128.73262
in kennedy ' s speech are cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the president ' s advisers and the political and economic forces behind them .	64.86189
well , dear listeners , despite all the shouting , there will be no war over west berlin ' ' .	36.300056
`` chairman khrushchev received the u . s . president ' s disarmament adviser , john mccloy .	37.17178

now , to translate from the communese , this means	341.34457
the `` west berlin ' ' crisis is really an east berlin crisis .	77.763565
the crisis was artificially stirred up by the kremlin ( wall street ) and the red army ( pentagon ) egged on by the west germans ( east germans ) .	61.005196
the reason was to speed up domestic production in the ussr , which khrushchev promised upon grabbing power , and try to end the permanent recession in russian living standards .	118.58823
chairman khrushchev ( kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position .	47.535423
his advisers in the politburo ( white house ) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions , so he is not always consistent .	50.343292

aug . 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after benjamin franklin founded the pennsylvania gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening post .	100.124535
the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c . atkinson and charles alexander , who had just taken over franklin ' s old paper , desired a more distinctive name .	90.94443
when founded by franklin the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction , poetry , and literary essays .	180.41978
in the middle of the century , with a circulation of 90 , 000 , the post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country .	21.609684
but during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 cyrus h . k . curtis purchased it -- `` paper , type , and all ' ' -- for $1 , 000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany , and with only some 2 , 000 subscribers .	82.72778
little more than a fine old name , valuable principally because of the franklin tradition , the saturday evening post was slow to revive .	102.94657
but curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country .	30.259481

the 350th anniversary of the king james bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament , the first part of the new english bible , undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english .	36.356293
since it was issued in the spring of 1611 , the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible .	48.61348
however , biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced .	87.01422
this resulted in revisions of the king james bible in 1881-85 as the english revised version and in 1901 as the american standard version .	47.637833
then in 1937 america ' s international council of religious education authorized a new revision , in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages .	48.89366
undertaken by 32 american scholars , under the chairmanship of rev . dr . luther a . weigle , former dean of yale university divinity school , their studies resulted in the publishing of the revised standard version , 1946-52 .	35.937325
the new english bible ( the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version , but , as its cover states , it is offered `` simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship ' ' .	70.81881
time , of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose .	94.83548
bible reading , even more so than good classical music , grows in depth and meaning upon repetition .	158.31409
if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the king james version .	143.63353
however , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars .	71.02815
one is impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english , and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james .	34.221165
for example , in the third chapter of matthew , verses 13-16 , describing the baptism of jesus , the 1611 version reads	46.92042
`` then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .	64.41995
`` but john forbad him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ? ?	50.361065
`` and jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness .	170.44156
`` and jesus , when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove , and lighting upon him ' ' .	57.491665
certainly , the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings , in the new english bible which reads `` then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee , and he came to john to be baptized by him .	41.41555
' do you come to me ' ? ?	1.0854913
' i need rather to be baptized by you .	30.674088
jesus replied , ' let it be so for the present	68.822105
we do well to conform this way with all that god requires .	169.86646
after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once , and at that moment heaven opened	162.57411
he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him ' '	28.544153
( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version .	75.27082
among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes and yet so few persons , other than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount .	86.75429
to illustrate , the first blessing in the king james bible reads `` blessed are the poor in spirit	121.41308
for their ' s is the kingdom of heaven ' ' .	6.2360735
the new version states `` how blest are those who know that they are poor	33.57742
the kingdom of heaven is theirs ' ' .	1.7766533
some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the english language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar .	91.22853
in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase `` angel of the church ' ' which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop .	65.12631
for the most part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ .	70.001396
originally recorded by hand , these words have been copied and recopied , translated and retranslated through the ages .	54.640106
discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church fathers , in themselves called for a restudy of the bible .	67.09891
to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth .	138.08063
with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic .	164.74467
the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england , church of scotland , methodist church , congregational union , baptist union , presbyterian church of england , churches in wales , churches in ireland , society of friends , british and foreign bible society and national society of scotland .	52.93548
prof . c . h . dodd , 76 , a congregational minister and a leading authority on the new testament , is general director of the project and chairman of the new testament panel .	38.200577
sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet .	86.44983
that is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes .	82.58022
there are many soft and light shoe leathers available .	268.3108
many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers .	60.482525
styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape .	33.070156
heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette .	3.3083286
wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights .	56.78452
stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes .	30.858322
just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps .	143.48183
while white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color .	49.131893
in the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures .	25.730352
don ' t overlook the straws this year .	3.1424356
they come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors .	39.707157
in the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles .	69.83107
for added comfort some of the italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning .	19.25383
the citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot .	30.01977
orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac .	30.070967
in a brighter nautical vein is ille de france blue .	222.32927
spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan .	37.40529
designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated .	11.4141035
at the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture .	29.492716
in a lacey open weave shoes have a luster finish , braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat .	37.363697
at right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather .	38.060097
an electric toothbrush ( broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the american bathroom .	58.06749
the brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth .	90.65378
in addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the underwriters laboratories , which means it is safe .	64.16705
the unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in .	87.38957
the speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor .	143.68025
the brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own .	63.527115
most of us brush our teeth by hand .	5.0090446
the same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men .	53.58755
the electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend .	86.39559
in addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth .	33.07602
the bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel .	230.73424
it is conceivable that broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly .	78.098495
several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device .	64.335075
the results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly .	90.7324
the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy .	66.29473
but for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury .	237.44678
it is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles .	36.900078
since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique .	161.34798
writes does numbness in the left hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain tumor ? ?	154.08107
this is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand .	190.60999
the pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand .	49.934826
writes do steam baths have any health value ? ?	4.8384223
no , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder .	58.09131
an ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same .	32.517296
writes what makes my hands numb when sewing ? ?	20.983385
there are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders .	31.916286
this manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer ' s cramp .	57.923656
writes does a brace help in sciatica ? ?	1.040183
a back brace might help , depending upon the cause of sciatica .	28.42477
writes does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ? ?	21.772083
the cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body .	10.403158
it is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish .	59.58951
the latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed .	33.11701
the gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue .	268.28674
there ' s more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as thomas alva edison ' s first experiment in recorded sound .	100.3531
edison could hardly have guessed , however , that sophocles would one day appear in stereo .	230.02194
if the record buyer ' s tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records .	82.79412
and he will avoid eye-strain in the process .	12.909732
everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable .	162.86206
for sheer ambition , take the decca series titled modestly `` wisdom ' ' .	20.12862
volumes one and two , selected from the sound tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise men of our day ' ' .	72.9943
these sages include poet carl sandburg , statesman jawaharlal nehru and sculptor jacques lipchitz , in volume one , and playwright sean o ' casey , david ben-gurion , philosopher bertrand russell and the late frank lloyd wright in the second set .	33.67211
hugh downs is heard interviewing wright , for an added prestige fillip .	46.97469
there ' s more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by dover publications .	85.88827
dover `` publishes ' ' what the company calls `` listen and learn ' ' productions designed to teach foreign languages .	58.795296
previous presentations have been on french , spanish , russian , italian , german and japanese .	21.204218
but the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist ' s desire to visit the `` smaller , less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries ' ' , and is now prepared to teach modern greek and portuguese through recordings .	53.352394
the respective vocabularies `` essential for travel ' ' are available in separate albums .	23.541569
thanks to spoken arts records , history buffs may hear lincoln ' s `` most memorable speeches and letters ' ' in a two-disc set , interpreted by lincoln authority and lecturer roy p . basler .	64.73937
as a contemporary bonus , the set includes carl sandburg ' s address at a joint session of congress , delivered on lincoln ' s birthday two years ago .	28.41099
for those who `` like poetry but never get around to reading it ' ' , the library of congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work .	74.0287
the program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the recording laboratory of the library of congress , washington 25 , d . c . .	33.87519
newest on the list are john ciardi , w . d . snodgrass , i . a . richards , oscar williams , robert hillyer , john hall wheelock , stephen vincent benet , edwin muir , john peal bishop and maxwell bodenheim .	39.638508
two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above .	75.00555
decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction .	143.34125
rca victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` adventures in music ' ' , which is an instructional record library for elementary schools .	58.102665
howard mitchell and the national symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two .	104.612816
in an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future , herbert a . leggett , banker-editor of the phoenix `` arizona progress ' ' , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties .	66.96909
one of the roughest was the tv quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes .	82.78252
though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed american .	93.94508
but the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2 , 000 , 000 profit on the stock market .	52.896317
every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb .	141.10548
investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough .	160.49493
people who take us for suckers are like the westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull ' s-eye achievements .	59.457584
the promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it .	38.679413
he just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull ' s-eye .	47.322914
one of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication .	41.613625
if his mother loves him , he clings to that love as a ballast .	64.79345
he wants mommy to think him a good boy .	68.73329
he doesn ' t want her to look frowningly at him , or speak to him angrily .	76.10589
he wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother ' s little helper .	35.140106
but even mother ' s loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior .	156.0696
his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother ' s love for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them .	51.683777
his own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed .	60.15071
it won ' t develop until he has words with which to clothe it .	225.33652
what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ?	13.397702
the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be .	118.75442
she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child .	106.69984
if he can ' t play with mommy ' s magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own .	70.16651
if daddy ' s books are out of bounds his own picture books are not .	122.084885
toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .	56.717216
during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child ' s conscience .	33.19352
she tells him of the consequences of his behavior .	60.751484
if he bites a playmate she says , `` danny won ' t like you ' ' .	22.904074
if he snatches a toy , she says , `` caroline wants her own truck just as you do ' ' .	34.504795
there is no use trying to `` explain ' ' to a 2-year-old .	12.428973
remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior .	37.740055
substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act .	68.7156
he won ' t submit to his natural desires all the time , and it ' s mother ' s love that is responsible for his good behavior .	43.98326
this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` homecoming day ' ' .	130.14323
they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes .	43.54527
the football opponent on homecoming is , of course , selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperor ' s lions .	89.19756
it is true , of course , the uncertainties of life being what they are , that as now and then the christian killed the lion , homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team .	171.63875
even with all possible precaution , homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them .	119.37314
more often than not , as the old grad wanders along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain .	86.48962
he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall .	101.489815
it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates , faces alight , holding hands and talking happily as they come along , oblivious of him , or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances , such as they would give a tethered goat .	131.634
usually , they titter loudly after they have passed by .	162.1164
he feels , suddenly , the weight of the fat that is on him .	43.26203
his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous .	148.60634
his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walked for miles , instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths .	56.74102
bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth .	83.15332
it is not much better if he meets with old classmates .	31.087912
too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by .	471.513
he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said , on returning from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn ' t even recognize him .	59.91643
if they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon is done .	123.761696
after all , when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children , and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it .	185.5123
by then one begins to notice the middle-age spread	302.076
the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that are too thin or too heavy	118.05066
the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then , it is time to break it up and move on .	92.65903
it is , if anything , worse on the old player	156.51675
he sits in the stands and he doesn ' t like that .	14.462646
enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd .	64.6942
on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him .	101.760254
in the stands he is lonely and lost , no matter how many are about him .	43.52175
he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped	48.701252
the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants	19.351934
the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face .	27.59773
and so , he squirms with each play , remembering his youth .	88.42986
no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recaptured again .	57.18646
since the obvious is not always true , the republican national committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities .	107.33556
of 40 cities with populations of 300 , 000 and more , mr . kennedy carried 26 and mr . nixon 14 .	41.26896
there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election .	91.16995
these are new york , pennsylvania , michigan , maryland , missouri , new jersey , illinois and minnesota .	16.902967
in 1952 mr . eisenhower won all but missouri .	247.74776
yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to mr . kennedy .	21.808691
republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia .	3.908734
mr . nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so .	34.160564
his visit to warsaw , poland , after the russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial .	72.618286
yet , the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr . nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` polish ' ' vote	61.36352
30 per cent of the `` irish ' ' vote , and 18 per cent of the `` negro ' ' vote .	17.284372
a gop `` task force ' committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities .	114.2652
the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders .	80.438095
these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr . kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment .	80.25898
this error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one ' ' , and not a reality .	37.242435
the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical .	232.93555
they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor goldberg as politics , which the gop declared it to be .	131.41368
the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery .	134.83827
senator mundt ' s gross distortion of president eisenhower ' s conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy as too left wing , a statement mr . eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case in point .	82.447586
if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities .	116.936386
the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt , goldwater , bridges , dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s .	50.128723
in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr . hoover , and the party ' s failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash .	66.15622
the republican party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble .	108.47431
farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` hoover carts ' ' .	2.2492862
smokers reduced to `` the makings ' ' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` hoover dust ' ' .	70.82749
one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasn ' t meant to repeat this error .	25.670483
but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john f . kennedy .	116.51582
that this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nation ' s business .	44.442516
the most articulate republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at mr . kennedy , already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care .	70.29601
if they also defeat the school bill , the gop task force won ' t have much research to do .	89.42037
it will early know why the party won ' t win back city votes .	73.807526
the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider .	274.02237
the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner .	149.34598
after the griffin-byrd political troup has completed the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history .	58.258663
every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions .	130.60913
hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever .	270.492
and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor ' s race ' ' ? ?	31.466496
how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt . gov . garland byrd ' s senate committee on government operations ? ?	25.01344
the situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governor ' s race forward a few months , causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual .	139.3853
but when former gov . marvin griffin and lt . gov . byrd accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november , the situation was aggravated .	48.830227
neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation .	51.203213
to have refused would have been political suicide .	5.117419
and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast aside .	312.565
the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates .	85.110275
it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the `` serious candidates ' ' .	28.334684
but state party chairman james gray of albany said no , and he didn ' t mince any words .	62.81611
`` they are just asking too much ' ' , he said .	3.2593389
we can ' t think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either .	130.32271
`` if an opponent accuses you of lying , don ' t deny it .	17.041477
say he is a horse thief ' ' , runs an old adage .	65.65676
if either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end .	134.91951
griffin ' s rural roads authority and byrd ' s 60 , 000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper ' s oaths .	26.121784
the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one .	90.64954
why not have them travel the state in november debating ? ?	117.22032
it would present a forum for them in almost every community .	52.724285
but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor ' s race being run in the next legislature , the spectre of big spending programs , the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin .	89.79634
the chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum .	13.095542
if it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring , and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates , it can provide a service to the state .	67.09443

the providence journal editorial ( jan . 25 ) entitled `` east greenwich faces a housing development problem ' ' points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours .	132.2647
your suggested solution , it seems to me , is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning .	115.953255
first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested .	104.081276
this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town .	40.042942
the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come .	24.648804
this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither `` to halt an influx of migrants ' ' nor are we `` setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites ' ' .	132.01347
what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development .	43.178978
it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs .	120.44003
bostitch , inc . is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax .	70.517456
the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory .	91.39094
the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars .	47.520218
with our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant ' ' as the best way to meet these problems .	56.329884
in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure .	103.04936
as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow .	145.30986
mr . richard preston , executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission , in his remarks to the governors conference on industrial development at providence on october 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said `` if this is the fundamental reason for a community ' s interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain ' ' .	58.05478
he went on to say `` in the first place , industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities .	92.962265
it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be ' ' .	91.31374
while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth .	122.06888
we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year .	109.55815
it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase .	77.15071
if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning , what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage ? ?	193.4579
where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials ? ?	112.64784
i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life .	32.124104
the `` fruitful course ' ' of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called .	98.41407
the east greenwich police department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department , thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut area of the two communities .	60.537663

the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment .	35.061806
feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick , as reported in your newspapers , suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east greenwich .	85.59868
east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves .	90.49497
the education program for retarded children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community .	93.27357
i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich .	75.110016
i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts	239.19638
and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised .	106.619125
these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in what manner the community shall grow .	254.03456
we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions .	53.757374
until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny .	69.44803

a few weeks ago , i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston .	69.93453

the following week , i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade .	97.037544
i wish you could see the situation as i see it .	9.843878
if russian pupils have to take these languages , how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language , but have to face so many exceptions ? ?	167.66577
i do not think that america is like russia , not in the least ! !	54.10074
i am proud of my country , the small city i live in , my wonderful parents , my friends and my school	113.89236
but i am also a young , able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough .	114.32907

at the height of the first snowstorm we had , it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency .	92.139046

words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me .	209.74957
the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful .	43.76482
the rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather .	52.853733
had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did , perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time .	51.048637
the providence sunday journal article ( jan . 29 ) asking whether american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news .	105.25328
usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page .	147.35605
on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service .	41.47985
it can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later .	66.1514
there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter va hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected .	269.9085
no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years .	44.87663
the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public .	106.14944
i believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals .	61.60863
but i don ' t believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients .	392.13788
this matter is of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at least serious injuries , for many veterans .	54.309258
some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long .	54.524235
there ' s a reason for this length of stay .	77.93117
first of all , the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient .	60.154842
he has no experience with this veteran ' s previous medical record .	77.38995
if the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient .	36.397385
as a result , it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient .	55.77805
secondly , the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital , he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient .	46.78686
so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery .	70.20219
the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization .	99.705185
the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other .	54.452938
the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital .	38.567463
an adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals .	83.85471
it seems that open season upon veterans ' hospitalization is once more upon us .	155.66905
the american medical association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer .	86.4307
do they , the a . m . a . , offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world ? ?	98.23886
we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness .	174.70491
nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the a . m . a . on the health problem confronting the aged .	49.287537
they opposed the forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction	164.41437
yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate .	130.27257
-- no doubt there have been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration , exasperation , exhaustion , and even panic .	48.20463
but no president ever before referred to his as a `` lousy job ' ' ( as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen . barry goldwater ) .	64.58506
during his aggressive campaign to win his present position , mr . kennedy was vitriolic about this country ' s `` prestige ' ' abroad .	32.07582
what does he think a remark like this `` lousy ' ' one does to our prestige and morale ? ?	58.0676
if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a `` lousy job ' ' , then heaven help us all .	69.38629
-- defense secretary robert s . mcnamara has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars .	75.4998

top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time .	55.320633
the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground , sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter .	50.306618
this sum spent for foreign economic aid , the peace corps , food for peace , or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace , increased world trade , and prosperity for every country on the globe .	68.31095
let us prepare for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization .	68.46904
-- it seems college isn ' t what it should be .	26.193068

is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years ? ?	56.733284
education should be uppermost in their minds , but with this attire how can anyone think it is so ? ?	100.840996
it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves .	139.44473
high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students .	111.846176

-- in reply to a letter in today ' s `` voice ' ' urging the sale of meat after 6 p . m . , i wish to state the other side of the story .	39.07682
i am the wife of the owner of a small , independent meat market .	246.02557
my husband ' s hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a . m . to 7 p . m . the early part of the week , and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends .	45.753605
now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings -- and sundays , too , for this is coming .	105.486015
there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source , freezing it , and shipping it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required .	72.001686
if a customer wishes a special cut , it will not be available .	17.440546
we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged , whether we want it or not .	138.28998
most women , in this age of freezers , shop for the entire week on week-ends , when prices are lower .	125.03661

-- i , too , congratulate the american legion , of which i am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years , on the recent state convention .	46.23678

had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege , the matter she raised would have been clarified .	128.38162
the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag .	156.75471
judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this .	41.952602
the resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag .	44.762215
it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and , without an amendment to the law , we could not enforce this .	61.729282
my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises , and not by innuendo criticize them .	121.217674
at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties .	57.569107
-- the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children .	34.26587
in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children , the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field .	37.543774
the illinois commission for handicapped children , which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children , of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois , and of promoting more adequate services for them , indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children .	84.83431

( editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page ) .	63.926098
-- your july 26 editorial regarding the position of attorney general robert f . kennedy on prospective tax relief for dupont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact .	48.234188
as a result , your criticism of attorney general robert f . kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair .	13.823178
the editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on dupont stockholders , in connection with the united states supreme court ruling that dupont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings .	45.782215
these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that dupont stockholders might have to pay -- from an estimated 1 . 1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars .	55.00239
congressman wilbur d . mills , chairman of the house ways and means committee , asked the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law enforcement .	88.84012
the attorney general responded by letter dated july 19 .	9.136465
copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public .	80.640755
in this letter , mr . kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments .	150.72446
there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress , not the department of justice , to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation .	81.49948
yet your editorial said `` now the attorney general writes that no considerations ' justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' ' .	70.90065
what mr . kennedy , in fact , wrote was `` it is the department ' s view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' .	51.01439
the editorial , by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement , totally distorted mr . kennedy ' s views .	38.54497
the headline is offensive , particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial .	30.69572
-- i concur most heartily with today ' s letter on the futility of writing to sen . dirksen and sen . douglas .	51.567226

-- overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation ' s main industries .	40.16311
in covert socialism -- toward which america is moving -- private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them .	468.0865
in order to attract new industries , 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise .	167.75766
issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions .	129.54124
sir -- we are writing in reference to a recent `` suggestion ' ' made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ) .	74.172195
the day before election day , to which we are entitled as a legal holiday , we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party ' ' .	40.15557
being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we felt this wasn ' t a function of our position .	68.8945
as we understand , this directive was given to all city and county employes .	51.21664
to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation .	48.776737
we , therefore , considered the `` suggestion ' ' an insult to our intelligence , ethics , bill of rights , etc . .	38.533623
our only obligation for this day is to vote , free of persuasion , for the person we feel is capable in directing the public .	121.404625
this is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the united states .	43.590683
sir -- i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters .	128.37439
does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready to demand that `` the community ' ' help and protect them ? ?	41.413944
community shelters are , of course , necessary for those having no space for shelter .	123.07427
if in a town of 2 , 000 private homes , half of them have shelters , the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent .	81.35108
in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home ' s occupants , `` plus-one ' ' -- so he will be able to take in a stranger .	85.31722
i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart , will get busy and be the first member of our `` plus-one ' ' shelter club .	97.69422

sir -- when the colonies decided upon freedom from england , we insisted , through the declaration of independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity .	41.47727
it is high time the united states began to realize that the god-given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga .	118.12026
in the united nations charter , the right of self-determination is also an essential principle .	34.192776
the people of katanga had fought for , and obtained , their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga , and his cohorts .	68.38343
by political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they were justified in doing so .	78.03465
the united states and the u . n . denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the katangans .	41.285583
sir -- permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to .	106.64155
the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny .	117.464836
the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers .	131.98541
under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed	46.57607
the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate .	34.460243
this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college , and the director and two members of the board of freeholders .	18.0766
it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders , which `` shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed , levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes ' ' .	50.415474
the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college .	26.984602
since two of these could be trustees of the college , actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue .	56.760475
sir -- your editorial , `` housing speedup ' ' , is certainly not the answer to our slum problems .	26.696411
the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions .	47.004456
change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties .	79.62684
then see what a boom in all trades , as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers , will happen .	125.94381
our entire economy will have a terrific uplift .	9.886405
sir -- an old man is kicked to death by muggers .	55.292336
the medical examiner states that death was due to `` natural causes ' ' .	13.899128
i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york , it is listed as `` death due to natural causes ' ' .	55.528385
sir -- every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit `` our changing skyline in newark ' ' .	78.527626
it will be at the museum until march 30 .	7.446294
it is a revelation of what has been done , what is being done and what will be done in newark as shown by architects ' plans , models and pictures .	65.09781
it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud of this city .	170.06956
it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic , school and religious life of the community so that that phase of newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit .	109.24953
sir -- i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway .	37.911037
recently i traveled the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere .	94.11663
one even gave my little dog a biscuit .	9.042069
the viewers of the `` deep peep show ' ' at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp .	73.327286
twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encountered .	59.85809
this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing .	136.21489
the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay .	64.4481
some of the stumps are as much as three feet long , but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments .	36.520123
although the wood has been changed to coal , much of it still retains its original cell structure .	252.51044
in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time .	32.49941
these microfossils indicate the swamp was `` formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing .	59.042583
the 15th street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street reported in the washington post , august 2 , 1955 , which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger .	122.30618
recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air .	260.02063
while i respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that i would like to question .	77.42549
he said , `` let ' s work for peace instead of protection from aggression ' ' .	146.15396
i would ask , `` why not do both ' ' ? ?	13.618789
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people .	72.08149
are we not late , especially those of us who call ourselves friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding ? ?	118.74484
as to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone .	168.40839
is this a reason for saving no one ? ?	17.754227
would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone ? ?	124.66684
the speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face .	88.067085
if the world comes to this , wouldn ' t it be the very time when courage and american know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild ? ?	48.204987
many of our young people think it would .	226.61609
lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it `` civilian defense ' ' .	71.71704
in 1950 , public law 920 created civil defense ( different from civilian-groups of world war 2 ) , a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade .	57.616264
far from creating fear , as the speaker suggests , preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence .	94.28103
civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm , flood , accident or even war ? ?	76.74052
it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs .	109.55042
i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone ' s apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide .	72.82353
in addition , would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash ? ?	91.630844
i grant that the dog may not be really protective , based on his training , but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog ? ?	124.370445
i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments .	103.01488
use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe ? ?	18.559458
could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal ? ?	10.742937
is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists ' comfort ? ?	39.604717
perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended .	70.56522
the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak .	3.6818795
why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat ? ?	49.147476
unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season .	164.8645
as an added suggestion to balance the budget , the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument .	173.37825
it is visible throughout the city , and men from madison ave . would jump at the chance .	244.17407
sen . hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart .	39.324642
he , like most of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors .	77.53567
let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens .	87.12836
let us , like the french , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd .	112.01435
two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee ( may 2 ) by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work .	61.15108
for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity .	88.744896
the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations .	30.890385
recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations .	53.684036
president kennedy was right when he said , `` we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate ' ' .	39.18669
i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and the far east .	58.37044
it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war .	47.110252
the fact is that the italians , french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs .	61.000835
we have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war .	50.307896
we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin .	76.16499
it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us .	45.347473
but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany .	69.50842
soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation .	25.354675
in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated .	104.50174
the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism .	27.277761
berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse .	29.744682
actually , the communists , out of fear of a united and armed germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the u . n . .	51.646404
if the communists are sincere in wanting a united , neutral and disarmed germany , it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age .	73.759575
it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation .	98.23408
france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany .	13.210457
if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria .	152.55031
president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` operation survival ' ' which has many facets .	74.69663
why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states ? ?	60.756493
a united germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world .	38.5517
in your editorial of sept . 30 `` the smoldering congo ' ' you make the following comment `` far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments .	152.06981
it is up to the assembly to take action against them .	91.82811
they are violating their charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion ' ' .	61.01061
i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations	6.4725885
the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization .	47.566036
the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly .	32.155468
a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years ' ' .	50.743668
the u . s . s . r . and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget .	60.902916
but they refuse , as do the arab states , to support the united nations ' expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel , and the u . n . troops in the congo , which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations , but by a special budget .	28.891642
according to the official interpretation of the charter , a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the `` special ' ' united nations ' budgets , and of course cannot be expelled from the organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ) , due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion .	43.405502
connally amendment ' s repeal held step toward world order	1589.2819
in your sept . 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress you referred to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril ' ' .	80.09295
yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country ' s domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international court of justice .	31.76579
the connally amendment says that the united states , rather than the court , shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party .	41.20241
if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic , the court has no jurisdiction .	78.27319
since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states , it also prevents us from using the court effectively .	76.92175
yet although the kennedy administration , and the eisenhower administration before it , have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been taken .	84.57795
our `` destiny ' ' in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law .	87.12524
to achieve this destiny , acts as well as words are needed -- not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect .	202.88634
what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment -- an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court , enable us to utilize it , and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order ? ?	78.96467
we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment .	34.521904
many home-bound subway riders utilizing the flushing-main street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their express comes to a stop , leaving them stranded and strained .	131.39915
to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy-fourth street and change for the ind , this takes a daily toll of time and temper .	119.99388
the transit authority has recently placed in operation `` hold ' ' lights at bmt thirty-ninth and fifty-ninth street stations in brooklyn .	79.84044
this `` holds ' ' the local until the express passengers change trains .	702.402
without question , this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the woodside station .	36.529037
as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day .	67.971214
in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service .	79.81483
it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing .	94.09136
however , there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators .	63.6494
i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls , special long-distance calls , etc . .	25.897243
either it is lack of training , lack of proper screening when hiring , lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company , which does have a government-blessed monopoly .	77.134674
i disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled .	82.48384
the funeral for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price , far less than i had expected to pay .	79.52458
recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children .	13.945526
hazel park donates its recreation center , five days a week , to the school .	42.272823
there is no charge and no state aid .	7.713962
kiwanis , american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support .	79.37801
there are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school .	30.160604
reading , writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass .	84.78033
enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon .	38.24958
southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus ( the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ) .	144.42499
the school is located at 9-1/2 mile road , woodward heights .	23.016842
visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do .	131.54535
i was surprised at mayor miriani ' s defeat , but perhaps mayor-elect cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago .	67.33396
maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare , dpw and sanitation .	28.485842
negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great .	71.79814
he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night .	47.42225
there should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling .	116.36297
our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case .	80.3346
drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out .	34.309216
educate the city employes to give real service to the public .	7.8420568
after all , they are paid by the public , they should be examples .	122.41722
at a recent meeting of the women ' s association of the trumbull ave . united presbyterian church , considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible .	53.05986
some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the daily prayer and three minutes a day , as being very helpful .	82.602234
we feel that the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines .	108.1248
thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence .	75.91369
how old do you have to be to remember when americans , especially children , were encouraged to be polite ? ?	134.43472
why has this form of gentility gone out of american life ? ?	34.394608
how can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults are due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely ? ?	216.67735
writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern ' ' parents they have observed .	58.288227
from necessity , they are also inspired by the `` hard-sell ' ' attitude of the sponsor , so , finally , it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising .	54.776543
i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area .	32.27775
i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles .	221.55957
we have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city .	55.445625
maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost ' ' town .	81.81916
i worked on the schuylkill expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn ' t be an expressway .	71.28517
without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future .	68.01122
mr . george hough ( oct . 30 ) sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop .	86.39778
the trucks today help pay for this highway .	5.348119
they try to keep within the speed limits .	24.104155
although today ' s trucks are as fast as passenger cars , a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road .	60.85179
the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter `` simpleton ' ' instead of `` simplicitude ' ' .	54.347687
such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden .	332.56766
there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates , but not for the dropouts .	32.843773
what we need is more vocational training in high schools , not more dropouts .	42.12306
i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! !	81.97431
i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is .	166.8358
will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? ?	39.37489
if an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it .	85.35897
as i see it , if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back , the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary .	71.1622
why do we need bigger and better bombs ? ?	3.6489305
i repeat , two wrongs do not make a right .	38.859783
everyone should take time to read martin luther ' s hymn `` a mighty fortress is our god ' ' .	18.126923
to our everlasting shame , we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki .	51.0486
having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race .	40.51369
are we to be the master of the atom , or will the atom be our master -- and destroy us ! !	104.24339
just because cheddi jagan , new boss of british guiana , was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isn ' t a red .	46.5792
we have quite a few home-grown specimens of our own .	49.287712
if we go all gooey over this newest castro ( until he proves he isn ' t ) we ' ve got rocks in our heads .	81.24219
how many times must we get burned before we learn ? ?	40.01124
just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one .	148.18674
the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides .	94.35559
intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan , london or pearl harbor .	98.14831
that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war .	174.98495
russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world .	61.232166
why aren ' t the soviets expelled from the u . n . ? ?	7.2047043
while `` better late than never ' ' may have certain merits , the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation .	75.61557
had it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations was living , unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and , in many ways , thankless task .	69.05093
according to one report , however , mr . hammarskjold was considered `` too controversial ' ' a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring .	39.71243
actually , of course , that label `` controversial ' ' applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union .	91.15634
at khrushchev ' s door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated .	102.36397
it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed .	144.01642
as has happened so often in the past , the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy .	60.97277
just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a first-class example of `` people to people ' ' good will .	48.017548
if only this could be done more often -- with such heartening results -- many of the earth ' s `` big problems ' ' would shrink to the insignificances they really are .	87.775375
thanks for your good coverage of ahmad ' s visit , too ! !	41.216423
your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable	231.36388
one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea .	74.0929
we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice .	64.818115
they start on the east side of the schuylkill , have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination .	77.46014
bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings .	34.551163
each one of these is , by its nature , a focal point or a point of natural congestion .	36.221607
we should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep cars starting and ending on the east side of the river -- on the east side .	60.15886
this can be accomplished by several logical steps ( 1 )	18.275192
widen the east river drive at least one lane .	195.35976
so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems .	131.11469
paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges .	99.393745
one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent .	102.2465
this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive .	23.00385
i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square 1 .	68.57811
replace it with the statue of one or another of the world ' s famous dictators .	21.384394
there ' s no sense in being reminded of times that were .	215.10231
washington square seems not part of a free land .	82.185776
it may remind one of russia , china or east berlin	96.6374
but it can ' t remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for .	108.893105
the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals , because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square .	74.61964
the matter may seem a small thing to some people , i know , but it ' s a very good start on the road to totalitarianism the commission has posted signs in washington square saying	65.87958
the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square .	52.997314
does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance ? ?	362.3308
if birds don ' t belong in a square or park , what does ? ?	105.5708
they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature .	60.04634
but the commission does not share such sentiments .	11.108428
the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds .	52.999428
starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon , from city hall .	128.40427
if any are left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too .	113.569626
the city government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives .	23.494629
let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe , lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive .	105.26186
of course , in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we ' re afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say , `` how come ? ?	95.29258
who wants this deed done ' ' ? ?	1.0286542
-- in this small way do the leaders of a city , or of a nation , inure the masses to watching , or even inflicting , torture and death , upon even their fellow men .	51.5489
one means to help the birds occurs to me let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily , discontinue any piece of music but one .	223.87503
let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began , the hymn `` abide with me ' ' .	77.18839
we will know , and he will know , to whom it is rendered , what the birds would ask	96.769035
there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too `` soft ' ' .	29.548058
unfortunately , those who would remedy our `` softness ' ' seek to do so with calisthenics .	25.599485
they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy .	85.29583
it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft .	77.55593
ashamed of our wealth and power , afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace , we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies .	118.023705
when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation , when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no longer be `` soft ' ' .	63.65456
america doesn ' t need to `` push-up ' ' , she needs to stand up ! !	23.81313
the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals , is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit .	80.13481
however , he states unequivocally `` the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor ' ' .	43.51715
i must , in fairness , take issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals .	141.54242
the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with `` sweetheart contracts ' ' .	73.305786
these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes .	86.5586
a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute .	307.99203
anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders .	183.54013
further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrum-griffin act .	84.164894
the nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet .	79.612755
it is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories .	157.35323
they predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting .	31.380875
the biggest nuclear device the united states has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our b-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece .	91.169426
some time ago , however , mr . khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the soviet union would make them .	83.68284
he seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock .	113.78559
and now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side .	72.25334
khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ? ?	1.0408814
so be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing .	100.88428
so escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds .	159.9476
what is needed , philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun ( october 26 ) is a discontinuity .	38.599567
the escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon .	127.73331
`` only a discontinuity can end it ' ' , professor morrison writes .	20.092592
`` the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy ' ' .	79.66011
morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- europe of course must be written off out of hand .	54.929554
he feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take .	65.629
his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon , governor rockefeller , past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission , dr . edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war .	45.582172
these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security .	79.9621
capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation ' s security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .	89.35678
if this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation .	60.416866
he has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges .	105.44402
but if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously .	116.08614
not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere .	84.83968
khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps .	138.21536
when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural .	46.61514
thus , when the russians sent up their first sputnik , american chagrin was human enough , and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable .	134.74025
but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly .	39.41031
when east germans fled to the west by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of western publicists .	27.779814
they are less vocal now , when it is the west berliners who are migrating .	29.520805
the flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic .	129.46265
west berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable .	103.44282
nearly 18 per cent of west berlin ' s 2 , 200 , 000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12 . 8 per cent are under fifteen .	71.06769
r . h . s . crossman , m . p . , writing in the manchester guardian , states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1 , 700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1 , 900 a week .	70.30111
the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people .	136.67487
whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead .	178.59497
the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany , but the hard truth , says crossman , is that `` the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german , as distinct from russian , troops was a major communist victory , which dealt west berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow .	85.33695
the gallant half-city is dying on its feet ' ' .	3.739781
another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer ( london ) .	67.67743
mark arnold-foster writes `` people are leaving ( west berlin ) because they think it is dying .	34.1839
they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers ' federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months ' front-line work in factories in west berlin .	82.958115
berlin ' s resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed ' ' .	81.44062
the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city .	51.698257
state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort , will not avail .	113.35932
tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful .	96.30251
the materials for compromise are at hand the nation , walter lippmann and other sober commentators ( see alan clark on p . 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .	60.664146
a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save berlin .	101.82035
or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence , if that is what the west wants .	80.39423
the removal of stalin ' s body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history .	145.21248
it is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead .	22.683798
a british writer , richard haestier , in a book , dead men tell tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry 4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob .	89.168945
and in england , after the restoration , the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn .	41.111732
the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows .	26.096676
contemplating these posthumous punishments , stalin should not lose all hope .	102.20282
in 1899 , parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster , facing whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands .	95.78637
nikita khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself .	110.76727
the lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste .	72.95749
who will take stalin ' s place beside lenin ? ?	4.696754
there is karl marx , of course , buried in london .	134.886
the macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable .	40.005714
who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin ? ?	46.17799
since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people .	56.66086
besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life .	53.656498
suppose he did lie beside lenin , would it be permanent ? ?	56.060986
if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? ?	83.24251
when a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put .	72.95158
if nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand .	211.79532
the appointment of u thant of burma as the u . n . ' s acting secretary general -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .	59.81623
mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland were early favorites in the running , but france didn ' t like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter .	54.15476
with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr . hammarskjold , u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .	70.67854
what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy .	72.24321
in all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .	228.91748
he has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .	61.69232
he is a buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung .	42.415283
u thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when mr . hammarskjold ' s term would have come to an end .	24.181545
whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen .	197.5139
mr . khrushchev ' s demand for a troika is dormant , not dead	246.3061
the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents .	41.96646
in a sense , the showdown promised by mr . hammarskjold ' s sudden and tragic death has been avoided	25.90209
structurally , the u . n . is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it .	108.31398
but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong .	109.88667
no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .	105.3045
these are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it , as messrs . salsich and engh report on page 372 .	59.71603
even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ?	48.79685
) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading .	33.521442
friends , a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley , alabama .	60.326904
`` if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast ' ' , the account reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls .	108.575485
heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving civil defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute ' s notice ' ' .	94.01947
according to friends , the unit was organized by john snook , a former world war 2 , commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company .	43.272552
the girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck	44.961483
they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories .	23.653475
this may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy .	81.1555
the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .	164.0675
the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms	113.29097
a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined .	11.423461
as the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real .	119.38128
soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .	159.14763
all false gods resemble moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice .	43.922108
but there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands .	88.53584
the annual butchery of 40 , 000 american men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive	82.88122
a quota of 25 , 000 a year would be more than sufficient .	34.57064
no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace .	733.5803
if the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25 , 000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states .	63.40558
but by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily .	76.31772
yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical .	98.83228
here , then , is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning .	93.00133
from next new year ' s day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication .	110.36774
to avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse	94.67192
but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners .	136.10036
then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july 4 , 1963 .	69.414856
the scene , of course , should be nine miles northwest of centralia , illinois , the geographical center of population according to the census .	68.12632
a special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized .	71.32968
the band should play the rogues ' march as a processional , switching to `` hail columbia , happy land ' ' ! !	48.29223
independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it .	78.89691
the highway system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40 , 000 americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do .	59.781506
hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better .	67.94594
moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social .	202.16032
it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as it is generally termed , staying put .	106.80383
true , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , `` home-keeping hearts are happiest ' ' , is as disreputable as socinianism .	46.682083
nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists , which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith .	64.5938
perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia , robert ruark ' s grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is `` all this gallivantin ' ' ' .	39.086533
in any event , the yearly sacrifice of 40 , 000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith .	97.750046
somehow our contemporary moloch must be induced to see reason .	355.11978
since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example .	143.57683
if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25 , 000 per annum , then somebody is going to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson .	180.32742
to hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways	42.424892
so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected .	31.519747
as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race .	35.330173
but the guilt is shared by the united states , britain and france , the other members of the atomic club .	25.231487
until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 , the us and uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down .	97.46818
as it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body	97.358505
for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies .	63.270634
the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations .	86.639206
so , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr . khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat .	84.966774
shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions	704.9769
on october 19 , after the soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country , in `` self protection ' ' , might have to resume above-ground tests .	78.928444
more recently , the chairman of the atomic energy commission , dr . glenn t . seaborg , `` admitted ' ' to a news conference in las vegas , nevada , that the us might fall behind russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain .	82.579
all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood .	81.34949
but for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science ' s worst-marked channels , full of tricky currents and unknown depths .	71.60903
the scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the most vital points , at least publicly .	53.399723
on the one hand , the public health service declared as recently as october 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern ' ' or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the aj .	131.2791
but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states ' ' .	54.7831
then it added `` it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected ' ' .	92.82176
having hedged its bets in this way , phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all `` at present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected ' ' .	105.71175
then , to conclude on an indeterminate note `` nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world ' ' .	67.68014
dr . linus pauling , a nobel prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not .	79.30915
after declaring , in an article last month in frontier magazine , that the russian testing `` carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world ' ' , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled 200 megatons	52.077003
the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160 , 000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects .	84.57561
long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200 , 000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia .	134.23294
most of these would be in the northern hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating .	58.645805
pauling ' s estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility .	32.951736
the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn .	167.18246
but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem .	84.79387
its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .	281.07962
an illustration of this attitude is found in john a . mccone ' s letter to dr . thomas lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic .	70.60228
to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout .	130.40338
a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec ' s division of biology and medicine stated `` the question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered ' ' herein .	74.55277
of course , the aec is in a bind now .	337.7488
if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests .	70.17584
so the commission ' s announcements of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague .	47.10594
now , of course , that the russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid , when the us was testing in the atmosphere .	67.02312
the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold .	101.44075
after a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof .	77.07725
yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout , it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count .	105.11867
as of october 25 , the aec had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of tnt )	49.61473
and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported .	37.839138
assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons .	106.93832
some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated .	131.9615
if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far .	93.05128
to this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in november , 1958 .	30.99668
one of the inescapable realities of the cold war is that it has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas .	75.584526
the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself .	17.74245
that dilemma is as much with us as ever .	99.44389
the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests .	53.954613
when this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late ' 50 ' s -- the united states appeared to have three choices .	85.079765
it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations .	24.327543
it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination .	53.97436
or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security .	165.9581
with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken .	84.89205
once again , the united states must choose .	70.36778
and once again , the choices are much the same .	28.118662
only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .	71.32441
the first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the russians .	52.69812
the second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere .	89.26058
the third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as russian behavior demonstrates , a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable .	70.832726
we take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us .	104.073
it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable .	247.39725
its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice	175.74104
one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience .	88.857185
leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice .	78.98432
for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now proposing .	71.87494
in particular , governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests .	35.435932
speaking recently in miami , governor rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests ' ' .	36.61498
taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the united states is `` to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right ' ' .	49.343407
what was missing in the governor ' s argument , as in so many similar arguments , was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right .	95.369225
the possibility , as he asserted , that the russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand .	127.20007
besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governor ' s case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary .	93.20577
recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have , to the contrary , assured us that our lead is very great .	55.133472
unless the administration and the defense department have been deceiving us , the facts do not support the assertion that we are `` compelled ' ' to resume atmospheric testing .	30.874865
it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in the future , be necessary and even justifiable .	46.808422
but a resumption does not seem justifiable now .	21.00183
what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations .	95.220955
we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake .	80.53204
this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism .	121.1626
too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part .	85.31014
there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does .	118.17693
the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start .	26.775606
when his holiness pope john 23 , first called for an ecumenical council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for christian unity , the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate .	72.023186
with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom .	109.28662
but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides .	76.66839
the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church .	56.335953
as it has turned out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses .	122.63035
two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy .	282.09982
first of all , it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity .	74.910576
far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the pontiff believes that a revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light .	70.96099
equally significant , pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity .	304.97568
a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity .	64.065285
secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church .	86.374916
the establishment , by the holy father , of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern .	58.21284
the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches assembly in new delhi as `` official ' ' observers reverses the church ' s earlier stand .	68.498795
the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state , cardinal cicognani , for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act .	70.3752
nor can one forget pope john ' s unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury .	59.80069
augustin cardinal bea , the director of the secretariate for christian unity , has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the church ' s stance toward the protestant and orthodox churches .	53.05823
noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone .	66.59442
for discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts , `` would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of god , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit ' ' .	79.07152
can any christian fail to respond to these words ? ?	25.604717
the administration ' s official budget review , which estimates a 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year , isn ' t making anyone happy .	61.522346
certainly it isn ' t making the president happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year .	97.6986
we sympathize with mr . kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn ' t please us either , although for very different reasons .	104.43962
furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring .	253.98683
in the first place , a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhower ' s estimate of a 1 . 5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing president ' s farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor .	31.26788
the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received .	83.74291
the rest of the deficit is also easily understood .	21.642662
four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense , an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration , quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere .	91.91753
four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglected by mr . eisenhower .	121.87735
the farm program will cost an additional 1 . 5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the food for peace program and other new measures .	69.58201
anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit .	43.008114
our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures .	111.56504
and yet mr . kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up ' ' and `` economizing ' ' .	33.77096
we wish the president would remember that `` fiscal responsibility ' ' was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election .	56.395947
the party that won used to say something about a new frontier .	23.061443
introduction of the `` dialogue ' ' principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october .	93.5058
two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants , and when the speaker was a catholic , one `` discussant ' ' on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion .	54.36705
sessions devoted to `` ethics and foreign policy trends ' ' , `` moral principle and political judgment ' ' , `` christian ethics in the cold war ' ' and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves .	91.01952
usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker or discussion leader .	180.77052
in the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law , which dr . william v . o ' brien of georgetown university , advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy .	55.792465
that aristotelean-thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants , but in the end the concept came to reassert itself .	50.260807
speakers declared that protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name .	69.1382
a lebanese moslem told about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the `` divine law ' ' , while a c . a . i . p . member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new u . n . nations told of its widespread recognition on the african continent .	63.40909
the impression was unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence .	98.21175
another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself .	43.6176
the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable .	243.49112
it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other ' s positions and better comprehension of one ' s own .	67.2382
but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed , and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues .	159.21548
one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical ' ' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend berlin , for example	81.50659
the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account	146.16699
it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative .	70.32485
everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question .	36.771156
i was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy .	132.42297
i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts .	232.05031
but i questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian ' s dreamy irredentism .	14.50542
their answer was it can be done , and we will do it .	25.547386
and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang kai-shek `` in america ' ' , i said , `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland .	50.87843
what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done ' ' ? ?	41.021324
( he always smiles -- at least at visitors , i gather .	338.08698
he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions .	72.11332
i recalled sympathetically the duke ' s complaint in browning ' s `` my last duchess ' ' .	20.501001
) he smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , `` the president wonders where you are going after you leave taipei ' ' ? ?	52.276314
that , i smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one .	77.77547
i answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly .	127.047195
chiang spoke again , this time at greater length .	24.003218
`` the president says ' ' , the translator came in , `` that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question .	126.81823
he says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant .	74.35985
so you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions .	51.924274
any information we have here in taiwan is at your disposal ' ' .	12.197959
for every person on taiwan , there are sixty in mainland china .	302.74808
if the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think of liberation , as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia .	86.04684
less than 60-1 , but at least 6-1 .	28.907564
the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army .	47.54751
the armed forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about 450 , 000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated .	174.05219
it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia , and the army the best trained .	86.72555
even so , it adds up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight ? ?	136.49767
the miserable people of china , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play , cannot themselves resist overtly .	250.65366
they think , perforce , of physical survival everything else is secondary .	288.21008
but the army which mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies ? ?	127.70067
the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in china over thousands of years .	105.9005
it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist depersonalization .	14.383167
every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation .	72.93989
the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? ?	156.37315
the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed a despot does not economize on his generals .	82.453835
but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews .	53.92402
to whom will the generals stay loyal ? ?	1.1299721
there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in place of ideological purity out on the farm .	115.4441
it is another question whether `` they ' ' -- or a single general , off in a corner of china , secure for a few ( galvanizing ? ?	63.885998
) days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the party .	92.66654
but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there .	32.03721
the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .	70.23155
the first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .	138.62933
and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .	125.384384
for it is the family that , in china , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .	79.51226
but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .	55.117966
thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .	64.01768
tibet has historically served china as a buffer state .	80.489204
a friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile .	124.424484
china never tried to integrate tibet by extirpating the people ' s religion and institutions .	32.01922
red china is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed .	68.25544
tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult .	27.03982
tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleeding france .	97.120544
these continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension .	96.455505
the imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from the outside , might cause it to snap .	100.27351
the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men .	33.23819
they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control .	183.74942
first and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime .	12.041038
secondly , they depend on america ' s `` moral cooperation ' ' when the crucial moment arrives .	70.8607
they hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly .	85.703964
i remarked jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day .	143.31212
he affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point .	986.96844
but he -- and all of china -- wears the scars of american indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are .	78.45248
we have been grand to formosa itself -- lots of aid , and , most of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands .	60.45609
but our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive .	71.50942
a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr . kennedy ' s views on the world struggle .	17.9301
the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike .	44.483593
there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation .	202.96608
the moment of truth is the moment of crisis .	62.7177
during the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures .	82.294914
there the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look .	49.42643
new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones .	43.47311
a truth-revealing crisis erupted in katanga for a couple of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies .	81.73552
before memory , too , clouds over , let us make a note or two of what could be seen .	53.537277
the measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels .	125.40819
one knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine .	158.95494
but i am here concerned more with policy than with men .	67.76843
public men come and go but great issues of policy remain .	566.8234
now , everyone knows -- or knew in the week of december 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy .	105.89171
the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved .	74.69265
of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations .	6.059279
but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the u . s . was in reality the principal .	38.270386
the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies , to the entire western community .	57.85186
by our policy the west was -- is -- split .	185.8469
the controlling pattern was first displayed in the hungary-suez crisis of november 1956 .	203.37442
it reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality in cuba last spring ( with which the dominican events of last month should be paired )	180.73657
at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles	123.8333
in relation to laos , algeria , south africa	9.597056
right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana .	30.038643
this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows under prevailing policy , the u . s . can take the initiative against the right , but cannot take the initiative against the left .	48.068394
it makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue .	129.35403
the u . s . cannot take the initiative against the left .	54.195343
there is even some question whether the u . s . can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left .	70.90538
we can attack tshombe , but not gigenza .	19.752968
no matter that gizenga is moscow ' s man in the congo .	48.415836
no matter that it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men .	306.4933
no matter that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western interests in africa .	36.76073
( even granted that the congo should be unified , you don ' t protect western security by first removing the pro-western weight from the power equilibrium .	116.18582
we can force britain and france out of the suez , but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest .	98.14152
we can mass our fleet against the trujillos , but not against the castros .	60.217434
we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall -- much less , give the simple order to push the wall down .	96.624626
we officially receive the anti-french , moscow-allied algerian fln , but we denounce the pro-europe , anti-communist oas as criminal .	41.131428
in the very week of our war against katanga , we make a $133 million grant to kwame nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship .	66.562355
as our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-western katangans , we stand supinely bleating while nehru ' s troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato ally , portugal .	59.349354
it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy .	164.31647
the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration , but only made more consistent and more active .	73.2357
most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa , katanga and ghana , as to the suez-hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of asia , africa and latin america .	43.790493
from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted ' ' ( `` neutralist ' ' , `` contested ' ' ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- nehru , tito , nkrumah , sukarno , betancourt , etc . .	29.980621
our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes .	225.44302
if we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible .	219.25436
and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left .	44.25964
to write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it .	101.74202
nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else ' s book .	77.287094
to get started , he does not scan the world about him	107.13998
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists .	176.29912
so far this season , broadway ' s premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original american stage plays .	207.0771
of straight dramas , there are all the way home , which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel , a death in the family	54.465885
the wall , awkwardly based on the john hersey novel	28.266495
advise and consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller	52.131565
face of a hero ( closed ) , based on a pierre boulle novel .	41.019936
the only original works attempting to reach any stature tennessee williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , period of adjustment , and arthur laurents ' clever but empty invitation to a march .	174.60172
clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- a taste of honey , by britain ' s young ( 19 when she wrote it ) shelagh delaney	90.637054
the hostage ( closed ) , by ireland ' s brendan behan .	7.548551
among the musicals , camelot came from t . h . white ' s the once and future king , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do re mi .	93.38179
wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce .	93.65323
the only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- send me no flowers ( closed ) , under the yum-yum tree , critic ' s choice .	67.3018
in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival , broadway is not even adapting books , but reconverting old movies ( hail the conquering hero and lili ) .	82.11934
originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad .	55.420486
some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably life with father and diary of anne frank .	195.6882
and particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from die fledermaus and the merry widow to oklahoma ! and my fair lady .	144.0228
as critic walter kerr points out `` adaptations , so long as they are good , still qualify as creative ' ' .	92.940636
and other defenders invariably argue that , after all , shakespeare and moliere were adapters too .	104.67979
the difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world	96.02047
most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own stage technique .	108.0444
the most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers cannot afford to take chances .	241.04933
off-broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original .	151.98862
laudably enough , it is offering classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one u . s . original was on the boards , robert d . hock ' s stunning civil war work , borak .	73.33631
the real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of u . s . playwrights .	33.69929
he `` come with me to the casbah ' ' .	2.208383

that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan , as more and more new yorkers were discovering 29th street and eighth avenue , where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like arabian nights , grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american inpost of belly dancing .	75.584854
their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis .	97.48821
the belly boites , with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek and turkish families .	54.267467

but a great many of what variety calls the `` cooch terpers ' ' are considerably less cosmic than that .	48.164368
each dancer follows the ancient oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room .	44.873795
this is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) .	76.95701
the new york dancers are highly eclectic , varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls .	144.07185
the belly dance leaves more to the imagination .	7.005647
when a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers ' costumes .	87.13567
with tips , the girls average between $150 and $200 a week , depending on basic salary .	69.148254
although they are forbidden to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks , and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy .	99.528336
all over the country , belly clubs have never been bigger , especially in detroit , boston and chicago , and even in small towns	64.741165
one of the best dancers , a turkish girl named semra , works at a roadhouse outside bristol , conn . .	49.997295
the girls are kept booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded murat somay , a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central abdomen .	27.278782
he can offer nine turkish girls , plans to import at least 15 more .	61.69394
but a great many of the dancers are more or less native .	83.52796
sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conducted by lebanese and syrians in the u . s . , where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs .	48.77886
as the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins , the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly .	67.9825
jemela ( surname gerby ) , 23 , seems hong kong oriental but has a spanish father and an indian mother , was born in america and educated at holy cross academy and textile high school , says she learned belly dancing at family picnics .	106.01139
serene ( mrs . wilson ) , 23 , was born in budapest and raised in manhattan .	40.351604
daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance , she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the new york casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body .	36.638565
many belly dancers are married , but serene is one of the few who will admit it .	45.315144
marlene ( surname adamo ) , 25 , a brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from arabic friends in paris , now lives on manhattan ' s west side , is about the best belly dancer working the casbah , loves it so much that she dances on her day off .	98.76152
she has the small , highly developed body of a prime athlete , and holds in contempt the `` girls who just move sex ' ' .	113.74003
leila ( malia phillips ) , 25 , is a greenwich village painter of persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles .	124.84513
a graduate of hollywood high school , she likes to imagine herself , as she takes the floor , `` a village girl coming in to a festival ' ' .	68.20686
gloria ( surname ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who was born in italy and once did `` chorus work ' ' in toronto , has been around longer than most of the others , wistfully remembers the old days when `` we used to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all .	66.65485

of the handful of painters that austria has produced in the 20th century , only one , oskar kokoschka , is widely known in the u . s . .	24.915085
this state of unawareness may not last much longer .	70.48606
for ten years a small group of european and u . s . critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten austrian expressionist egon schiele , who died 42 years ago at the age of 28 .	25.055685
the critics ' campaign finally inspired the first major u . s . exhibit of schiele ' s works .	37.67018
the show has been to boston and manhattan , will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis .	188.46048
last week it opened at the j . b . speed museum in louisville , at the very moment that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau gallery in los angeles .	45.440525
schiele ' s paintings are anything but pleasant .	2.417675
his people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened .	41.508766
his colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom .	58.287617
but he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination .	88.46162
the son of a railway stationmaster , schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town of tulln , 14 miles northwest of vienna .	48.34883
he was an emotional , lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork .	121.97369
when he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna .	30.14019
even there he did not last for long .	6.1488533
cried one professor after a few months of student schiele ' s tantrums and rebellion `` the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ' ' ! !	96.93816
for a while his work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of gustav klimt , then the dean of austrian art .	43.855667
gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter .	112.72016
his pictures were roundly denounced as `` the most disgusting things one has ever seen in vienna ' ' .	65.64427
he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle .	71.23849
for years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in vienna ' s gutters .	37.49051
drafted into the austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a vienna billet , went on painting .	64.63845
it was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show .	37.970356
the unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too much even for morbid-minded vienna .	110.71352
he was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust .	50.641354
the children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness , and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic .	39.441338
the subject he liked most was the female body , which he painted in every state -- naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sitting primly in a chair , lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace .	55.35567
the most surprising thing about the twenty-second congress of the soviet communist party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the twentieth congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous `` secret ' ' report on stalin .	56.42147
the publication last july of the party ' s draft program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism ' ' -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i . e . , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group ' ' ) in all theoretical party journals .	53.75443
these never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of marx and lenin `` full communism ' ' was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a communist society had now , under khrushchev , become an `` immediate and tangible reality ' ' .	67.20454
it seems that khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to marxist doctrine with his draft program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) .	126.60977
he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` all people ' s state ' ' , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization ' ' of the whole hierarchy of soviets , starting with the supreme soviet itself .	77.99053
their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy ' ' and would enable `` the people ' ' to take a more direct and active part in running the country .	56.416954
there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from .	151.6658
no doubt , there was still a lot in the draft program -- and in khrushchev ' s speech -- which left many points obscure .	100.56911
was it the party ' s intention , for example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes , i . e . , state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively `` urbanized ' ' ) ? ?	44.732452
as we know , the soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot	146.57474
and it is still very far from certain how valid the party ' s claim is that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes ' ' the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm .	95.850655
if one follows the reports of the congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter .	57.375385
the draft program was interesting in other respects , too .	44.677197
it contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays	73.87366
they still benefit far less than the `` other ' ' 50 per cent of the nation from that `` welfare state ' ' which the soviet union so greatly prides itself on being .	58.51968
over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly	190.43973
and , though he repeated , over and over again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the `` ordinary ' ' people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how `` communism ' ' is really going to work in practice , especially in respect of food .	72.3957
would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry ? ?	1.0316048
this was something on which k . himself seemed to have some doubts	90.744514
for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears ' ' of those responsible for agricultural production .	82.06145
and , as we know , the virgin lands are not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped .	133.78845
one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev ' s agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group ' ' -- molotov , malenkov , kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old marshal voroshilov .	43.877422
molotov , in particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services , to increase rents and fares	73.55951
in fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the khrushchev `` welfare state ' ' .	49.804077
the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story what , in the secret councils of the kremlin , molotov had really proposed , we just don ' t know , and he has had no chance to reply .	63.232185
but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party ' ' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism ' ' and , last but not least , on foreign policy .	81.44077
the whole problem of `` peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition ' ' with the capitalist world is in the very center of this congress .	38.195213
`` molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence , reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war .	61.006096
his views , in fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look upon it merely as a variant of the `` cold war ' ' or of an `` armed peace ' ' .	45.44369
one cannot help wondering whether molotov and the rest of the `` anti-party group ' ' are not being used as china ' s whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers .	42.3853
for something , clearly , has gone very , very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese relations , which were never easy , and have now deteriorated .	145.50824
the effect of chou en-lai ' s clash with khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on molotov & co . , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the soviet people , from the `` epoch-making ' ' twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese conflict .	56.928833
not only , as we know , did chou en-lai publicly treat khrushchev ' s attack on albania as `` something that we cannot consider as a serious marxist-leninist approach ' ' to the problem ( i . e . , as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic ' ' ) , but the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and so on .	51.17449
it is extremely doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends .	181.94308
the big question is whether , in the name of a restored chinese-soviet solidarity , the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians to present their humble apologies to khrushchev -- or get rid of enver hoxa .	88.47925
these seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident ' ' can now be closed .	37.22134
but albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between china and russia .	70.50959
khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence ' ' and would like , above all , the berlin and german problems to be settled peacefully	81.166954
he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the russo-american `` honeymoon ' ' of 1959 .	33.26834
but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from china , but perhaps also from that `` china lobby ' ' which , i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago , exists on the quiet inside the party .	107.96051
to these people , solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russia ' s future policy .	38.754017
and the chinese , as the albanian incident shows , have strong suspicions that khrushchev is anxious to secure a `` shameful ' ' peace with the west .	54.318638
the fact that china ( which is obsessed by formosa -- to khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by north korea and north vietnam is highly indicative .	91.225006
and one cannot but wonder whether marshal malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the west , wasn ' t trying to keep the chinese quiet .	76.56982
and this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb .	185.90361
was not this dropped primarily in order to `` appease ' ' the chinese -- especially after `` khrushchev ' s `` humiliating ' ' surrender to the west in canceling the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31 ? ?	60.738533
what does it all add up to ? ?	1.0569772
indications are that khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of berlin ) the maintenance of the status quo in the world .	50.353676
the chinese , north vietnamese and north koreans , on the other hand , feel that , militarily , russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation ' ' they would like to embark on before long with china attacking formosa and the north koreans and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries .	53.053032
perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the `` anti-party group ' ' nearly liquidated him .	58.208286
he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition	100.88755
but if he is up against china ' s crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life .	38.030987
he may support china ( but he won ' t )	4.589465
he may break with china ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuading china to be patient .	141.61757
the next days may show where things stand .	12.230901
on a misty sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-communists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here .	72.70931
eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare .	67.33804
to the average american , this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie .	148.38782
but to the minutemen , this is a serious business .	155.90448
they feel that the united states is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy .	67.58958
they feel that world war 3 , has already begun , and they are setting themselves up as a `` last line of defense ' ' against the communist advance .	79.757256
their national leader , robert bolivar depugh of norborne , mo . , says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the red onslaught .	57.88398
in their maneuvers last month , they wore world war 2 , camouflage garb and helmets , and carried unloaded m-1 rifles .	35.777607
the maneuvers were held `` in secret ' ' after a regional seminar for the minutemen , held in nearby shiloh , ill . , had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs , who had arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville , ill . , and seized four operative weapons , including a browning machine gun , two browning automatic rifles and an m-4 rifle .	59.247845
undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli ' s home at 6 30 a . m . the next day , put on their uniforms , and headed for a farm several miles away .	35.67786
a 60 mm . mortar and a 57 mm . recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along .	29.085728
the mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated .	7.6227317
after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war 2 , army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully .	70.75488
here the two leaders , depugh and lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces .	82.33091
the minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment .	179.73216
they were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge .	30.877249
they practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades	100.963684
and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment .	22.76536
eleven dummy rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting .	70.51501
mrs . depugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband ' s organization , participated in all the exercises .	41.67375
there were no `` casualties ' ' , but the `` guerrillas ' ' admitted to being `` a little tired ' ' when the leaders called a halt at 9 a . m . to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane .	58.04758
i would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by russell kirk ( dec . 16 ) .	77.9218
it has to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure .	25.209063
next september , after receiving a degree from yale ' s master of arts in teaching program , i will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers .	106.928825
the amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers .	56.73312
as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers .	81.70797
the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality .	70.80578
hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary .	58.532494
i am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country , the profession is grossly overpaid .	40.03826
it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases	396.72015
there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance .	109.83098
the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them .	226.88695
the only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure .	91.929756
here , as in all sectors of the economy , quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses .	85.033844
on the eve of the `` great debate ' ' on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the atlantic community , we should face the alternatives on this proposition .	44.1803
what we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate .	115.593704
without this power we lay open any american industry which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others .	113.41068
it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs .	60.146755
i disagree with mr . burnham ' s position on the common market ( nov . 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join .	70.74402
for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of this kind is difficult to understand .	61.86117
the pressure for our entry to the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare ' ' , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background .	102.33459
the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal , as well as economic , self-rule .	61.177998
in entering this union we will be surrendering most , if not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the atlantic institute ( recently set up ) or the o . e . c . d . , i . m . f . and others .	51.58015
to think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking .	130.93918
if it is not enough that all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join this market , i refer you to an article in the new york times ' magazine section ( nov . 12 , 1961 ) , by mr . eric johnston , entitled `` we must join the common market ' ' .	49.96964
he says `` it has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs ' ' .	17.523262
referring to britain , he says , `` we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy , placing this authority in continental hands ' ' .	143.6136
since the goal of our international planners is a world government , this atlantic community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once american economic autonomy is absorbed , a larger grouping is a question of time .	151.25537
frankly , it is being very cleverly done for , in a sense , they have us over a barrel .	95.995834
listen to what mr . johnston has to say `` consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict .	106.657616
we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need .	154.15846
we would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment ' ' .	34.2095
but the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community or `` economic empire ' ' , but merely what libertarians like henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry .	66.19017
create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we ' ll compete with anyone , europe and asia combined .	107.47436
in short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won ' t have to worry about european competition or communism either .	63.815025
if we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it	26.199596
if we go into this common market , we might just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees , connally amendments or , for that matter , conservatism in general .	144.47333
we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the atlantic common market which jnr will be continuing in our pages .	95.46122
the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning , november 27 , anticipating by two days the announcement of the u . s . treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed .	62.79344
in 1954 i was drafted and after serving two years honorably on active duty i was not required to participate in any further army reserve activities .	134.14702
now , more than five years later , i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier .	181.47363
but , in spite of this , i , at present a man 31 years of age and a college professor , have been recalled `` by direction of the president ' ' to report on november 25th to fort devens , massachusetts , for another twelve months of active duty as an sp 4 ( the equivalent of a pfc ) .	60.52309
today , seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee , i am assistant professor of philosophy and science at st . michael ' s college .	40.472965
for , after leaving the army in 1956 , i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college and then at the university of toronto .	50.286434
this time , added to that which i had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 , makes a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education .	86.204865
the possibility of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys .	124.63541
however , it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably , equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes ' ' .	128.97575
in my own case , i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking .	78.879234
taken back into the army now as an sp 4 , i am leaving 110 college students whose teacher i am .	96.08248
( a wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes .	84.61579
) at this late date , it is impossible for st . michael ' s college to find a suitable replacement for me .	81.75049
even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- i cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone mad .	98.070366
in news broadcasts i consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army referred to as mercenaries .	127.61655
if the hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for england in the 1770 ' s were mercenaries , what shall we call the un troops sent to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the united nations ? ?	44.523098
if the un troops are not mercenaries then the hessians were not mercenaries either .	81.90965
and if the foreigners fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette and von steuben were mercenaries too , as were also the members of the lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 , and of chennault ' s flying tigers in the early days of world war 2 .	34.907528
it doesn ' t take a gore vidal to tell you what ' s wrong with cherokee textile ' s slogan ( pitney-bowes objects ' ' , july 1 ) .	45.208958
it ' s an eighteenth-century negative , man ! !	59.25802
suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment by moving the term `` republic ' ' to lower case , substituting the modern phrase , `` move ahead ' ' for the stodgy `` keep ' ' , and by using the postmaster ' s name on every envelope ( in caps , of course , with the `` in spite ' ' as faded as possible ) , the slogan cannot fail .	65.263596
in the issue of march 5 , 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said	170.99788
`` on trial in jakarta for having flown for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents , u . s . pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters , he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of indonesia .	59.140106
facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty , he said ' i have participated in the war against communism in korea and at dienbienphu , and i have helped in the evacuation of north vietnamese to the free world .	41.10249
i have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by communist domination .	66.67678
at least in indonesia , khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with communism ' ' ! !	117.69067
since then nothing has happened to save the life of pope .	33.35274
i found recently a very small article in the new york times	5.9956493
indonesia court upholds pope ' s death sentence .	8.33299
-- indonesia military supreme court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence pope , an american pilot .	147.66568
pope was convicted last year of having aided north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions .	45.90102
he has been in prison since may , 1958 , when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas .	64.149315
he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency ' ' .	4.9417596
as we see , pope may appeal to president sukarno , khrushchev ' s friend , for clemency .	35.69705
the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban freedom fighters .	45.33555
but who will act now and immediately to save the life of alan pope ? ?	42.266384
does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-communist american pilot ? ?	109.57978
a few days before i saw your mention of what texas liberals were doing to promote `` louis capet ' ' ( the week ' ' , june 3 ) , another analogy had occurred to me .	56.93874
`` with no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he was the government ' ' .	49.380867
`` a ' dust-settling ' period of decadence and decline ' ' .	30.32269
`` he opened his mouth , said little , and thought not at all ' ' .	36.772266
`` not completely virtuous , but completely incompetent ' ' .	1.9928354
truly , that liberals should choose louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic , considering the louis 14 , character of their grand monarque , fdr not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies .	45.040565
in defeating `` louis capet ' ' , john tower ' s victory in texas signals , once again , the end of the divine right of liberalism .	102.03298
it seems to me that n . c . , in his editorial `` confrontation ' ' ( sr , mar . 25 ) , has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer ? ?	33.716515
this affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress .	66.96099
i know of no other solution than the one n . c . proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place .	119.498604
never have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically .	151.7066
thank you for the illustrated editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	1.7283522
it is both great writing and profound religion .	2.7779195
n . c . has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece .	170.90617
i feel that n . c . hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	42.713554
my only hope is that it will be shared by many , many others .	93.27174
`` confrontation ' ' should fortify us all , whether in southeast asia or the u . s . .	29.75442
congratulations to n . c . for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the peace corps .	41.67873
i concur that it is necessary for americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands .	113.65279
it would be heartbreaking to see idealism , and hence effective leadership , thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into .	131.4439
the editorial `` confrontation ' ' was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in america .	88.1043
thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world .	147.393
n . c . ' s editorial `` confrontation ' ' is a stunning piece of writing .	17.962736
i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone entering the peace corps to read it .	60.03034
the important people to humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros but the schweitzers and the dooleys , and the others like them whose names we will never know .	67.031265
editor ' s note reprints of `` confrontation ' ' will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the peace corps .	23.08785
a peace corps official described the editorial as `` precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers ' ' .	29.291306
f . l . lucas ' s article in sr ' s april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new english bible .	30.34631
i certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers , rather than the comment by cleveland amory in his first of the month column .	66.21815
it is blind , fundamentalist dogmatism to say , `` messing around with the king james version seems to us a perilous sport at best ' ' .	51.613945
lester markel is on the right track in his article `` interpretation of interpretation ' ' ( sr , mar . 11 ) .	13.369973
the current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact , fancy , and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago .	120.211914
we don ' t need this type of protection any more .	241.80267
the public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media .	776.0617
besides , there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about .	43.755306
the accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities .	10.246469
a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for instance , is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute .	57.278942
second , it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous .	35.87095
the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation .	308.73428
yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns .	204.99667
despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating .	109.32993
the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions .	73.61653
it seems to me the time has come for the american press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends .	82.042786
the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors .	84.1476
i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president kennedy ' s activities , so far as southern california is concerned .	86.705
you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions .	80.117775
to begin with , the all-powerful los angeles times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences .	93.07808
i am sure that they did when eisenhower was president .	45.584976
next , because of the time differential , the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day .	51.19348
up until now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 p . m . or sometimes 7 or 10 30 p . m . .	29.25366
even then , a few of the `` less interesting ' ' questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator .	60.92586
however , last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into their programs .	143.79547
this is no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary .	174.6397
the radio stations did run `` transcripts ' ' ( i thought ) during the evening hours .	41.24959
however , by comparing the tv snatches , two different radio station re-runs , and the censored los angeles times version , i found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( abc removed the one regarding laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president ' s answer .	87.33954
i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the `` abuse ' ' he is being subjected to .	46.97153
we out here don ' t see enough of the conference to know he is being abused .	63.758327
i don ' t know if this is the situation in other parts of the country	34.0415
it also happened with the inauguration , which was not re-run at all during the evening hours , and i wrote to the tv editor of the times .	51.969273
he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations ' not doing this -- but nothing happened .	105.36145
can you bring the networks ' attention to this ? ?	21.842222
i was interested in james webb young ' s madison avenue column in which he raised the question `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	62.79245
and the sad part of it is that we had one , which was rounding into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die .	85.16499
during the war , we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black and white and the various shades of grey in between .	91.82938
we had a couple of schools in this country , the principal one being on the marshall field estate out in lloyd ' s neck .	110.05053
there were also a couple in canada , and several in england .	123.69515
the english schools preceded ours , and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching .	67.154625
four of us here in the united states attended , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in england , canada , and the united states .	65.186714
we set up the lloyd ' s neck school , worked out its curriculum , and taught there .	135.73729
toward the end of the war , we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it .	73.94502
when the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust .	81.06264
we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so .	207.59517
there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare .	18.6853
a study at the pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there .	80.368546
and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way .	70.49164
congratulations on the article `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	25.106178
this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years , and i certainly hope it sparks some action .	111.912384
many of us in public relations were flattered that richard l . tobin chose to devote his editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger of the public relations society of america and the american public relations association .	43.593704
i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published .	94.161285
whether in his forthcoming book c . p . snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important .	91.07662
one should be able to get hold of the book at once .	69.42158
but the attack was made from an advance copy .	33.502373
if this practice should take root and spread , the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality .	94.53271
editor ' s note sir robert watson-watt wrote , on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961	297.8571
`` i have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled , ' science and government .	138.72409
until the work actually appears i am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail .	59.962105
but i have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin lectures at harvard , from which the book was derived , and i can with confidence challenge the gist of c . p . snow ' s incautious tale ' ' .	51.830475
watson-watt ' s remarks in sr did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures .	56.36105
representatives of harvard university press , which is publishing the book this month of april , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book ' s publication date .	143.47882
the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt .	26.95789
sir robert watson-watt ' s `` rebuttal ' ' of sir charles snow ' s godkin lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself from sir charles ' supposed falsehoods while stating those `` falsehoods ' ' in an unclear incoherent argument .	86.375656
the article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning .	39.33194
it calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike ' ' a `` perverted conclusion .	67.16888
it submits an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing another aspect of the man , but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles ' account .	90.81962
we are left to choose between the two lindemanns .	67.766975
the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party .	32.474274
but we are to believe that lindemann actively supported radar outside the tizard committee , and dissembling , discounted it inside ? ?	101.66747
if so , i would lean to sir charles ' conception of the man .	18.237585
i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time .	65.46344
to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it .	64.79991
it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the violin .	26.26861
certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless recitals , and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the chicago symphony orchestra , playing the brahms concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed .	48.332466
there was about that song something incandescent , for this brahms was milstein at white heat .	254.38124
not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent .	82.51996
those would be reserved for the orchestra ' s great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .	76.18846
this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood .	104.06401
but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .	90.175186
that is , when mr . milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , mr . hendl could go along .	59.38692
but mr . hendl does not go straight to any point .	22.263294
there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion .	138.02094
so we had some dazzling and memorable milstein , but not great brahms .	61.55451
the concert opened with another big romantic score , schumann ' s overture to `` manfred ' ' , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic point to keep it afloat .	52.46561
hindemith ' s joust with weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands transluscent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit .	43.917362
it got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style .	188.23657
the bayreuth festival opens july 23 with a new production of `` tannhaeuser ' ' staged by wieland wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch .	44.016266
sawalisch also conducts `` the flying dutch ' ' , opening july 24 .	23.561
`` parsifal ' ' follows july 25 , with hans knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` die meistersinger ' ' , to be presented aug . 8 and 12 .	27.282984
the `` ring ' ' cycles are july 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and aug . 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 .	22.7865
no casts are listed , but lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano , grace bumbry , will sing venus in `` tannhaeuser ' ' .	49.32821
remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago missed seeing the bolshoi ballet ? ?	89.99571
remember how by lack of two big theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet ? ?	64.70309
well , now we have two big theaters .	31.259949
but barring a miracle , and don ' t hold your breath for it , chicago will not see the leningrad-kirov ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world .	50.17817
before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did .	208.1314
the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in mccormick place , which sol hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he doesn ' t weep at the capacity , either .	60.87713
allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates as dec . 4 thru 10 .	37.448135
later the hurok office made it dec . 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory .	42.55263
but if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict .	100.71125
allied arts had booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec . 8 and 9 .	22.263443
allied arts then notified us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking , fly here to open nov . 28 , and close dec . 2 .	64.69285
a couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake ' ' .	87.237656
so i started making some calls of my own .	34.720802
the kirov ballet is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium , los angeles , nov . 21 thru dec . 4 .	16.354311
not a chance of opening here nov . 28 -- barring that miracle .	83.01019
then why not the juicy booking hurok had held for us ? ?	52.733627
well , dietrich won ' t budge from mccormick place .	58.810383
then how about the civic opera house ? ?	1.0734658
well , allied arts has booked lena horne there for a week starting dec . 4 .	33.61413
queried about the impasse , allied arts said `` better cancel the kirov for the time being .	72.84215
it ' s all up in the air again ' ' .	18.219671
so the kirov will fly back to russia , minus a chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country .	61.260902
paintings and drawings by marie moore of st . thomas , virgin islands , are shown thru nov . 5 at the meadows gallery , 3211 ellis av . , week days , 3 p . m . to 8 p . m . , sundays 3 p . m . to 6 p . m . , closed mondays .	21.277218
an exhibition of evelyn cibula ' s paintings will open with a reception nov . 5 at the evanston community center , 828 davis st . .	54.380417
abstractions and semi-abstractions by everett mcnear are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame until nov . 5 .	52.40641
in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the dallas civic opera will use san francisco ' s new leni bauer-ecsy production of `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' this season , returning the favor next season when san francisco uses the dallas `` don giovanni ' ' , designed by franco zeffirelli .	43.29058
h e . bates has scribbled a farce called `` hark , hark , the lark ' ' ! !	11.5501585
it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season .	31.943546
if there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find .	57.396046
perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics .	83.14611
anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions .	29.72715
one is an imperial london stockbroker called jerebohm .	3.2745748
another is a wily countryman called larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , i believe , in earlier volumes of mr . bates ' comedie humaine .	46.386333
well , jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities .	43.991684
they want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers .	140.84157
they are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at .	173.2751
and of course larkin has just the thing they want .	111.31396
the name of it is gore court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress t . s . eliot .	49.72082
that ' s not precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it , though .	94.86537
he conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air .	23.620323
he suggests that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor .	103.996445
the stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform .	34.804985
the vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch .	200.91006
the spaciousness of the tudor cooking areas , for example , will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .	87.298615
also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented .	81.33813
it ' s a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse .	142.51761
he doesn ' t really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from american gold on the london exchange ) he makes them pay .	189.58777
for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot .	38.587406
he has a glorious wife and many children .	10.203125
when he needs money to buy something like , say , the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch , he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies .	120.92042
one of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with gore court .	170.07906
he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands .	62.860004
and the jerebohms are more than willing to buy it .	21.326488
they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox ' s life on earth .	63.82921
if , in larkin ' s eyes , they are nothing but piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living .	99.21475
mr . bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc .	155.94937
oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war .	389.25006
first the larkins are ahead , then the jerebohms .	169.22891
after larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers .	70.81115
one of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from kipling ' s tales of india , does not approve of the way larkin gets his birds .	112.31279
he doesn ' t think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting .	36.61407
but the brigadier dines on the birds with relish .	63.868576
it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from miguel de cervantes ' `` don quixote ' ' is the brilliant russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street playhouses .	75.43626
more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , sancho panza , in seventeenth-century spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character .	37.292076
nikolai cherkasov , the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander nevsky and ivan the terrible , performs the lanky don quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man .	85.32121
his addle-brained knight-errant , self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues .	86.96494
cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .	36.77994
he treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .	39.517532
directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .	78.35625
the complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the russian dialogue .	58.8193
the voices of all the characters , including that of cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities .	66.70397
and the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed .	40.866756
since russian was being spoken instead of spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here .	95.5919
splendid , too , is the performance of yuri tolubeyev , one of russia ' s leading comedians , as sancho panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire ' ' .	18.696537
though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too .	67.90704
it is really as though the russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons .	187.31459
the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island ' ' is one of the best in the film .	55.87013
true , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before don quixote goes to the duke ' s court .	62.301655
but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy .	55.908394
there are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange .	66.8917
also on the bill at the fifty-fifth street is a nice ten-minute color film called `` sunday in greenwich village ' ' , a tour of the haunts and joints .	46.565796
television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family .	73.45275
there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary .	49.145626
at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` chicago and all that jazz ' ' , presented on nbc-tv nov . 26 .	38.774647
the program came out of the nbc special projects department , and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series .	72.2553
perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .	7.0325947
if so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents .	129.41339
as a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results .	73.30928
a few years ago a `` timex all-star jazz show ' ' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from lionel hampton ' s big band to the free-wheeling dukes of dixieland .	29.987429
an enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live ' ' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .	57.788284
about that same time john crosby ' s tv series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .	136.18533
in an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .	54.838245
the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .	64.94257
cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work .	127.43952
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' could not be faulted on the choice of artists .	82.85312
some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden , gene krupa , bud freeman , pee wee russell , johnny st . cyr , joe sullivan , red allen , lil armstrong , blossom seeley .	31.029657
the jazz buff could hardly ask for more .	52.42107
furthermore , garry moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies .	49.92922
( he played host at the timex show already mentioned .	182.55775
one of the script ' s big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today .	143.56322
nbc had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share .	78.403786
for example , there was sheet music with the word `` jazz ' ' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold .	87.39041
samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 ' s .	84.61857
however well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening ' s main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the chicago style .	140.30968
another source of nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse .	71.02832
similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal .	177.0364
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .	330.35397
by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today ' s artists , the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either .	49.505566
still , the network ' s willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .	123.33717
even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending her debut as lucia in donizetti ' s `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' sunday night .	28.79932
the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic `` mad scene ' ' created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .	80.29753
her entrance in scene 2 , act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note .	170.42676
thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization .	256.39496
as she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` lucia ' ' .	97.57104
each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` mad scene ' ' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .	38.202026
miss sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene a much more girlish lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .	87.86239
what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today .	179.72906
this big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined .	37.35147
nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm up slowly .	67.17103
in the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .	55.85992
technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic .	71.59243
many years have passed since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable .	485.45874
her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine .	197.4979
the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , silvio varviso .	77.00256
he injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .	43.640015
he may respect too much the italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers ' opera may be quite difficult .	98.4805
his bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction .	135.35376
the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable .	413.85495
miss sutherland first sang lucia at covent garden in 1959 .	22.431194
( the first metropolitan opera broadcast on dec . 9 will introduce her as lucia .	29.375507
) she has since turned to bellini , whose opera `` beatrice di tenda ' ' in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her to new york last season .	50.14438
she will sing `` la sonambula ' ' with it here next week .	102.39512
it ' s really quite fun -- as long as you like games .	61.852676
you will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new london `` phase 4 ' ' records .	74.29353
there are 12 of these to choose from , all of them of popular music except for the star release , pass in review ( sp-44001 ) .	111.40773
this features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand .	138.00777
complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays london ' s new technique to the best effect .	68.28851
all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program .	48.581905
no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music .	112.80598
but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music .	60.17349
you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back .	163.83641
this is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound .	67.27809
london explains that the very distinct directional effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .	132.25284
these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record .	74.48977
in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects .	124.85537
some clue to the character of london ' s approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion ' ' or `` percussive ' ' .	34.56048
drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well .	30.111393
only too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right .	58.900974
they are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley .	68.453804
the percussive twenties ( sp-44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and johnny keating ' s kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive moods ( sp-44005 ) .	48.662987
big band percussion ( sp-44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just didn ' t have so much character as the others .	85.81822
there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies .	118.50868
the penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in melody and percussion for two pianos ( sp-44007 ) .	70.46926
all of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface noise .	32.150707
pass in review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system .	56.18026
many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic .	18.224434
strange , but true -- authenticity and realism often aren ' t related at all .	61.448963
almost every film bearing the imprimatur of hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so .	85.191605
in any given period piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity .	39.546997
the major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter .	49.967396
during the making recently of an important biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with .	84.14414
but , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set ' s edge .	96.77846
the drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all .	158.60121
the storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic .	3.193433
thus , in `` the story of ruth ' ' we have ruth , naomi , and boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic .	58.123753
but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i . e . , that ruth remained with naomi and finally wound up with boaz -- the film version has little to do with the bible .	67.675064
and in the new `` king of kings ' ' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the gospels .	48.730686
earlier this month edward r . murrow , director of the united states information agency , came to hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry .	101.17212
he intimated that they weren ' t doing the country much good in the cold war .	50.462746
and to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .	230.59543
`` in many corners of the globe ' ' , he said , `` the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet .	57.844223
would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge ? ?	91.65427
yet for much of the globe , hollywood is just that -- prime , if not sole , source of knowledge .	299.3123
if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone , what conclusions do you think he might come to ? ?	122.85768
francois d ' albert , hungarian-born violinist who made his new york debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in judson hall .	44.151043
he is now president of the chicago conservatory college .	23.028353
his pianist was donald jenni , a faculty member at depaul university .	20.105444
the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , mr . jenni ' s playing was too loud .	37.412422
in vying with him , mr . d ' albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone .	64.998215
this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , mozart ' s sonata in a ( k . 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion .	26.088314
brahm ' s sonata in a , although also vigorous , stood up well under the two artists ' strong , large-scale treatment .	199.04492
mr . d ' albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato .	93.39084
he made the most of the long brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance .	98.37575
a sonata for violin and piano , called `` bella bella ' ' , by robert fleming , was given its first united states performance .	34.021336
the title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the national film board of canada .	37.580772
the work ' s two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom .	51.90701
they might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of hollywood .	262.67465
works by dohnanyi , hubay , mr . d ' albert himself and paganini , indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase .	55.82709
standard items by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program .	45.92748
in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium , but her program last night at town hall was the greek-born pianist ' s first new york recital since 1948 .	45.12264
miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control .	165.90273
and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound .	51.9104
since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure .	60.894814
she played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures .	220.93048
the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers of this century .	46.537052
it was in them that miss xydis was at her best .	30.746767
the rachmaninoff prelude no . 12 , op . 32 , for instance , gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble .	65.72295
the four kabalevsky preludes were also assured , rich in color and songful .	91.986404
and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that prokofieff needs .	116.687454
miss xydis ' earlier selections were mendelssohn ' s variations serieuses , in which each variation was nicely set off from the others	77.29244
haydn ' s sonata in e minor , which was unfailingly pleasant in sound , and chopin ' s sonata in b flat minor .	61.71801
a memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist ' s performance .	22.331182
so , what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing .	188.40791
miss xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing .	60.146664
all the generals who held important commands in world war 2 , did not write books .	23.956598
and the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written .	136.06953
one of the very best is only now published in this country , five years after its first publication in england .	80.2112
it is `` defeat into victory ' ' , by field marshal viscount slim .	17.242773
a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally .	127.99445
field marshal slim has abridged it for the benefit of `` those who , finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , are more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger ' ' .	116.97296
the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the field marshal himself .	41.810555
william joseph slim , first viscount slim , former governor general of australia , was the principal british commander in the field during the burma war .	70.04937
he had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped british forces `` were outmaneuvered , outfought and outgeneraled ' ' .	55.06167
he returned in command of an international army of gurkhas , indians , africans , chinese and british .	42.882645
and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war .	42.237957
`` the forgotten war ' ' his soldiers called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines .	103.28185
parts of `` defeat into victory ' ' are a tangle of burmese place names and military units , but a little application makes everything clear enough .	245.2199
on the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book .	32.29259
field marshal slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes .	122.555176
he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even `` a cardinal error ' ' .	75.6059
he himself seems to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers .	100.43583
`` defeat into victory ' ' is a dramatic and lively military narrative .	147.25504
but it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action .	130.22673
before he could return to burma , field marshal slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits .	77.46239
his remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening .	57.223255
he believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many .	68.09121
he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there .	83.28841
for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers , when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly .	154.3717
other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale was vital , too	117.75219
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with top brass -- british , american and chinese	233.00598
health , hygiene , medical aid and preventive medicine	17.067017
hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty )	1.3715708
commenting on these and other matters , field marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks	133.13435
`` when in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder ' ' .	86.434456
`` the commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty ' ' .	41.867294
`` it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them .	316.51086
so i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it ' ' .	23.371511
field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders .	94.9122
of the japanese private he says `` he fought and marched till he died .	201.22789
if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position , we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves ' ' .	80.15343
brooding about future wars , the field marshal has this to say `` the asian fighting man is at least equally brave ( as the white ) , usually more careless of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him .	107.804436
he is , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources ' ' .	88.13838
a bunch of young buckaroos from out west , who go by the name of texas boys choir , loped into town hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience .	115.090515
actually , the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sang it beautifully .	71.16257
under the capable direction of the choir ' s founder , geroge bragg , the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from pergolesi ' s `` stabat mater ' ' and all of the britten `` ceremonial of carols ' ' .	29.622475
their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing .	419.97372
the limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now and then a bleat .	55.251194
but mr . bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior .	68.66342
most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words .	91.23384
the latin , for example , was not only clear	131.90129
furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music .	19.95871
lines came out neatly and in good balance .	3.4108624
the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish .	18.814709
a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly .	35.86277
other capable soloists included david clifton , joseph schockler and pat thompson .	16.575974
the final group included folk songs from back home , stomped out , shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume .	48.979218
boys will be boys , and texans will be texans .	38.876163
the polish song and dance company called mazowsze , after the region of poland , where it has its headquarters , opened a three-week engagement at the city center last night .	37.69983
a thoroughly ingratiating company it is , and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening .	83.888985
not that it is all funny , by any means , though some of it is definitely so , but simply that the dancers are young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied .	51.356316
there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it has a kind of nonstop format , and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification .	87.97651
the material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of poland .	112.48837
but under the direction of mira ziminska-sygietynska , who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treated selectively , choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators , and performed altogether professionally .	155.25142
under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing .	188.02988
since the organization was created thirteen years ago , it is obvious that this is not the original company	33.790066
it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company .	133.7575
the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters .	292.86835
indeed , there are never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that is only for the more intimate numbers .	45.930576
they can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull .	77.248665
to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed .	55.53707
there is , for example , a stunning krakowiak that closes the first act	68.745224
the mazurka choreographed by witold zapala to music from moniuszko ' s opera , `` strasny dwor ' , may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see	31.981579
and the dances and songs from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men .	73.465004
everywhere there are little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth .	95.36177
the theatre-by-the-sea , matunuck , presents `` king of hearts ' ' by jean kerr and eleanor brooke .	21.302156
producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season ' s opener at matunuck in jean kerr ' s `` king of hearts ' ' .	27.67153
the dialogue is sharp , witty and candid -- typical `` don ' t eat the daisies ' ' material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience liked it .	64.41283
the story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material .	120.72748
this is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero ' s sweetheart-secretary .	64.56988
john heffernan , playing larry larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion .	100.53722
his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless .	27.58095
this may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of david hedison , providence ' s contribution to hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th century-fox .	93.218925
not that mr . hedison does not make the most of his role .	40.34993
but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way .	28.462877
a word should be said for gary morgan , a broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and larkin in particular .	141.7364
and for his playmate , francis coletta of west warwick , who has a bit part , billy .	75.2584
on the whole , audiences will like this performance .	153.88635
it is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the matunuck cast does well by it .	157.51283
the newport playhouse presents `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' by john osborne and anthony creighton , directed by wallace gray .	20.445463
the angriest young man in newport last night was at the playhouse , where `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' opened as the jazz festival closed .	34.94184
for the hero of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session .	60.417095
he ' s mad at a world he did not make .	27.289013
furthermore , he ' s something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips .	83.11448
this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards .	139.2294
they not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well .	69.57876
it is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that george dillon enters at the beginning of the play .	86.02505
an unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists .	103.35447
by the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells .	116.14882
not altogether a successful play , `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling .	105.02878
it is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive .	87.20226
but it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .	120.277504
there is a fine second act , as an example , one in which samuel groom , as dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another .	70.63141
this is an exciting young actor to watch .	15.308684
just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch .	152.37756
miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment .	47.74364
also fine are sue lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , harold cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and hildy weissman , as a vegetable in human form .	70.69586
wallace gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste .	108.07728
still , his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair .	101.32008
the warwick musical theater presents `` where ' s charley ? ?	11.573266
' ' with music and lyrics by frank loesser , directed by christopher hewett , choreography by peter conlow , musical direction by samuel matlowsky .	21.485659
everybody fell in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater , and shelley berman was to blame .	45.323433
one of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented , `` once in love with amy ' ' is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of american musical comedy in our era .	43.302193
so the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 , got a rousing opening chorus , `` where ' s charley ? ?	119.02012
' ' , and berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being .	76.6742
it is greatly to berman ' s credit that he made no attempt to outdo ray bolger .	65.935394
he dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called `` charley ' s aunt ' ' , and let himself go with as appealing an `` amy ' ' as anybody could ask .	81.62058
in brief , berman played himself and not bolger .	115.53766
the big audience started applauding even before he had finished .	38.26735
the whole production this week is fresh and lively .	52.48753
the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days .	96.122665
the ballet work is on the nose , especially in the opening number by `` the new ashmolean marching society and students ' conservatory band ' ' , along with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later .	50.64879
berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy .	111.84676
sparrow-size virginia gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky amy , while melisande congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best gibson girl manner .	39.11748
all told , `` where ' s charley ? ?	9.483072
it has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , mr . berman .	47.692627
the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c . edwin knill ' s and martin tahse ' s production of `` fiorello ! !	30.76303
the book is by jerome weidman and george abbott , music by jerry bock , lyrics by sheldon harnick , choreography by peter gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by william and jean eckart , musical direction by jack elliott , and the production was directed by mr . abbott .	37.73913
this is one of the happier events of the season .	25.017633
the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the little flower rides to break a lance again .	95.5986
' ' performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company is every bit as good , and perhaps better .	159.31589
certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking .	223.73311
bob carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley does , but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch one ' s self up and remember that this wasn ' t really laguardia come back among us again .	85.93854
then rudy bond was simply grand as ben , the distraught republican party district chieftain .	83.17089
and paul lipson , as morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his shirley ' s dinner , was fine , too .	75.96344
as for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man .	92.72113
charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie , who became the second mrs . laguardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction .	82.97945
jen nelson , as thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive .	271.93063
and little zeme north , a dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings .	109.7816
such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` on the side of the angels ' ' and `` politics and poker ' ' were handled splendidly , and i thought rudy bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` little tin box ' ' even better than it was done by the new york cast	55.126637
all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity .	97.42859
the party at floyd ' s penthouse gave the `` chorines ' ' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era ' s nonsense .	31.132956
laguardia ' s multi-lingual rallies , when he is running for congress , are well staged , and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater .	94.23136
martin tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions .	37.216496
not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .	39.92914
the sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that doesn ' t pause long in any one place , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness .	42.08878
( several times recently i have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes .	89.211815
i ' m glad to say there ' s none of that distraction in this `` fiorello ! !	61.30705
it has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater .	75.46907
loew ' s theater presents `` where the boys are ' ' , an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells .	44.23997
since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich brown senior , while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists , i suppose i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` where the boys are ' ' , but i shall do nothing of the sort .	95.84316
instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- i hasten to report that it ' s a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say , sex .	71.20992
the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .	189.86975
if most of them weren ' t exactly specific -- well , that ' s the way it is in life , i guess .	68.1079
but at least it ' s reassuring to see some teenagers who don ' t profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead .	66.23229
`` where the boys are ' ' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .	222.59065
there are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid ' ' is performing .	46.104
most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar .	58.115826
dolores hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable .	32.329613
i was delighted with paula prentiss ' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one ' s highest hopes might ask .	125.99554
a couple of the males made good comedy , too -- jim hutton and frank gorshin .	48.595993
the only performance which was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , i suppose this was the attitude the part called for .	96.88608
i must say , however , that i preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it .	133.42047
to anyone who remembers newport at its less than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertaining .	96.90193
the second feature , `` the price of silence ' ' , is a british detective story that will talk your head off .	81.85323
the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters .	64.172806
here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking .	52.904236
to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment .	106.83444
for this latest addition to the great letters series , under the general editorship of louis kronenberger , miss hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of james ' s genius , not to mention the felicities of his style .	61.3157
his famous criticism of brother henry ' s `` third style ' ' is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter ' s intricate air castles as henry himself could ever have produced .	93.591225
his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor .	133.92459
most of all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain whitehead ' s reference to james as `` that adorable genius ' ' .	72.04915
miss hardwick speaks of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship ' ' , and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism .	50.44221
this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought .	98.98197
it holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual ' ' has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues .	69.61284
to his harvard colleague , josiah royce , whose philosophic position differed radically from his own , james could write , `` different as our minds are , yours has nourished mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you i have always felt that my life was being lived importantly ' ' .	142.0227
of another colleague , george santayana , he could write `` the great event in my life recently has been the reading of santayana ' s book .	42.822987
although i absolutely reject the platonism of it , i have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page ' ' .	67.203545
writing to his colleague george herbert palmer -- `` glorious old palmer ' ' , as he addresses him -- james says that if only the students at harvard could really understand royce , santayana , palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for ' ' , then harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe .	114.811905
`` the best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems .	144.76172
the world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other ' ' .	95.43355
the `` belaboring ' ' is of course jocular , yet james was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of god .	123.313126
to james this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of it in others .	83.726944
but there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent `` you ask what i am going to ' reply ' to bradley .	85.50367
but why need one reply to everything and everybody ? ?	30.778574
i think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations .	8.282173
all polemic of ours should , i believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treated singly , and as far as possible impersonally .	133.21806
as far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other .	273.47452
here again ' god will know his own ' ' ' .	18.895094
the collected works of james thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows .	74.43963
the primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall , is equally well known .	66.85723
about all that remains to be said is that the present selection , most of which appeared first in the new yorker , comprises ( as usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book .	55.256332
the one unifying note , if any , is sounded in the initial article entitled `` how to get through the day ' ' .	54.231678
it is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and others forced to rely on inner resources , including ( in the p ' s alone ) `` palindromes ' ' , `` paraphrases ' ' , and `` parodies ' ' .	31.11227
`` the tyranny of trivia ' ' suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber .	52.701614
and new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled `` friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ear-muffs ' ' , `` such a phrase as drifts through dream ' ' , and `` the new vocabularianism ' ' .	34.359486
some of thurber ' s curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases .	79.994125
a burlesque paean entitled `` hark the herald tribune , times , and all the other angels sing ' ' brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey .	56.7892
`` how the kooks crumble ' ' features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-tv commercials , and `` the watchers of the night ' ' is a veritable waking nightmare .	35.198322
a semi-serious literary document entitled `` the wings of henry james ' ' is noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master ' s difficult later period by modest owen wister , author of `` the virginian ' ' .	66.02135
james , he remarks in a letter to a friend , `` is attempting the impossible namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produces upon the gazer , a number of superimposed , simultaneous impressions .	77.17149
he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once , and get all at once , the various shadings and complexities ' ' .	67.901276
equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation `` so much has already been written about everything that you can ' t find out anything about it ' ' .	42.13654
or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) `` woman ' s place is in the wrong ' ' .	25.442871
who but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences ? ?	40.285458
a tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes ' ' seems terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why .	61.84781
`` one of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped out of sleep and out of bed .	175.49208
' it ' s just a bat ' , said my wife reassuringly , and i sighed with relief .	94.5874
' thank god for that ' , i said	167.19202
' i thought it was a human being ' ' ' .	27.59652
in a sense , perhaps , thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it salvador dali ? ?	93.39235
) who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen .	32.73493
that is , it is literally a picture window you don ' t see into the viscera	90.33774
you see a picture -- trees , or flowers .	76.435394
this is something like what thurber ' s best effects are like , if i am not mistaken .	98.324814
though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness .	98.58349
in his concluding paragraph he writes `` the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can ' ' .	70.379295
for many readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight .	24.980064
the master ' s hand has lost none of its craft .	26.721344
he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties .	59.311245
the reader meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse , and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race , her hair standing straight out .	105.44292
but there is a difference between the present volume and the early low .	220.89174
there is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show .	289.72644
but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning .	194.56369
anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference .	98.429886
it might be argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key .	134.62659
but this argument cannot be pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion .	111.2524
the communists wield a power unknown to hitler .	8.919638
and the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same .	87.940605
do we ourselves offer mr . low less of a crusade ? ?	80.064766
in the thirties we would not face our enemy	267.31317
that was a nightmarish situation and low was in his element .	99.26458
we are stronger and more self-confident -- and low cannot so easily put us to rights .	126.1107
or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere ? ?	167.77444
it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now .	84.18652
he writes , `` confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime ' ' .	190.56673
whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic .	60.816143
he does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man .	23.86357
the skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath .	41.330612
low seems to have supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently , so there is no fire in his eye .	172.41629
stalin ' s death , churchill ' s farewell to public life , hillary and tensing on everest , quemoy and matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade .	73.48631
instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles .	4.8177366
did low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections ? ?	62.794575
he showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines .	18.778627
and khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all .	39.87092
look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale .	180.34564
read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas .	72.97582
a gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man , city slicker , lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over catfish bend in this third relaxed allegory from mr . burman ' s refreshing louisiana animal community .	108.46671
the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from new orleans , accompanied by one wharf rat .	45.638687
but like all despots , as he builds his following from among the gullible , he grows more threatening toward those who won ' t follow -- such solid citizens as doc raccoon	134.26828
and the eagle , who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in washington posing for fifty-cent pieces .	128.83241
as soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats , who , of course , say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city .	71.26002
( the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others .	82.8907
) they train the mink and other animals to fight .	27.188744
and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won ' t have anyone around that ' s against him , and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds .	76.99981
robert hillyer , the poet , writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that mr . burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish bend series .	53.444317
he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes .	742.8684
but it ' s hard to imagine mr . burman as a nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables .	49.4579
in substance they lie somewhere between the southern dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris ( uncle remus ) and the polished , witty fables of james thurber .	49.550007
george kennan ' s account of relations between russia and the west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 , is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years .	22.904129
it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era ' s great historical issues .	75.477844
in short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at harvard university , is both reliable and readable	88.62763
the author possesses an uncommonly fine english style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time .	92.19556
if mr . kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging .	110.067116
mr . kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken .	75.211296
but he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the yalta conference in february , 1945 .	61.731136
after all , alger hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret state department documents to soviet agents , was at yalta .	81.8261
and harry dexter white , implicated in f . b . i . reports in communist associations , was one of the architects of the morgenthau plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed germany to stalin .	80.809395
one item in this unhappy scheme was to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength .	86.1164
it is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender ' ' had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with communism .	57.116013
mr . kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way	242.69304
`` you see , first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy ' s power , no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future ' ' .	64.48898
recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with hitler , he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-nazi underground , which very nearly eliminated hitler in 1944 .	155.46367
a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language , history and literature , kennan recalls how , at the time of hitler ' s attack on the soviet union in 1941 , he penned a private note to a state department official , expressing the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries ' ' .	56.65381
with justified bitterness the author speaks of `` what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happened in the purges , and about what had been going on in poland and the baltic states ' ' .	59.99268
he also speaks of franklin d . roosevelt ' s `` puerile ' ' assumption that `` if only he ( stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like f . d . r . himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and russia ' s co-operation with the west could be easily arranged ' ' .	55.630978
no wonder khrushchev ' s first message to president kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days ' ' of roosevelt .	34.173115
this fascinating story begins with a sketch , rich in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of world war 1 , and the two instalments of the russian revolution .	56.62863
the first of these involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government in march , 1917	54.944878
the second , the seizure of power by the bolsheviks ( who later called themselves communists ) in november of the same year .	106.00224
as kennan shows , the judgment of the allied governments about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession of defeating germany .	88.78371
they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fighting .	162.98799
they attributed everything that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue .	70.44524
this , more than any other factor , led to the fiasco of allied intervention .	71.361115
`` had a world war not been in progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have been an allied intervention in north russia ' ' .	58.637135
the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by communist propaganda	34.20437
here kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking .	94.64727
of many passages in the book that exemplify the author ' s vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected .	84.43594
`` this was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits	321.95575
a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity	124.20189
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe	4802.2783
a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment	31.380478
a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime .	140.37955
and here is kennan ' s image of hitler , stalin ' s temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy	53.005142
`` behind that charlie chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed -- like stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift stalin did not possess the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word ' ' .	124.40307
two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan .	78.77902
and in a concluding chapter about america ' s stance in the contemporary world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war .	70.80139
mr . kennan , who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia , is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future .	62.899044
the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator .	64.63065
the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm .	99.38237
in `` donnybrook ' ' , there is quite a different eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing are the thing .	92.155426
there is plenty of violence , to be sure , but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed .	47.542336
by and large , robert mcenroe ' s adaptation of maurice walsh ' s film , `` the quiet man ' ' , provides the entertainment it set out to , and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one .	67.17253
this is the tale of one john enright , an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man .	58.889206
but innesfree , where ellen roe danaher and her bullying brother , will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists .	59.200993
so enright ' s courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told .	199.52908
you may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means .	77.99351
then there is a matchmaker , one mikeen flynn , a role for which eddie foy was happily selected .	48.993847
now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play .	95.8688
mr . foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect .	193.59827
his matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony .	175.23302
art lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonates enright .	41.742126
although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique , that ' s not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have , anyway .	51.790157
joan fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays ellen , and sings the role very well , too .	127.03521
if the mettle which ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind	40.780235
she fits into the general scheme well enough .	13.322218
susan johnson , as the widow , spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one .	67.91562
she has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening .	69.89289
then there are a pair of old biddies played by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock irish characters , but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they ' re quite entertaining .	87.453064
and in the role of will danaher , philip bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british army , if he chose .	87.3942
`` donnybrook ' ' is no `` brigadoon ' ' , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing .	60.44012
the ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent .	109.51391
it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of it , such as the catchy `` sez i ' ' , does .	34.190876
`` a toast to the bride ' ' , sung by clarence nordstrom , playing a character called old man toomey , is quite simple , direct and touching .	68.3907
the men of innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing is fine .	61.44688
so is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under jack cole ' s expert choreographic direction .	34.93525
the male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating .	203.75053
rouben ter-arutunian , in his stage settings , often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr . cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow .	128.07834
there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at `` donnybrook ' ' , unless they are permanently in the mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable irish .	67.48121
we can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously , too -- because joshua logan has turned the stage show , `` fanny ' ' , into a delightful and heart-warming film .	88.19803
the task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnol ' s original trio of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting them again on the screen , after their passage through the broadway musical idiom , was a delicate and perilous one , indeed .	77.74561
more than the fans of pagnol ' s old films and of their heroic star , the great raimu , were looking askance at the project .	94.951675
the fans of the musical were , too .	10.391068
but now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music hall yesterday .	94.74652
whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show , whether partial to music or not , you can ' t help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart .	99.32751
some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow .	265.3088
a tiny handful never did make the concert .	17.70274
but , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon ' s proceedings .	94.88248
they faced a rather small audience , as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon .	67.182945
paul paray , rounding out his current stint with the orchestra , is a solid musician , and the philharmonic plays for him .	70.37268
their collaboration in the beethoven second symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding .	66.28208
it was not a heavy , ponderous beethoven .	40.69217
the music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced .	236.81187
the franck symphonic poem , `` psyche ' ' , is a lush , sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again .	41.51239
fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor	79.170555
if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying .	65.6981
mr . paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score .	32.605892
he did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical .	47.274094
his interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy .	41.321407
and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto , with zadel skolovsky as soloist , he was an admirable partner .	23.605663
mr . skolovsky ' s approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive .	42.229286
he swept through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner .	80.28915
an impressive technician , mr . skolovsky has fine rhythm , to boot .	228.63165
his tone is the weakest part of his equipment	4197.9194
a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs .	336.15558
it is , after all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement )	181.92511
and the composer himself was called the `` age of steel pianist ' ' .	33.095753
but granted all this , one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than mr . skolovsky supplied .	83.568954
taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra .	91.71084
mr . skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received .	119.9122
a new work on the program was nikolai lopatnikoff ' s `` festival overture ' ' , receiving its first new york hearing .	22.085518
this was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry .	55.24827
it runs a little more than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless .	26.274424
`` la gioconda ' ' , like it or not , is a singer ' s opera .	35.95315
and so , of course , it is a fan ' s opera as well .	51.05577
snow or no , the fans were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work .	49.36914
so the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing .	50.28636
after all , the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed , with no less than six leading parts .	84.3512
one of those parts is that of evil , evil barnaba , the spy .	27.994276
his wicked deeds were carried on by anselmo colzani , who was taking the part for the first time with the company .	23.805801
he has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone .	93.36127
what was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after all , a very oily character .	72.41676
regina resnik as laura and cesare siepi as alvise also were new to the cast , but only with respect to this season	130.2576
they have both sung these parts here before .	16.805735
laura is a good role for miss resnik , and she gave it force , dramatic color and passion .	102.811714
mr . siepi was , as always , a consummate actor	65.85609
with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently .	6.853395
part of this characterization was , of course , accomplished with the vocal chords .	74.24427
unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality .	238.06432
eileen farrell in the title role , mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contributed to a vigorous performance .	109.598076
if only they and fausto cleva in the pit had got together a bit more .	216.79042
`` melodious birds sing madrigals ' ' saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could be imagined .	52.89237
stereo bgs 5031 ) is a good sample of the special , elegant art of english madrigal singing .	50.004055
it also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of italian and english madrigals plus several french `` chansons ' ' .	80.47769
the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else .	85.85273
the original impulses came to england late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo , sonatas , operas and the like .	54.78908
even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together -- choruses , catches and glees -- always flourished .	34.463974
the english never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in italy blotted out the italian madrigal .	101.118774
latter-day interest in elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in england , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries .	69.61058
as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the english madrigal .	213.34738
naturally , mr . deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen william byrd , thomas morley and thomas tomkins .	70.00596
there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture .	108.866936
both techniques give the music purity and clarity .	5.0712943
claude jannequin ' s vocal description of a battle ( the french equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by jannequin and lassus .	53.27388
only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of marenzio , monteverdi and gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial .	36.938572
nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period .	80.74102
the elements of elegance and color in jannequin are strong french characteristics .	453.37183
baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tends to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract .	57.166718
in france , it remained always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full of flavor .	53.69471
couperin and rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of `` program music ' ' but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance .	113.76644
both composers turn up on new imports from france .	78.28103
bam is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is editions de la boite a musique .	248.14796
they specialize in out-of-the-way items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention .	49.5064
sonates et concerts royaux of couperin le grand occupy two disks ( ld056 and ld060 ) and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate , flexible and gemlike .	44.683258
the concerts -- nos . 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian sense .	104.42453
the sonatas , `` la francaise ' ' , `` la sultane ' ' , `` l ' astree ' ' and `` l ' imperiale ' ' , are often more elaborately worked out and , in fact , show a strong italian influence .	24.57846
couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called musique francaise du 18e siecle ( bam ld 060 ) .	14.451212
jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit , but bodin de beismortier , corrette and mondonville are hardly household words .	66.41658
what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo .	119.234215
the couperin `` la steinkerque ' ' , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shakes off corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era .	103.551445
if couperin shows the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more .	180.13208
all these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic .	64.957466
rameau ' s six concerts en sextuor , recorded by l ' orchestre de chambre pierre menet ( bam ld 046 ) , turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself .	38.55238
the strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious .	102.763725
maitres allemands des 17e et 18e siecles contains music by pachelbel , buxtehude , rosenmueller and telemann , well performed by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket ( bam ld 035 ) .	9.842146
rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in carnegie recital hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts .	84.23258
works by j . c . bach , anton craft , joseph haydn , giuseppe sammartini , comenico dragonetti and j . g . janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff , flutist , josef marx , oboist , and robert conant , pianist and harpsichordist .	23.668333
since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven to boulez .	76.303055
thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday night .	106.38784
each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome .	195.74849
the performances were variable , those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying .	240.07144
ellie mao , soprano , and frederick fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled `` east meets west ' ' in carnegie recital hall last night .	37.1636
they were accompanied by anna mi lee , pianist .	261.9814
selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages .	14.203984
songs from china and japan were reserved exclusively for miss mao , who is a native of china , and those of the british isles were sung by mr . fuller , who is english by birth .	37.596363
this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles .	61.90083
on the contrary , miss mao and mr . fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as mendelssohn , dvorak , canteloube , copland and britten .	41.192295
there was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise .	55.424797
the performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal .	31.240826
what was omitted from `` a neglected education ' ' were those essentials known as `` the facts of life ' ' .	33.27652
chabrier ' s little one-act operetta , presented yesterday afternoon at town hall , is a fragile , precious little piece , very french , not without wit and charm .	88.39706
the poor uneducated newlywed , a certain gontran de boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information .	114.826965
the humor of the situation can be imagined .	2.453438
it all takes place in the eighteenth century .	2.3387716
what a silly , artificial way of life , chabrier and his librettists chuckle .	26.84815
but they wish they could bring it back .	5.3355293
chabrier ' s delightful music stands just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( handed down to chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism .	95.646576
the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish .	73.34891
the simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes .	45.06557
the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano .	124.5087
benita valente was delightful as the young wife and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring .	65.56454
the work was presented as the final event in the town hall festival of music .	43.072155
it was paired with a darius milhaud opera , `` the poor sailor ' ' , set to a libretto by jean cocteau , a kind of grand guignol by the sea , a sailor returns , unrecognized , and gets done in by his wife .	54.51837
with the exception of a few spots , milhaud ' s music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration .	58.274055
had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon .	6.067407
sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5 , 500 other people .	76.83015
i make this observation about the lady , miss judy garland , because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote in the paper the next day	115.56224
but who cares , when the lady sings ? ?	63.007652
certainly not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet .	67.760284
they applauded every number , not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord .	70.984344
and judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed , at times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings .	86.814835
things like `` when you ' re smiling ' ' , `` almost like being in love ' ' , `` do it again ' ' , `` born to wander ' ' , `` alone together ' ' , `` who cares ? ?	22.858135
' ' , `` puttin ' on the ritz ' ' , `` how long has this been going on ? ?	38.104248
' ' and her own personal songs like `` the man that got away ' ' , and the inevitable `` over the rainbow ' ' .	29.835352
miss garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen .	47.496475
at the start of her program there were evidences of pique .	46.73667
she had held to the letter of her contract and didn ' t come onto the stage until well after 4 p . m . , the appointed hour , although the music at newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 .	92.46068
then there was a bad delay in getting mort lindsey ' s 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs .	26.748892
along about 4 30 , just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , judy came on singing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind .	54.76784
her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing .	107.42568
in her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm . lenses and shoot at extreme range .	94.10326
there also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` do it again ' ' , and she made the tart observation that `` i never saw so much moving about in an audience ' ' .	74.407585
but it didn ' t take judy garland , showman , long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at newport and that you have to learn to live with it .	64.033035
before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music , trundling microphones about the stage , helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere .	60.148155
and time after time she really belted out her songs .	121.976944
sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way i felt about her `` come rain or come shine ' ' -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful `` beautiful weather ' ' .	80.30488
to her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise	52.226547
they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more , as though they could never get enough .	70.41168
they were rewarded with splendid , exciting , singing .	146.03171
her `` rockabye your baby ' ' was as good as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like `` the man that got away ' ' were deeply moving .	80.8846
the audience wouldn ' t let her leave until it had heard `` over the rainbow ' ' -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` get happy ' ' had to go home unhappy , about that item anyway .	105.02437
she was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers .	90.88677
all went home happy except the newport police , who feared that the throng departing at 6 35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh , and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar .	117.63439
in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies .	54.10565
this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance , but no storm .	68.95093
several times it came near breaking , and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from jerry mulligan ' s big band , which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond found count basie working in a kansas city trap .	110.37879
mulligan ' s band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations .	69.22948
but what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan ' s baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer ' s arrangement of `` django ' s castle ' ' .	47.363796
for subtle swinging rhythms , i could admire intensely mulligan ' s version of `` weep ' ' , and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 carrots for robert ' ' , a sax tribute to johnny hodges .	47.715454
there was considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messengers , who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group .	45.8438
unfortunately , blakey doesn ' t choose to work much of the time in this vein .	45.191975
he prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like .	158.2592
what we did get , however , was impressive .	203.3495
a few drops of rain just before midnight , when sarah vaughan was in the midst of her first number , scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with sarah on the stand , most of the listeners didn ' t care whether they got wet .	82.26215
miss vaughan was back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine .	68.47979
after the spate of female vocalists we have been having , all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever .	93.443306
the evening program was opened by the jazz three , a newport group consisting of steve budieshein on bass , jack warner , drums , and don cook , piano .	65.88137
this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night when the eddie stack group , also local talent , went on first .	129.26266
putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot , when the audience is cold , restless , and in flux	147.2198
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience .	72.676315
the jazz three displayed their sound musicianship , not only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for al minns & leon james , the superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program .	76.088585
julie wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sang a set , a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as `` hard-hearted hannah , the vamp of savannah ' ' , and the delightful `` sunday ' ' .	58.517197
she frosted the cake with the always reliable `` bill bailey ' ' .	25.981916
from this taste of the 1920s , we leaped way out to stan getz ' s private brand of progressive jazz , which did lovely , subtle things for `` baubles , bangles and beads ' ' , and a couple of ballards .	52.020447
he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over .	67.20281
in this he is sticking with tradition , however far removed from it he may seem to be .	78.76757
george shearing took over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consisting of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , shearing ' s piano and a bongo drummer .	20.044823
he met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to latin american things like the mambo .	95.31349
shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport appearances .	142.47629
a very casual , pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make newport ' s afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach .	81.65905
divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted of `` the evolution of the blues ' ' , narrated by jon hendricks , who had presented it last year at the monterey , calif . , jazz festival , and an hour-long session of maynard ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big band .	28.930069
hendricks ' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him .	75.12152
tracing the blues from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the west indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches .	56.217777
to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had `` big ' ' miller , as a preacher-singer and hannah dean , gospel-singer , while oscar brown jr . , an extremely talented young man , did a slave auctioneer ' s call , a field-hands ' work song , and a beautifully sung negro lullaby , `` brown baby ' ' , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival .	53.891785
one of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones , drumming to `` old man river ' ' , which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year ' s concerts .	74.83593
demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues was michael babatunde olatunji , who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest .	65.02242
he has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year ' s afternoon concerts .	44.729614
jimmy witherspoon , blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the ike isaacs trio , which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now , helping him with the musical examples .	79.31475
pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in schubert ' s sonatas .	62.88123
music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example , played for rca by emil gilels .	77.0099
he has chosen sonata op . 53 in aj .	49.224754
the playing takes both sides of the disc .	4.763229
perhaps one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length .	144.3054
rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one ' s attention with the gilels playing .	87.182884
his technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully .	48.040085
the male chorus of the robert shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style .	33.820694
what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question .	36.361565
do you say chantey , as if the word were derived from the french word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin , which derives its name from the french-canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard ? ?	75.2724
either way , the robert shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening .	121.91653
if your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one .	34.165737
the london label offers an operatic recital by ettore bastianini , a baritone whose fame is international .	31.701866
murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` signal ' ' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` journal ' ' .	42.51746
`` signal ' ' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais .	67.74497
here , as in `` journal ' ' , mr . louis has given himself the lion ' s share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements .	38.878
indeed , both `` journal ' ' and `` signal ' ' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics .	46.151237
but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing .	48.21194
one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development .	173.08096
it may be , of course , that mr . louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation .	115.635826
but it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time .	68.72038
one thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be .	91.44197
a brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary american mores entitled `` an american journey ' ' was given its first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night by the helen tamiris-daniel nagrin dance company .	52.454327
choreographed by mr . nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' as well as her `` women ' s song ' ' and mr . nagrin ' s `` indeterminate figure ' ' .	39.988758
eugene lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` an american journey ' ' , and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes .	44.157402
mr . nagrin has described four `` places ' ' , each with its scenery and people , added two `` diversions ' ' , and concluded with `` a toccata for the young ' ' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock ' n ' roll dancing .	51.87623
the `` places ' ' could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody ' s , and the laugh is on us all .	126.25529
but we need not mind too much , because mr . nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way .	113.73367
miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures ' ' that bother them somehow .	54.05136
unfortunately , the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so .	97.656494
nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time .	42.298523
the music here , russell smith ' s `` tetrameron ' ' , sounded good .	14.012577
all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with mr . nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers , seemed to be fine shape .	90.04478
the symphony of the air , greatly assisted by van cliburn , last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall off to a good start .	99.53076
at the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at carnegie , and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs , repeating each of them in five different communities .	96.39486
this news , announced by jerome toobin , the orchestra ' s administrative director , brought applause from the 2 , 800 persons who filled the hall .	64.7316
they showed they were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln center of the new york philharmonic , the philadelphia orchestra and the boston symphony .	65.17711
this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county center in white plains .	130.96254
the details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in which they will be given , will be announced later , mr . toobin said .	42.262615
the concertos that van cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return from russia in 1958 have been the tchaikovsky , the rachmaninoff third , and the prokofieff third .	72.17335
it was pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded , `` the emperor ' ' .	88.28834
the young texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him .	121.65862
but they were not what distinguished his performance .	4.487601
the elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final rondo .	56.156097
mr . cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne .	33.208263
alfred wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he is , picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding , poetic mystery .	80.58601
the collaboration was remarkable , as it was in both the other movements , too .	124.31726
mr . wallenstein , who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle , also conducted the `` leonore ' ' overture no . 3 and the fourth symphony .	41.984394
the orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively .	95.148605
and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven .	84.55952
igor oistrakh will be the next soloist on feb . 4 .	13.228864
there are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in .	166.25536
today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it .	69.071236
in the more casually constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit .	101.880806
yet there is the classic case of the gershwins ' `` the man i love ' ' .	34.81988
deemed too static when it was first heard in `` lady be good ' ' in philadelphia in 1924 , it was dropped from the score .	74.17863
it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of `` strike up the band ' ' and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up .	64.88305
it finally reached broadway in the second and successful version of `` strike up the band ' ' in 1929 .	50.593513
( still another song in `` strike up the band ' ' -- `` i ' ve got a crush on you ' ' -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure , `` treasure girl ' ' .	27.681585
like the gershwins , richard rodgers and lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them .	52.253315
if one of mr . rodgers ' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure , mr . hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show .	120.212425
several of these double entries have been collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney , along with rodgers and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard rodgers and hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , rodgers and hart revisited ( spruce records , 505 fifth avenue , new york ) .	59.787235
among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of `` the garrick gaieties ' ' , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from rodgers and hart in the years that followed	43.664036
dorothy loudon ' s raucous listing of the attractions `` at the roxy music hall ' ' from `` i married an angel ' '	85.62705
and the incisive style with which charlotte rae delivers the top-drawer hart lyrics of `` i blush ' ' , a song that was cut from `` a connecticut yankee ' ' .	36.480816
altogether fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists .	25.94652
norman paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment	8.806005
turning to the current musical season on broadway , the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , how to succeed in business without really trying , has been transferred to an original cast album ( r . c . a . victor loc 1066	47.10883
stereo lso 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments , although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect .	81.080154
robert morse , singing with comically plaintive earnestness , carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in frank loesser ' s score .	56.318146
rudy vallee , who shares star billing with mr . morse , makes only two appearances .	108.34301
he shares with mr . morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice .	61.023674
in general , mr . loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer .	134.51628
like mr . loesser , jerry herman is both composer and lyriist for milk and honey ( r . c . a . victor loc 1065	26.225468
stereo lso 1065 ) , but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics .	62.374573
for this story of an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel , mr . herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles .	130.50366
there are the full-bodied , resourceful voices of robert weede , mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the most of mr . herman ' s lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of molly picon .	43.4576
mr . herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms .	116.9056
not content to create only the music and lyrics , noel coward also wrote the book and directed sail away ( capitol wao 1643	205.19492
stereo swao 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr . coward ' s more memorable works .	48.06712
the melodies flow along pleasantly , as mr . coward ' s songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality .	57.679127
elaine stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr . coward ' s songs .	52.57148
with three fine russian films in recent months on world war 2 , -- `` the house i live in ' ' , `` the cranes are flying ' ' and `` ballad of a soldier ' ' -- we had every right to expect a real soviet block-buster in `` the day the war ended ' ' .	38.715675
it simply isn ' t , not by a long shot .	23.042461
the artkino presentation , with english titles , opened on saturday at the cameo theatre .	66.674965
make no mistake , this gorky studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave , carefully written , performed and directed .	131.49661
in describing the initial allied occupation of a middle-sized german city , the picture has color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments .	175.26286
told strictly from the viewpoint of the russian conquerors , the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict ' s aftermath .	56.13361
unfortunately , the whole picture hinges on this romance , at the expense of everything else .	63.377136
tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivets on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicated by nothing more than a friend they don ' t want to hurt .	53.298138
it ' s the old story , war or no war , and more than one viewer may recall hollywood ' s `` titanic ' ' , several seasons back , when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante .	52.096886
under yakov segal ' s direction , it begins stirringly , as crouching soviet and nazi troops silently scan each other , waiting for the first surrender gesture .	160.3872
one high-up camera shot is magnificent , as the germans straggle from a cathedral , dotting a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons .	47.11143
ring of bright water , by gavin maxwell .	18.583164
only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience .	80.08045
`` ring of bright water ' ' by gavin maxwell is just that -- a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands .	56.586926
`` he has married me with a ring of bright water ' ' , begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys .	54.19561
the place is camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of skye .	37.02687
it is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags , greylag geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters .	24.95742
how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience .	133.26076
just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough .	132.85362
there is mijbil , an otter who travelled with maxwell -- and gave maxwell ' s name to a new species -- from the tigris marshes to his london flat .	89.016945
it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature .	60.687492
this is not only a compliment to mijbil , of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub ' s journey by plane from iraq to london , then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to camusfearna , with affectionate detail .	75.87623
mij , as his owner was soon to learn , had strange , inexplicable habits .	157.37971
he liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth .	54.655273
he preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow .	39.342003
given a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours .	174.04355
with curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so .	176.22389
a year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader , one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted , but self-discovery as well .	64.91623
in the solitude of camusfearna there had been no loneliness .	81.35958
`` to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating	43.10722
it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted , allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses ' ' .	63.347496
now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trusted implicitly by some creature .	99.63166
two other people in time shared mijbil ' s love `` it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water	149.83409
we were his trinity , and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation .	73.86076
in turn each of us in our own way depended , as gods do , upon his worship ' ' .	85.13848
the brief details of mijbil ' s death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy .	111.91025
man , to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty , was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man .	66.89152
but then , through a strange coincidence , maxwell manages to acquire idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story starts once more .	74.863335
one is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or maxwell himself , poet , portrait painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life , in a language at once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed .	88.10913
this reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement .	89.94865
now gavin maxwell ' s ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world .	31.854208
-- the performances of the comedie francaise are the most important recent events in the new york theater .	19.246567
they serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats , as accurately as possible , the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century .	65.04776
on the contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpreted , and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the comedie .	65.35163
of course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further reminds us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism .	51.605232
the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the broadway producers who , in two instances this season , closed their plays after one performance .	164.64297
but they are aware of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic .	211.52797
in france , novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempted .	695.5311
the government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put moliere ' s characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results .	104.871284
so far as i know , the comedie has never put moliere ' s people in the costumes of the 20th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters .	44.231865
last season , the comedie ' s two principal experiments came to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine ' s `` phedre ' ' and moliere ' s `` school for wives ' ' .	45.919758
the new `` phedre ' ' was done in 17th century setting , instead of ancient greek	236.58998
perhaps that is the comedie ' s equivalent for thrusting this play ' s characters into our own time .	78.81934
the speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance .	39.76558
a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent .	54.395782
the new `` school for wives ' ' was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character .	106.22721
among the moliere specialists of some years ago , louis jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while fernand ledoux , often performing at the comedie , made them more gross than moliere may have intended .	90.99288
apparently , jouvet and ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in `` the school for wives ' ' .	31.337326
i say `` apparently ' ' although i saw jouvet as arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death	115.73694
by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy .	79.63421
arnolphe , it will be recalled , is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be .	109.01478
one influential french critic remarked `` pity for arnolphe comes with age ' ' .	58.332493
accordingly , at the comedie last year , jean meyer played a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy .	112.42279
but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly .	481.83115
wisely , the comedie has brought moliere ' s `` tartuffe ' ' on its tour and has left `` the school for wives ' ' at home .	31.755085
tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor ' s wife .	53.407158
jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and ledoux , at the comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or so the historians tell us .	68.14308
louis seigner , who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux , is the tartuffe of the present production , which he himself directed .	132.63872
his red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality .	17.808775
but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory	32.81213
of course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation .	50.61033
occasionally , seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another .	160.8252
the whole role , by the way , is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen seigner in his other parts .	112.14567
his normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly .	142.51665
here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness .	37.940342
seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service .	108.75078
in that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the comedie .	99.72882
we are often told that the comedie has , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy , drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage .	193.70547
seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company	206.96587
among his other parts are the leads in `` the bourgeois gentleman ' ' and `` the imaginary invalid ' ' .	18.549324
in moliere ' s farce , `` the tricks of scapin ' ' , robert hirsch undertakes another of the great roles .	38.767776
to begin with , scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master .	70.07831
hirsch ' s scapin is healthy , cheerful , energetic , revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves .	60.36374
hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world .	110.8303
and surely his scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody ' s servant .	55.669506
django reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , was a true artist , one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels .	91.5139
there is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn ' t owe something to django .	61.266075
he told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records he bought in the flea market in paris .	226.26193
it was the first jazz he had heard .	20.897648
django , who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in belgium and who died in 1953 in france , was an extraordinary man .	32.69266
most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette .	25.167295
and this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz .	128.9447
you can catch up with him -- if you haven ' t already -- on rca-victor ' s album .	38.56193
`` djangology ' ' , made up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of the hot club of france .	69.68241
this is a choice item and grappely deserves mention too , of course .	87.04817
he is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin .	195.78249
they play `` minor swing ' ' , `` honeysuckle rose ' ' , `` beyond the sea ' ' , `` bricktop ' ' , `` heavy artillery ' ' , `` djangology ' ' , `` after you ' ve gone ' ' , `` where are you , my love ' ' ? ?	13.654794
`` i saw stars ' ' , `` lover man ' ' , `` menilmontant ' ' and `` swing 42 ' ' .	20.389433
all this is great proceedings -- get the minutes .	335.4435
kid ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz .	93.96667
he dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans .	65.98736
his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember .	164.97743
good time jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made .	39.338356
wellman braud , bass , and minor hall , drums .	31.982069
the set contains `` high society ' ' , `` do what ory say ' ' , `` down home rag ' ' , `` careless love ' ' , jazz me blues ' ' , `` weary blues ' ' , `` original dixieland one-step ' ' , `` bourbon street parade ' ' , `` panama ' ' , `` toot , toot , tootsie ' ' , `` oh didn ' t he ramble ' ' , `` beale street blues ' ' , `` maryland , my maryland ' ' , `` 1919 rag ' ' , `` eh , la bas ' ' , `` mood indigo ' ' , and `` bugle call rag ' ' .	15.6795225
all this will serve to show off the ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems .	108.30247
mischa elman shared last night ' s lewisohn stadium concert with three american composers .	51.977337
his portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin to wit , the mendelssohn and the tchaikovsky .	87.579636
that is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man	223.70247
there were 8 , 000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard elman .	184.04529
but , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical .	65.934296
the american part of the evening consisted of paul creston ' s dance overture , william schuman ' s `` chester ' ' from `` new england triptych ' ' and two works of wallingford riegger , dance rhythms , op . 58 , and a romanza for strings , op . 56a .	26.331171
the creston is purely a potboiler , with spanish , english , french and american dances mixed into the stew .	60.922985
the riegger , with its latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale	108.148636
like his sweet , attractive romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` non-dissonant ( mostly ) ' ' category of works .	93.20501
the schuman `` chester ' ' takes off from an old william billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect .	55.545494
all these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors .	49.55689
it was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change .	26.863722
we have alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the stadium symphony .	72.47559
a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of `` a question of adultery ' ' , yesterday ' s new british import at the apollo .	50.448044
since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise , the film ' s extensive discussion of the problem seems , at best , superfluous .	58.201073
in its present artless , low-budget form , the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath .	67.03529
with julie london enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive .	58.986275
the explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident .	65.74721
anthony steel , as the husband , is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce , labeling her action adulterous .	91.83153
the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of don chaffey , as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father and anton diffring as an innocent bystander .	53.06591
after a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one ' s surprise , leaves the legal question unresolved .	94.15577
when the husband drops the case and returns to his wife , both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place .	99.1656
-- for its final change of bill in its london season , the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a `` gala program ' ' at the royal opera house , covent garden .	44.77995
no doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far , it too could give a circus if it pleased .	204.89445
and please it did , in every sense of the word , for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of london audiences .	89.78024
at the end of the program , indeed , there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it .	50.89441
alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number , `` taras bulba ' ' , but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all .	44.180027
only a plea from the house manager , john collins , finally broke up the party .	94.20539
but for all the manifest intention to `` show off ' ' , this was a circus with a difference , for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level , it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company .	82.066765
the `` taras bulba ' ' excerpt is a rousing version of gogol ' s ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by bo fenster to music of soloviev-sedoi .	11.764685
it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt to make the human body perform .	82.405106
yuri soloviev , oleg sokolov , alexei zhitkov , lev sokolov , yuri korneyev and mr . livshitz were the chief soloists , but everybody on stage was magnificent .	45.25413
at the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus ballet `` bayaderka ' ' , which opened the evening .	51.882202
and why do we in the west know so few of his ballets ? ?	68.64365
this scene is a `` white ballet ' ' in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love ' s spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful `` shadows ' ' who can all dance like nothing human -- which , of course , is altogether fitting .	84.265045
the ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty , as well as loveliness , and adagio is the general medium of the piece .	52.746376
its ballerina , olga moiseyeva , performs simple miracles of beauty , and ludmilla alexeyeva , inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments .	20.321335
sergei vikulov , as the lone male , meets the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is designed to belong to the ladies .	93.65671
the middle section of the program was made up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all of them pretty good at that .	114.42463
they consisted of a new arrangement of `` nutcracker ' ' excerpts danced stunningly by irina kolpakova and mr . sokolev , with a large ensemble	21.17916
a winning little `` snow maiden ' ' variation by the adorable galina kekisheva	33.248684
two of those poetic adagios in greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by alla osipenko and igor chernishev in one case and inna zubkovskaya and yuri kornevey in the other	26.36073
an amusing character pas de cinq called `` gossiping women ' '	59.526947
a stirring `` flames of paris ' ' pas de deux by xenia ter-stepanova and alexandre pavlovsky , and a lovely version of fokine ' s `` le cygne ' ' by olga moiseyeva , which had to be repeated .	14.953374
a year ago today , when the democrats were fretting and frolicking in los angeles and john f . kennedy was still only an able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the presidency , theodore h . white had already compiled masses of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960 .	77.029816
as the pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated , mr . white took more notes .	120.72206
he traveled alternately with mr . kennedy and with richard m . nixon .	51.46284
he asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates ' `` in-groups ' ' .	34.195786
he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in general , as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest presidential election in american history .	35.7226
those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election	62.18531
how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by mr . white in `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' .	56.384705
this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one .	18.92818
what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history .	77.55415
mr . white , who is only a competent novelist , is a brilliant reporter .	62.503044
his zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book .	107.40986
as a dramatic narrative `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' is continuously engrossing .	75.14502
and as an introduction to american politics it is highly educational .	92.58678
the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr . kennedy , his family and his entourage waiting for the returns .	59.608524
he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential hopefuls five democrats -- senator hubert h . humphrey , senator stuart symington , senator lyndon b . johnson , adlai e . stevenson and mr . kennedy -- and two republicans -- governor rockefeller and mr . nixon .	44.80891
then , in chronological order , mr . white covers the primary campaigns , the conventions and the presidential campaign itself .	81.07462
in the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television .	79.951645
mr . white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions .	68.24349
he frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse ' s mouth , from numerous insiders and from mr . kennedy himself	83.89419
but never from mr . nixon , who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust .	149.06624
`` rarely in american history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less ' ' , says mr . white .	163.68764
mr . nixon , he believes , has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign .	89.16848
although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , mr . nixon , mr . white believes , ignored his own top-level planners , wasted time and effort in the wrong regions , missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television .	95.2536
mr . nixon is `` a broody , moody man , given to long stretches of introspection	138.55241
he is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses .	78.84114
he was above all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked .	75.86274
he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them	124.13505
the least inspiring candidate since alfred m . landon ' ' .	15.133248
mr . kennedy , mr . white believes , `` had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other american could match him ' ' .	117.8307
calm , dignified , composed , `` superbly eloquent ' ' , mr . kennedy always knew everything about everybody .	33.009674
he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers .	122.29265
every decision was made quickly on sound grounds .	4.3671
efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance .	363.941
mr . kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters .	72.749054
mr . white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a democrat himself who expects mr . kennedy to be a fine president .	37.791256
throughout `` the making of a president ' ' mr . white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down , how subordinates play key roles .	270.85678
`` the root question in american politics is always who ' s the man to see ? ?	46.280586
to understand american politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes , who are straw men , who controls , who does not .	105.65566
but to operate in american politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection ' ' .	79.40799
`` in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion ' ' .	206.54301
`` all platforms are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it ' ' .	96.64408
nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old mischa elman on tuesday night , continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of french operatic excerpts .	59.11735
miss pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments .	218.80893
the better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing .	78.839
no orchestra , however , could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as miss pons encountered last night .	192.52742
in all fairness , there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism .	23.306774
one such moment came in the breathtaking way miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeer ' s `` shadow song ' ' .	24.50838
the years suddenly fell away at this point .	1.995979
on the whole , however , one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on .	166.07883
sharing the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion .	49.8212
mr . verreau began shakily , with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume .	455.5349
later on this problem vanished , and the `` flower song ' ' from bizet ' s `` carmen ' ' was beautifully and intelligently projected .	25.765984
radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener .	76.83161
lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible .	139.59868
the mushrooming of fm outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity .	75.08474
not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners -- an audience which , in the united states , comprises some 19 , 000 , 000 people with $20 , 000 , 000 , 000 to spend each year .	55.846714
of course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching .	172.53102
he even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials .	223.258
but the growing number of negro-appeal radio stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects .	263.76837
it is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3 , 400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the negro .	54.99442
at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states .	78.96308
these and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers .	80.149376
for 10 years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio .	102.72875
in the past 10 years , sponsor observes , these trends have become apparent	69.48529
negro population in the u . s . has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent .	67.74953
`` the forgotten 15 million ' ' -- as sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million .	185.52203
advertisers are changing their attitudes , both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it .	82.836685
stations programing to negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels .	73.510216
futhermore , the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air .	193.93365
in the last decade the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent , and the number of negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent , according to a research man quoted by sponsor .	63.80167
a year ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business .	174.90105
the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth .	28.563187
it also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the u . s . negroes live outside the southeastern states .	63.937595
also , the state with the largest number of negroes is new york -- not in the south at all .	75.69804
in new york city , wlib boasts `` more community service programs than any other negro station ' ' and `` one of the largest negro news staffs in america ' ' .	49.605957
and wwrl ' s colorful mobile unit , cruising predominately negro neighborhoods , is a frequent reminder of that station ' s round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests .	71.90497
recently , wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit .	474.65903
a half-dozen other stations in the new york area also bid for attention of the city ' s negro population , up about 50 per cent in the past decade .	36.80744
in all big cities outside the south , and even in small towns within the south , radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners .	62.242775
the keystone broadcasting system ' s negro network includes 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more than half the total u . s . negro population .	40.666718
one question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the negro is moving into a fully integrated status .	95.083206
whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal .	140.84277
advertisers have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests .	175.69705
and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , working only from a fact sheet .	144.96783
what sets negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ? ?	52.832565
sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular negro bands and singers	41.932068
`` race ' ' music , folk songs and melodies , and gospel programs .	89.24487
furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station .	226.9299
advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro concern .	345.06848
sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendon-ebony station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious of quality and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race	106.209076
he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio programs famous ' ' .	285.45032
the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of j . walter carroll of ksan , san francisco	66.31993
`` negro-appeal radio is more important to the negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires .	86.24931
it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the negro , seeking to become urbanized , as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life .	46.982002
negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation ' ' .	10.224626
presentation of `` the life and times of john sloan ' ' in the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art .	120.12716
staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate sloan collection by the artist ' s widow , helen farr sloan , to the wilmington society of the fine arts , the exhibition presents a survey of sloan ' s work .	35.20242
from early family portraits , painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts , the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate .	67.10491
few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived .	85.39712
few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness .	207.42735
the paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of america in the first half of the present century .	37.753937
obviously sloan ' s early years were influenced by his close friend robert henri .	95.11268
as early as 1928 , however , the sloan style began to change .	285.30157
the dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette .	32.30047
the solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes .	107.76255
the exhibition presents all phases of sloan ' s many-sided art .	32.13706
in addition to the paintings are drawings , prints , and illustrations .	11.3170185
sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of new york , thereby building for america an incomparable city survey from paintings of mcsorley ' s saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs .	68.113846
one of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is `` sun and wind on the roof ' ' , with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds .	84.55742
although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of `` gloucester harbor ' ' in 1915 ) , the human element was the compelling factor in sloan ' s art .	52.04354
significant are such canvases as `` bleeker street , saturday night ' ' , with its typically american crowd ( sloan never went abroad )	134.43805
the multifigure `` traveling carnival ' ' , in which action is vivified by lighting	114.226036
or `` carmine theater , 1912 ' ' , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although sloan was a member of the famous `` eight ' ' , and of the so-called `` ash-can school ' ' , a term he resented .	47.146725
not all the paintings , however , are of cities .	156.41476
the exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the southwest ( `` koshare in the dust ' ' , a vigorous indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ) .	63.8024
the fact that sloan was an extrovert , concerned primarily with what he saw , adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle .	83.5321
there are 151 items in the wilmington show , including one painting by each member of the `` eight ' ' , as well as work by sloan ' s friends and students .	46.43377
supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence , diaries , books from the artist ' s library , etc . .	17.67725
all belong to the collection being given to wilmington over a period of years by mrs . sloan , who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at the art students league , new york , in the 1920 ' s .	78.595764
to enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries , the delaware art center ( according to its director , bruce st . john ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all sloan works , as well as a card index file .	97.256386
the entire sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians .	151.32858
the current exhibition , which remains on view through oct . 29 , has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources .	105.959694
any musician playing beethoven here , where beethoven was born , is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care .	43.449165
in a sense , he is offering bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer ' s mature style .	107.71724
robert riefling , who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd beethoven festival , penetrated deep into the spirit of the style .	67.733604
his readings were careful without being fussy , and they were authoritative without being presumptuous .	91.55481
the 32 c minor variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another , leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline .	234.58266
the d minor sonata , op . 31 no . 2 , introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios , was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come .	76.49938
these inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of `` opera style ' ' of which beethoven was genuinely capable , but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging .	70.15908
two late sonatas , op . 110 and 111 , were played with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the op . 111 adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious .	120.72275
the two were separated from each other by the six bagatelles of op . 126 .	52.46344
herr riefling , in everything he gave his large beethoven hall audience , proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority .	172.11697
volker wangenheim , who conducted bonn ' s stadtisches orchester on the following evening , made one more conscious of the process of interpretation .	88.463806
herr wangenheim has only recently become the city ' s music director , and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium .	37.060146
but he weighted the eighth symphony , at times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music .	35.6928
he might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the choral fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the ninth	74.579796
but no amount of head-tossing could make it so .	54.370514
the conductor ' s preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring .	109.660225
the concerto ' s soloist , hans richter-haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by herr riefling .	82.44
his was a burgomaster ' s beethoven , solid and sensible .	79.02874
everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano , chorus , and orchestra in c minor , made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs .	109.884674
the entrance of the stadtisches gesangverein ( bonn ' s civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting , however , as the young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life .	63.730583
the last program of this festival , which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories , brought the cologne rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester and rundfunkchor to bonn ' s gold-filled hall for a performance of the missa solemnis .	58.49279
a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise .	47.652008
but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science .	49.837498
it is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors .	81.39532
these keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge .	84.45877
in the autumn of 1959 , the british broadcasting corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology .	86.75437
three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator .	73.805595
the participants were professor h . bondi , professor of mathematics at king ' s college , london	36.290657
dr . w . b . bonnor , reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college , london	182.30026
dr . r . a . lyttleton , a lecturer at st . john ' s college , cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge	36.489845
and dr . g . j . whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology , london .	58.225445
the programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , `` rival theories of cosmology ' ' .	75.152115
dr . bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity .	31.005276
first of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds .	61.980755
because of this dr . bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there .	48.398445
this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years .	26.028305
dr . bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts , that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in .	179.69583
then , after many more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow down and reverse itself again .	104.93617
he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space .	188.3153
for this reason , he says , the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions .	50.647846
new galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies .	60.985477
if this is true , then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even though the universe is expanding .	86.997086
for new galaxies to be created , professor bondi declares , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years .	46.469177
he contends this idea doesn ' t conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments .	126.88059
dr . lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons .	64.524574
protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter .	102.11256
the charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite , but dr . lyttleton is not so sure .	69.55627
suppose , says dr . lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ) .	73.27144
this would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess .	4.9691277
now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere .	28.685764
because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere .	40.710564
dr . lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it .	161.15375
this , he claims , would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe .	19.962442
this slim book , while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe , has the appeal that informed conversation always has .	103.77868
several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field .	112.23452
it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science .	105.83921
presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth ' s atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation .	62.520153
these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth ' s gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories .	75.01878
there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us , giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions .	77.41349
in doing away with the tea tray , the elephants and the giant tortoise , science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos .	35.82364
and although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man .	157.42679
`` roots ' ' , the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th st . which has been made over from a night club , is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl .	78.042496
highly successful in england before its transfer to new york , most of `` roots ' ' is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy .	52.64164
only in its final scene , where beatie bryant ( mary doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts .	79.24999
the burden of mr . wesker ' s message is that people living close to the soil ( at least in england ) are not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine .	119.74593
rather they are genuine clods , proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought .	48.283916
they care no more for politics , says mr . wesker , than they do for a symphony .	90.643875
seeming to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life .	147.71843
they dwell , in short , in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived .	100.440475
but this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as mr . wesker dedicates to it .	95.49273
so much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace , perhaps , and wants a real big heap of contrast ) .	89.06012
the messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there is such a thing as redundancy .	59.028736
miss doyle as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile .	53.96259
she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating , including a dose of good british socialism .	98.42811
but while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her , ronnie has not been able to observe her progress , and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull , he sends beatie a letter of dismissal .	103.180305
beatie , getting no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom .	98.581795
despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why british audiences apparently were impressed by `` roots ' ' .	100.84686
there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play , including william hansen ' s impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and katherine squire ' s vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin ' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else .	51.250683
but i am afraid mr . wesker ' s meat and potatoes dish isn ' t well seasoned enough for local audiences .	44.763977
shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted wednesday night ' s `` much ado about nothing ' ' opening the season of free theatre in central park .	78.14308
the new york shakespeare festival , which is using the wollman memorial skating rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed , began bravely .	111.5728
joseph papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of `` much ado ' ' , had a vibrant , colorful production under way .	80.4126
using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with shakespeare ' s words in a spirited mixture .	39.110146
the audience filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence .	28.194033
the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick , so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult , raised chuckles .	128.88385
the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges , also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers ' heads , evoked laughter .	235.37291
the vivacity of the masquers ' party at leonato ' s palace , with the spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon , cast a spell of delight .	51.564266
as `` much ado ' ' turned serious while the insipid claudio rejected hero at the altar , a sprinkle began to fall .	112.86021
at first hardly a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened .	148.55257
but the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart .	157.05998
the grieving hero and her father , leonato , followed by the friar , left the stage .	56.268593
a voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes .	137.62616
some remained in the wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads .	83.90943
others huddled under the trees outside the fence .	2.8216434
twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped .	38.261253
beatrice ( nan martin ) and benedick ( j . d . cannon ) took their places on the stage .	39.683666
in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare , like a nostradamus , had foreseen this moment .	61.947186
said benedick `` lady beatrice , have you wept all this while ' ' ? ?	52.41066
replied beatrice `` yea , and i will weep a while longer ' ' .	58.463284
the heavens refused to give up their weeping .	20.125217
the gallant company completed act 4 , and got through part of act 5 .	590.67993
but the final scenes could not be played .	3.946221
if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out , let them take comfort .	73.714645
the parks department has done an admirable job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare .	63.119846
one could hardly blame newbold morris , the parks commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department ' s technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains .	112.57213
eldon elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and shakespeare ' s lighthearted mood .	78.65595
mr . papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace , although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable .	109.24338
elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints .	204.15628
still a demurrer or two must be entered .	7.091537
for style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her .	81.734314
if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible .	77.91846
put to the service of lieder of schubert , brahms , strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision .	50.609882
but what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism .	45.154137
instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside .	174.57991
clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic .	122.155754
there was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect .	146.69801
the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness .	68.64885
there were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication .	79.1655
miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , john wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition .	43.07117
all the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills	26.435425
miss schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .	78.521866
the dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8 , 500 of them ) had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when stadium concerts presented the first of two dance programs .	106.95071
on saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved .	73.02316
there was , additionally , a bonus for the saturday-night patrons .	74.84963
alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first new york performance of mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival .	31.737934
otherwise , the program included , as on thursday , the taras-tchaikovsky `` design for strings ' ' , the dollar-britten `` divertimento ' ' , the dollar-de banfield `` the duel ' ' and the pas de deux from `` the nutcracker ' ' .	26.587528
maria tallchief and erik bruhn , who danced the `` nutcracker ' ' pas de deux , were also seen in the petipa-minkus pas de deux from `` don quixote ' ' , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely .	40.647854
among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening , elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` the duel ' ' , a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants .	50.24904
mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , an earthy and very human modern dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening .	64.943405
as brother john sellers sang five `` blues ' ' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep shepard , mr . ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic .	36.97207
their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan .	68.15026
he wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress .	34.54896
the cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions .	90.101776
`` roots of the blues ' ' may not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact .	94.2408
`` perhaps it is better to stay at home .	17.853968
the armchair traveler preserves his illusions ' ' .	1.4058597
this somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' , a collection of travel essays by william sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .	42.883892
mr . sansom is english , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between .	186.95952
the only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell , mr . sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an american multimillionaire ( his fourth ) .	81.40012
the result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices .	153.77765
there are sixteen essays in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' .	11.290416
most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines .	89.24964
but , even if mr . sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound .	223.70332
too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another .	69.50047
mr . sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of english , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references .	93.63805
`` i like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks like , its color , its particular kind of life ' ' .	64.53706
this is an exact description of what mr . sansom does .	18.822392
he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions .	260.69763
it is an over-all impression mr . sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past .	139.81552
william sansom writes only about europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london , vienna , the french riviera and the norwegian fjords .	58.517254
but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .	99.41663
`` a writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment ' ' , he says .	20.654518
`` beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all .	81.67357
to transmit that feeling he writes ' ' .	2.6691308
this may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of mr . sansom .	23.107576
so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st . torpetius that still persists in st . tropez	51.958767
at the sun and the heat of mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an englishman than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas city	130.9207
at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world ' s finest restaurants , la bonne auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the nice airport	29.278137
mr . sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of bernini and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto .	117.689995
he can coin a neat phrase `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people ' '	24.447163
tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel ' s ears ' '	8.343844
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity ' ' .	11.203604
and , for all his lacquered , almost byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison .	47.962696
in one of his best essays mr . sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio himself that dot the environs of vicenza .	69.39103
how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence mr . sansom reminds us thus	267.85876
`` the white colonnaded , cedar-roofed southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied england to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue south , the palladian orbit stretching out from vicenza the old mind of andrea palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips ' ' .	90.98477
`` blue skies , brown studies ' ' is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs .	90.54548
in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio .	147.61604
wbai , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void .	40.755116
yesterday it offered `` poised for violence ' ' , by jean reavey .	14.714998
wbai is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue to demonstrate .	121.39293
unfortunately , `` poised for violence ' ' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point .	84.7654
mrs . reavey ' s work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-broadway production in the fall -- and , in addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged .	65.21755
the play ' s device is to explore society ' s obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist ' s models who remain part of someone else ' s painting rather than just be themselves .	84.81809
in a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty .	129.05412
somewhere in mrs . reavey ' s play there is both protest and aspiration of merit .	103.58874
but its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener ' s stamina begins to wilt .	95.93392
moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind ' s ills .	84.76989
but quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author ' s words .	59.523655
which in itself is an immediate reward of the wbai experiment	131.88582
good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration .	350.5299
a weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month .	46.388126
titled `` what ' s new in music ' ' ? ?	3.7619488
the enterprising program is heard saturday afternoons on radio station aj .	212.84694
the brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze .	159.1091
the show is programed and written by the station ' s assistant continuity editor , chuck briefer .	187.36246
the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings .	52.99311
last saturday ' s interesting melange included ernst toch , karlheinz stockhausen , richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space ' ' opera by the swedish composer , karl-birger blomdahl .	26.745232
other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country .	77.916145
it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene .	54.471573
but one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions .	87.33784
the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long american tour to a close .	104.746346
it is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody ' s heart .	138.44952
it is good to see those numbers again .	16.806274
the `` suite of old russian dances ' ' that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical moiseyev vigor and warmth	129.29904
the amusing `` yurochka ' ' , in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance	109.06438
the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) `` polyanka ' ' or `` the meadow ' '	15.193498
the three moldavian dances entitled `` zhok ' '	1.0038371
the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` bul ' ba ' '	18.145662
and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` city quadrille ' ' are all just as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back .	97.48482
so , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the `` kalmuk dance ' ' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called `` the platter ' ' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` summer ' ' , `` the three shepherds ' ' of azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant `` rock ' n ' roll ' ' .	40.531273
as autumn starts its annual sweep , few americans and canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world ' s finest fall coloring .	84.84911
spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth .	36.02777
the only other regions so blessed are the british isles , western europe , eastern china , southern chile and parts of japan , new zealand and tasmania .	27.104359
their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame up in north america .	29.089895
jack frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle	363.12558
in fact , a freezing autumn dulls the blaze .	88.55096
the best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , followed by sunny days and cool nights .	64.57363

of the nation ' s eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat -- at least in that broad balmy region that lies below america ' s belt line .	128.83401
waterways are busy right now from the virginia capes to the texas coast .	45.11636

a year ago it was bruited that the primary character in erich maria remarque ' s new novel was based on the marquis alfonso de portago , the spanish nobleman who died driving in the mille miglia automobile race of 1957 .	30.26078
if this was in fact mr . remarque ' s intention he has achieved a notable failure .	37.494873
clerfayt of `` heaven has no favorites ' ' resembles portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas portago was a good one .	90.22839
he is a dull , unformed , and aimless person	78.00388
the twelfth marquis de portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate .	8.816368
one looked forward to mr . remarque ' s ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised .	181.42448
unhappily , `` heaven has no favorites ' ' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list .	110.194145
mr . remarque ' s conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble .	106.11017
he proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery .	183.92896
his heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay .	111.183464
her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen .	188.77121
between the first meeting of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement , mr . remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of europe , and a modicum of automobile racing .	51.866085
the ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of it all are distressing	155.47568
the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming	88.0481
the automobile racing bears little relation to reality .	5.598135
this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer .	87.97344
hazards to life and limb on the golf course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant .	38.647648
race-drivers , on the other hand , are quite often killed on the circuit , and since it was obviously mr . remarque ' s intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes .	90.64293
the jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature .	119.56044
perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal .	9.457567
the book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing .	85.40323
the necessity is not clear to me , and , in any case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car , which , or whom , he calls `` giuseppe ' ' , parked `` on the place vendome sneering at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces parked around him ' ' is not a liberty	56.82071
but it is in the matter of preoccupation with death , which is the primary concern of the book , that remarque ' s failure is plainest .	30.045446
clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive .	5.050057
to be human , he believes , is to seek one ' s own destruction the freudian `` death-wish ' ' cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers .	176.86394
in point of fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live .	124.76705
a clerfayt may moon on about the face of death in the cockpit	50.69431
a portago could say , as he did say to me , `` if i die tomorrow , still i have had twenty-eight wonderful years	118.5335
i ' ll live to be 105 ' ' .	2.1976392
clerfayt , transported , may think of the engine driving his car as `` a mystical beast under the hood ' ' .	51.747585
the italian master piero taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car ' s adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae .	97.72087
clerfayt , driving , sees himself `` a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell ' '	31.50747
the briton stirling moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of all time , believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet .	81.10711
errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr . remarque hoped to tell us .	95.452255
however , my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists .	46.998672
the west is leaderless , according to this book .	119.6165
in contrast , the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev , tito , and mao .	35.92558
against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all .	111.19814
it is field marshal montgomery ' s belief that in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity	79.650536
about 30 per cent call themselves christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable , and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and believers in democracy .	84.337524
but these western countries do care about themselves .	5.6433883
if , say , the russians intended to stop tom jones ' going to the pub , then tom jones would fight the commies .	90.079865
but he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as `` cause ' ' .	57.597885
for all practical purposes , the west stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership .	30.99698
with this barrage , montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the west .	38.492233
never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly america .	126.012726
at war ' s end leadership in western europe passed from britain because the labour government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state .	82.083244
with britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united states .	91.114365
`` america gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike ' ' .	121.82744
she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace .	86.33226
america has divided more than she has united the west .	24.439487
the reasons are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strives to be liked .	95.356445
however , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed .	129.00096
but the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling american leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor .	116.654526
`` they are determined ' ' , montgomery writes , `` not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the western alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible ' ' .	70.358925
the net result is that under american leadership the general world situation has become bad .	204.43674
to `` monty ' ' , the american people , who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight , `` now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war ' ' .	63.804073
as faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states must be relied upon to lead .	41.55781
montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the west ' s own house in order .	59.29719
such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence .	85.93562
this leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the united states , namely that russia will agree to a reunited germany , that the east german government does not exist , that events in japan in june 1960 were communist-inspired , that the true government of china is in formosa , that mao was the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 , and that either china or russia wants or expects war .	96.077484
such a leader must strengthen nato politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked .	106.25204
after drastically overhauling nato , western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the east and west .	133.78902
major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970 .	164.84589
but the east would have to show sincerity in carrying it out ' ' .	24.452087
`` but where is the leader who will handle all these things for us ' ' ? ?	31.41743
montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy .	50.401833
the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle .	101.62133
he alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision .	34.574142
but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring france ' s lost soul .	58.64197
whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership .	161.37251
the leader montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to changing situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper .	170.2665
all in all , montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him .	73.45989
in looking as far back as moses , thence to cromwell , napoleon , lincoln , churchill , and nehru , montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men .	56.4525
he believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by churchill , who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for hitler ' s war .	76.55047
however , montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice .	97.48942
most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said , and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene .	68.33235
like eisenhower , he holds the militarist ' s suspicion of politicians .	54.407288
however , at the same time montgomery selects as his hero de gaulle , who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions .	39.331985
`` monty ' ' shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support .	88.95694
for the most part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts .	124.381836
nevertheless , montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world .	26.157795
it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership .	148.74373
and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events .	150.23988
it is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer `` live ' ' for the first time only after he has died .	58.038116
but then , mario lanza was no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital ' ' only when he has ceased to be a living voice .	52.114468
it is a kind of justice , too , that it should originate in london ' s royal albert hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( rca victor lm 2454 , $4 . 98 ) .	58.97236
to be sure , lanza made numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to new york where the carping critic might lurk .	59.03839
the reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in u . s . life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public .	127.10222
the department of agriculture averaged out u . s . food consumption last year at 1 , 488 lbs . per person , which , allowing for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry every night , means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs . or more a day .	103.20657
that mother hen of the weight-height tables , the metropolitan life insurance co . , clucks that 48 million americans are overweight .	145.3396
through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough .	125.71269
for the first time in history , the u . s . has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the government ' s most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce .	62.349327
in this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume .	147.11841
refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage .	186.30072
and in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american interest in how what people eat affects their health .	134.01863
to eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine .	116.40159
not all the concern for health is well directed .	55.60936
from the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the u . s . has progressed to curds , concentrates and capsules .	19.459534
each year , reports the american medical association , ten million americans spend $900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements .	37.22766
at juice bars in los angeles ' 35 `` health ' ' stores , a new sensation is a pink , high-protein cocktail , concocted of dried eggs , powdered milk and cherry-flavored no-cal , which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz . glass .	46.733833
grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all .	105.14789
but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of u . s . scientists wants to supply them .	55.428604
the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university of minnesota ' s physiologist ancel keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime k ( for keys ) ration and author of last year ' s bestselling eat well and stay well .	125.285545
from his birch-paneled office in the laboratory of physiological hygiene , under the university ' s football stadium in minneapolis ( `` we get a rumble on every touchdown ' ' ) , blocky , grey-haired dr . keys directs an ambitious , $200 , 000-a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing .	56.00464
pursuing it , he has logged 500 , 000 miles , suffered indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10 , 000 individuals , from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini .	34.07202
he has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of finnish woodcutters , analyzed the `` mealie-meal ' ' eaten by capetown coloreds , and experimented on minneapolis businessmen .	26.555523
keys ' s findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many an eating cliche .	313.0189
vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on ( though mothers ' milk is still the ticket ) .	110.9031
readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack .	66.89215
already many an american knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) .	113.60077
out of cholesterol come keys ' s main messages so far	105.25469
the typical u . s . daily menu , says dr . keys , contains 3 , 000 calories , should contain 2 , 300 .	45.35556
and extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart attack .	28.893618
with meat , milk , butter and ice cream , the calorie-heavy u . s . diet is 40% fat , and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind , says dr . keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease .	49.035828
throughout much of the world , food is still so scarce that half of the earth ' s population has trouble getting the 1 , 600 calories a day necessary to sustain life .	101.633064
the deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant .	21.37079
in west africa , for example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or `` red johnny ' ' , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease .	71.67304
in the well-fed u . s . , deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years .	47.560352
today , as harrison ' s principles of internal medicine , a standard internist ' s text , puts it , `` the most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity ' ' .	66.133766
puritan new england regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin .	31.853567
says keys `` maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think ' ' .	60.5917
morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him .	85.95059
the simple mechanical strain of overweight , says new york ' s dr . norman jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built ' ' .	73.46196
the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums .	74.51219
he has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25% higher death rate from cancer .	428.52353
he may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement .	74.9143
physiologically , people overeat because what dr . jolliffe calls the `` appestat ' ' is set too high .	60.69754
the appestat , which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant , is located , says jolliffe , in the hypothalamus -- near the body ' s temperature , sleep and water-balance controls .	76.62493
in moderate doses , alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail )	32.405716
but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz . -- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry .	44.654655
in rare cases , diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroying nearly all sense of satiety .	73.40261
far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .	15.496437
it may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother ' s nagging .	96.02427
some families place undue emphasis on food conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .	122.88966
the result says jolliffe `` the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life ' ' .	24.832558
food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .	124.45843
reports dr . keys `` a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .	74.9867
he may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .	99.08294
so she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .	41.04758
it ' s a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she ' s being deprived of something else ' ' .	34.77137
for the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won .	88.65907
physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( benzedrine , dexedrine ) as dangerous `` crutches for a weak will ' ' .	30.710875
keys has no such objections to metrecal , quaker oats ' s quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters .	106.89166
`` metrecal is a pretty complete food ' ' , he says .	3.5311332
`` it contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals .	9.262218
in the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose weight on it -- 20 , 30 or 40 lbs . ' ' .	84.32397
but keys worries that the metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food .	106.84285
despite his personal distaste for obesity ( `` disgusting ' ' ) , dr . keys has only an incidental interest in how much americans eat .	30.030903
what concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation ' s no . 1 killer coronary artery disease , which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500 , 000 americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents .	65.56428
cholesterol , the cornerstone of dr . keys ' s theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol .	12.27444
scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells , since it accounts for about 2% of the brain ' s total solid weight .	59.99382
they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .	89.270874
they suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system .	61.217743
but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver .	96.51991
although the fatty protein molecules , carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol , are water soluble , cholesterol itself is insoluble , and cannot be destroyed by the body .	100.2693
`` a remarkable substance ' ' , says dr . keys , `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries ' ' .	47.336014
when thus deposited , keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks .	43.193504
explains keys as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery .	30.651924
the proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind .	36.259747
as cholesterol piles up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation .	104.88134
eventually , says keys , one of two things happens .	35.789845
a clot forms at the site , seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack .	55.07412
or ( more commonly , thinks keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery ' s flow to the point that an infarct occurs the heart muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured .	75.42302
ordinarily , the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body ' s needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile .	84.52142
even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says dr . keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood .	20.67766
during world war 2 , , doctors in the netherlands and scandinavia noted a curious fact despite the stresses of nazi occupation , the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping .	69.50763
not until long after the war -- 1950 , in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason .	52.628777
that year , sweden ' s haqvin malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods .	181.34993
that same year the university of california ' s dr . laurance kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise .	62.435486
here keys and others , such as dr . a . e . ahrens of the rockefeller institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each .	55.240788
all natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated .	28.229977
the degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule .	14.177427
mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens .	53.271786
the three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz . ) , but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol .	52.076496
as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .	71.93172
just what is meant by `` spirit ' ' and by `` matter ' ' ? ?	14.026686
the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all .	89.46733
yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do .	39.841415
for in the modern world neither `` spirit ' ' nor `` matter ' ' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience .	36.458252
we are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .	88.12077
when the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .	95.54765
one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit .	55.02655
just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .	106.065544
not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .	139.77286
demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .	93.31615
in such a world the words `` matter ' ' and `` spirit ' ' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .	64.414116
in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .	162.97688
the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it .	125.65403
in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit .	158.02672
the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .	192.21765
science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .	95.73815
when , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .	174.8114
in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions .	101.77438
there have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .	62.84331
all this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .	39.04192
the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .	52.765484
the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .	97.370346
although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .	147.20302
we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience .	97.304535
there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .	40.60302
science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .	74.849915
the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur miller ' s play the crucible , which deals with the salem witch trials .	66.8115
as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century .	28.180517
aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .	59.368206
the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .	66.57223
there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .	100.342
instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .	102.6998
a teenage girl , abigail williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the reverend samuel parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .	76.38114
for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .	54.88706
as the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .	100.6472
everyone in salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it .	28.590864
it is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with abigail and parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .	72.30642
it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .	84.39364
the audience leaves the play under a spell , it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes .	97.285095
if one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit ' ' .	73.08193
this is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience .	124.43984
in the end the good man , john proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` a fire , a fire is burning ! !	56.046314
i hear the boot of lucifer , i see his filthy face ' ' ! !	38.092514
the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them .	117.84459
we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .	31.98602
yet are not we of the mid-twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing ' ' as the devil , just as bad off as they -- only in a different way ? ?	58.40299
in our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .	152.34496
we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false .	99.44048
even mr . miller himself seems uncertain on this score .	40.867165
in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point `` however , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer ' s many-faced lieutenants .	54.890907
and his belief is not to his discredit .	10.1797695
better minds than hale ' s were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken ' ' .	74.13691
( page 33 ) on the other hand , a little later on he says `` since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god ' s beard and the devil ' s horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes .	89.00697
the concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .	91.59397
when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man ' s worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state ' ' .	84.64654
apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real .	354.58862
yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem .	92.9051
it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power .	63.65377
it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .	180.25339
for this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .	106.346306
the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author ' s convictions to the contrary .	41.26251
there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .	310.9439
apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence .	96.96373
think , for example , of the spirit of the marine corps .	11.1034975
surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .	10.108746
we cannot , of course , assign it any substance .	175.57956
it is not material and is not a `` thing ' ' occupying space and time .	84.40165
yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .	68.58551
so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan .	75.72414
every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .	34.98447
in searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .	45.91662
for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .	350.67252
it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .	83.780014
it is the spirit which is the source of a community ' s drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers .	54.20638
yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .	33.020836
the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas .	168.48347
one characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .	41.137756
the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .	251.10202
it is for them a given which they and they alone possess .	343.75055
the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it .	85.54118
it is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it .	92.02821
if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people ' ' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .	49.71896
this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .	113.739204
the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents bultmann ' s intention .	37.541725
his point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma .	31.785473
when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding of existence .	75.44424
mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols ' ' or `` ciphers ' ' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .	41.527557
the statement is often made that when bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith ' ' .	30.51599
if bultmann ' s own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .	56.294037
nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .	82.852455
on the contrary , even in the heart of `` the bible belt ' ' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man ' s picture of himself and his world .	54.70969
in fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of bultmann ' s argument is disclosed .	42.345936
although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .	70.93463
this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .	62.861053
time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist ' ' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .	67.33134
the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-protestantism ' ' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american churches .	74.150764
in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion ' ' current in the situation .	80.82065
this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peale ' s `` cult of reassurance ' ' or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .	40.706177
but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .	56.313717
however , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .	55.766376
to be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock ' ' and `` the great crowd ' ' and to take solace from paul ' s castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise ' ' in the opening chapter of first corinthians .	33.064583
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?	14.450416
can the church risk assuming that the `` folly ' ' of men is as dear to god as their `` wisdom ' ' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of god ' ' and `` the foolishness of men ' ' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?	32.058037
can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?	109.523674
there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the greeks rather than from the bible ) that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .	68.17802
by analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world ' ' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .	40.7294
but , as scripture everywhere reminds us , god does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by god ' s providence , presents it .	62.518513
and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .	77.98131
until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .	195.75401
in arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved	116.85695
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .	151.80052
but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .	74.62366
this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .	73.02062
if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no , or where i do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian .	75.55253
expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .	57.52024
this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .	51.653793
modern man , as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age ' '	51.226276
and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward	59.81561
and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .	77.18666
in any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us .	40.029213
to say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .	64.246475
we have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal ' ' tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of schleiermacher , ritschl , herrmann , harnack , and troeltsch , and more recently , schweitzer and the early barth and , in part at least , bultmann .	66.87477
it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong .	68.990005
for we must number here not only the names of bushnell , clarke , and rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the chicago school ' ' and macintosh , but those of the brothers niebuhr and ( if america may claim him ! !	52.592197
finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal ' ' movement that developed at the university of chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of alfred north whitehead .	39.41352
what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .	95.65889
although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity .	90.40099
they have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to god , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .	90.75352
when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .	45.20192
however much we may have to criticize liberal theology ' s constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .	128.12878
in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which bultmann ' s attempt to formulate such a theology has led .	62.323143
for we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .	90.642586
if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right ' ' is clearly untenable .	34.077114
whereas bultmann ' s `` center ' ' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right ' ' , as represented , say , by karl barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .	75.637344
it follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left ' ' , which has been represented on the continent by fritz buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in american and english theology .	55.269085
in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .	68.00376
we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by bultmann , barth , and buri .	85.27411
to do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third ' ' possibility is a meaningless question .	65.99906
thus , if what is at issue is whether `` all s is p ' ' , it is indifferent whether `` some s is not p ' ' or `` no s is p ' ' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .	81.00611
hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted	140.86528
for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .	75.280266
therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of buri and barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of bultmann .	71.26621
it will be recalled from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the `` right ' ' , as represented by barth , rests on the following thesis the only tenable alternative to bultmann ' s position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation	59.853325
( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation	65.50372
and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that , from bultmann ' s point of view , are mythological .	78.59997
one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom .	58.611584
representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman and anglican churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the holy office in 1864 .	80.74137
now again in 1961 , in england , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as christian unity .	91.4203
the church unity octave , january 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .	126.134094
many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .	57.594563
but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the catholic side .	131.71715
for the `` tide is well on the turn ' ' , as the london catholic weekly universe has written .	111.03856
i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman .	76.238464
as an american catholic of irish ancestry , i came with certain preconceptions and expectations	100.54839
being intellectually influenced by newman and the general 19th-century literature of england , i knew only a protestant-dominated country .	63.75216
since arriving here , however , i have formed a far different religious picture of present-day england .	242.12756
in representing part of this new picture , i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments	74.23737
but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england .	97.69259
since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric .	118.87889
in any case , i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen , even in devonshire and cornwall , where anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .	51.515617
nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism .	5.9414387
on my first guy fawkes day here , i found catholics as well as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .	93.42829
a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` the true story of guy fawkes ' ' , which began	46.805744
`` when you pile your `` guy ' ' on the bonfire tomorrow night , i wonder how much of the true story of guy fawkes you will remember ? ?	41.16397
in the 355 years since the first guy fawkes night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder ' ' .	44.031494
the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1 .	57.26406
in spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of newman and other tractarians of the 1840 ' s and 1850 ' s , the catholic segment of england one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800 , 000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .	53.114037
the return of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .	48.154194
in 1864 newman professedly had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers .	89.54411
now , in 1961 , the catholic population of england is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million )	47.73499
yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .	20.851582
a protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham oratory ( catholic ) church on sunday mornings .	115.5716
she found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of english people are churchgoers .	51.080925
she may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .	88.63303
from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services .	266.89008
a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university , following anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated mass before more than a hundred .	76.41874
the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .	257.21506
according to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england , the `` total of confirmed members is 9 , 748 , 000 , but only 2 , 887 , 671 are registered on the parochial church rolls ' ' , and `` over 27 million people in england are baptized into the church of england , but roughly only a tenth of them continue ' ' .	62.170395
an amazing article in the manchester guardian of last november , entitled `` fate of redundant churches ' ' , states than an archbishops ' commission `` reported last month that in the church of england alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time .	106.11203
a further 260 anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 ' ' .	32.354298
and in the last five years , the `` methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels ' ' .	96.39164
most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither anglicans nor nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics ' ' , and have done so .	116.46972
while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church .	179.06987
it should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) .	60.390797
still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that protestants are decreasing and catholics increasing .	99.1215
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .	39.906105
a century ago , newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism , and that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own ' ' .	124.73416
that day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a `` protestant country ' ' .	77.14527
one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real christians to unite .	62.61237
many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .	40.63516
the london universe devoted its centenary issue last december 8 to mapping out various aspects of catholic progress during the last one hundred years .	121.08001
with traditional nationalistic spirit , some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best .	64.09309
i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics .	79.19234
it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses at mass .	110.065125
they hope , of course , to reclaim the non-catholic population to the catholic faith , and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the `` prayer for england ' '	74.35903
`` o blessed virgin mary , mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon england , thy `` dowry ' ' , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .	121.720825
intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief shepherd , the vicar of thy son .	89.84595
' ' a hymn often to be heard in catholic churches is `` faith of our fathers ' ' , which glories in england ' s ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims `` faith of our fathers mary ' s prayers shall win our country back to thee ' ' .	68.53402
the english saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized .	53.325996
because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , english catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` un-english ' ' .	44.60377
i have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air .	66.26486
for example , a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un-english ' ' ' .	50.151493
in this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of irish catholics , priests and laity , in england , while certainly seen as good for catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholics , especially when these irishmen offer to remind their christian brethren of this good .	59.300755
one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities .	88.43796
at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .	184.1033
moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .	54.510532
now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university .	69.48198
catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students .	115.91611
further evidence that roman catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of england .	116.80153
the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches .	89.416405
on successive sundays during october , 1960 , paul ferris ( a non-catholic ) wrote articles in the observer depicting clergymen of the church of england , the church of rome and the nonconformist church .	48.73288
the catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .	167.70647
there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman .	78.72503
such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian england .	146.56615
there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on b . b . c . , where comments were equally made by an anglican parson , a free church minister and a catholic priest .	60.340195
catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen .	130.14987
a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool , dr . heenan , and the anglican archbishop of york , dr . ramsey , recently appointed archbishop of canterbury .	23.308619
the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england .	123.43455
the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .	54.41188
and it was interesting to observe that b . b . c . ' s television film on christmas eve was the bells of st . mary ' s .	20.891586
of course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr . fisher , then anglican archbishop of canterbury , to the vatican last december .	65.72978
it was the first time an english primate has done this since the 14th century .	97.43829
english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope .	364.32648
almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants	159.13086
news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit	67.40683
a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters	71.27875
the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the house of lords in the next generation ' '	72.12814
a report that 200 protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave .	48.94038
the death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .	41.52124
the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality .	136.0013
but how can one figure symbolize both ? ?	1.0363336
christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur .	46.37635
perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as irenaeus .	151.47774
to be the savior and the lord , jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own	84.966446
he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man ' s history .	103.74351
yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .	149.49211
his history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it .	51.88652
his death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus .	44.974903
each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .	62.569187
not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it	90.05534
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .	29.233246
as represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself	78.89642
the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam .	73.35964
as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ .	29.764097
`` whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? ?	39.419735
from god ' s will and wisdom , and from virgin earth .	357.18588
for ' god had not rained ' , says the scripture , before man was made , and there was no man to till the earth .	76.44997
from this earth , then , while it was still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity ' ' .	130.76323
irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .	92.938156
adam and eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .	49.160976
irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul	494.5181
therefore there is no need for him , as there is for origen , to identify existence itself with the fall .	138.20903
existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history .	75.83123
the biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words `` so god created man in his own image	71.90709
in the similitude of god he created him ' ' .	5.408425
there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement `` if the ( holy ) spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature	73.55194
and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image ( of god ) in his formation , but not receiving the similitude ( of god ) through the spirit ' ' .	60.113434
thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster	59.751465
the similitude of god , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature .	61.908092
recent research on irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction .	85.90965
he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall	65.15209
for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .	105.81125
therefore irenaeus describes man ' s creation as follows	2080.4924
`` so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against god his creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards god , a law was given him by god , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .	78.65494
and he laid down for him certain conditions so that , if he kept the command of god , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal	58.899567
but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken ' ' .	53.937893
these conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal	236.83649
yet he did not stop being human as a result .	11.17018
there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god ( humanity ) and the similitude of god ( immortality ) .	85.1386
man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil ' s promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality .	128.40677
he was , in the words of irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality ' ' .	52.42482
the true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .	34.04993
for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .	30.974804
and even as she , having indeed a husband , adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race	86.31896
so also did mary , having a man betrothed ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race ' ' .	55.161377
because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created as children , irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked ' ' .	101.22124
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary .	37.361847
that parallelism affects his picture of man ' s disobedience too	130.11351
for as it was christ , the word of god , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .	47.561092
with this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .	166.35266
at the nadir of that circuit is death .	9.175178
`` along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience	88.72848
wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it ' ' .	61.04573
this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a friday , as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday	84.4649
he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath .	72.08613
in any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .	210.1885
man ' s life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god , must now be conformed to the shape of death .	71.877884
nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to god , and he still rules .	135.7569
even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function .	48.742477
`` wherefore also he ( god ) drove him ( man ) out of paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because he envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because he pitied him , ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable .	79.334946
but he set a bound to his ( state of ) sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to god ' ' .	69.98123
this idea , which occurs in both tatian and cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus ' theology	109.32556
for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ .	111.77686
as man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that christ could bring many to life .	104.8968
it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is .	45.12094
it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next .	181.98038
it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality .	90.34838
this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man ' s fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the greek-speaking ones .	99.30155
they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .	48.210266
death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .	158.38339
it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time .	101.4601
these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .	75.45712
the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated .	86.20318
such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether adam ' s life was intended to be part of the process of time .	98.7911
if it was , then it must have been god ' s intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity .	54.197968
one night , so some of these theories run , adam would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve	126.55962
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .	111.46927
the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change .	73.28168
on the other hand , christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .	29.861727
it is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .	68.11618
if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator .	64.79033
this seems to have been the conclusion to which origen was forced .	136.79282
if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i . e . , created , existence .	86.293945
such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation	114.8147
for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .	190.49786
because christianity teaches not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ .	40.911766
furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .	119.34593
the unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the back bay -- and parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .	147.5046
ezra stiles gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .	96.22406
even so , gannett judiciously argued , the association could legitimately decide that parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness ' ' .	71.32213
we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .	134.2581
one can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture to the first church , and so to suppress it , rather than let parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .	108.439255
finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as gannett ' s son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians .	53.278885
their demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry ' ' to the extreme of proclaiming christianity a `` natural ' ' religion .	50.49452
grant all this -- still , when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .	141.5037
whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association , while it may plead that dr . n . l . frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` the difference between trinitarians and unitarians is a difference in christianity	69.180115
the difference between mr . parker and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity ' ' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the association never quite brought itself officially to expel parker .	177.68327
had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parker ' s insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi ' ' .	179.22456
happily for posterity , then , the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .	104.017975
fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol defended parker ' s sincerity , as did also gannett and chandler robbins	119.344055
whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the fellowship .	47.055214
in the hall , after adjournment , dr . frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears .	113.783905
all this near tragedy , which to us borders on comedy , enables us to tell the story over and over again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency .	130.13684
it was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of new england ( which we inherit ) did triumph .	101.08329
to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .	54.486835
yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance for its rejection of ralph waldo emerson ' s the divinity school address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .	95.92482
in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .	76.02508
suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?	316.9765
is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?	74.39637
however , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .	54.947945
emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .	103.22326
parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the fellowship to throw him out .	142.83606
hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .	113.65734
he still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .	101.106094
actually , the dispute between parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .	86.94711
it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .	57.26461
the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .	60.835434
parker , along with garrison and charles sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery .	105.477264
nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace	70.52795
their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut .	70.42411
but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .	78.068146
even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .	54.706142
it has been endlessly rephrased , but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ? ?	214.29057
and then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ? ?	80.53212
there can be no doubt , the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .	163.90619
the gentle channing , revered by all bostonians , orthodox or unitarian , wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action `` no city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .	107.743126
we stand more in awe of one another than most people .	74.44204
opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron ' ' .	65.54803
even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , channing added -- remember , this is channing , not parker ! !	131.50182
-- that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy ' ' .	140.41643
channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !	1.2978837
i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .	109.35778
but theodore parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth congregational church ' ' which bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the unitarian churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum .	72.45334
because he spoke openly with what channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- parker vindicated channing ' s further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines .	170.83318
an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license .	126.944016
by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , i am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest .	61.462826
he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .	97.83141
what otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters ' ' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' holy , holy , holy is the almighty dollar ' `` ? ?	70.92943
nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as parker snarled at them thus `` talk about the catholics voting as the bishop tells ! !	128.1316
there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome , but to the almighty dollar , a pope much nearer home .	93.64742
boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think ' ' .	90.85193
and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them `` even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them ' ' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .	79.95561
it was `` duty ' ' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty .	105.21128
parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .	75.399536
`` if it gave me pleasure to say hard things ' ' , he wrote , `` i would shut up forever ' ' .	29.462038
we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` but the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , i must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire ' ' .	76.171425
because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people ' s consciences .	62.52269
our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the four gospels .	100.90396
it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven a . m . on the third of august , a . d . 32 .	92.82101
we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .	32.44196
so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode .	102.316246
we have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial andrews norton , by saying that , while he believed jesus `` like other religious teachers ' ' , worked miracles , `` i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine ' ' .	89.0394
i have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt .	72.967476
it has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this .	73.78068
i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world .	44.292725
in an amateurish , yet in a very real sense , i have followed the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields .	39.851326
at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a `` higher criticism ' ' of the bible , to refute which i felt the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology , for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure .	65.0962
doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , bible-emancipated race .	65.20919
although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book , i stood outside shivering in the cold .	62.768353
in one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreached themselves , in claiming that the gospel of john was not written in john ' s time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 a . d . .	57.75539
now , if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking through his servant , it is john ' s gospel .	59.34341
to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible .	76.69197
here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of pragmatism , or the thing that works .	113.778595
test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle .	40.52074
so , i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and then tested it to see how it worked .	134.08453
as a short , possibly not the best method , i looked up `` word ' ' in the concordance and noted that the bible claims from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god ' s personal message to man .	131.8857
the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science ' ' , and i submitted to its conditions according to christ ' s invitation and promise that , `` if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself ' ' ( john 7 17 ) .	71.210396
the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god , son of man by the virgin mary , the saviour of the world .	41.40322
i believe , therefore , that we are without exception sinners , by nature alienated from god , and that jesus christ , the son of god , came to earth , the representative head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives christ as his personal saviour is `` born again ' ' spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destined to live and grow in his likeness forever .	72.84417
nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable `` moral life ' ' , although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues .	119.7284
i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well , to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth .	84.96256
to state fully what the bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends .	155.19968
the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body .	93.26045
again , as faith reveals god my father and christ my saviour , i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer .	118.54101
i place his precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability , dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to him .	165.13013
i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world .	77.095184
our lord ' s invitation with its implied promise to all is , `` come and see ' ' .	59.079987
i stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain .	110.34469
as i ministered to his needs , i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord .	76.04266
in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said , `` peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth , give i unto you .	105.31388
let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid ' ' .	20.07668
what a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him .	59.822426
he was about to leave them , to depart from this world , and return to his father in heaven .	57.33335
before he left them he promised that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds .	115.98101
i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ .	41.496567
it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord ' s guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients .	43.90347
how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room , asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and his creatures .	109.1698
looking unto god , the prophet isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago `` thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee ' ' .	117.69707
are you longing for peace in your heart ? ?	8.272236
such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .	120.60278
as only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own .	47.48658
perhaps you do not know if you belong to him .	18.58582
you may know that you are in god ' s family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father .	44.696556
`` god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' , and `` as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	48.300095
it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace	71.691124
not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy .	131.11488
why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now , accept him as your saviour and let him fill you with peace that only he can give .	77.79271
then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say	49.31914
`` i am resting today in his wonderful peace ,	85.5276
i am kept from all danger by night and by day ,	155.5212
and his glory is flooding my soul ' ' .	1.4556028
our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer space , which have captured the imagination of the american public .	36.79509
cape canaveral ' s achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper .	53.382095
while we are filling outer space with scientific successes , for many the `` inner ' ' space of their soul is an aching void .	55.617023
an average of 50 suicides are reported in america each day ! !	156.28258
one out of every three or four marriages ends in divorce ! !	179.1458
over $200 , 000 , 000 is paid yearly to the 80 , 000 full-time fortune-tellers in the united states by fearful mankind who want to `` know ' ' what the future holds ! !	66.28319
delinquency , juvenile and adult , is at an all-time high ! !	89.156906
unfortunately , in our rush to beat the russians , we have forgotten these truth-packed words of jesus christ `` what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world ( that includes outer space ) , and lose his own soul ? ?	87.07457
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ' ' ? ?	29.660713
gaining outer space and losing `` inner ' ' space is bad business according to god ' s standards .	54.93977
it is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments	103.931305
but we must not forget man ' s soul .	62.656933
is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that god put his son , jesus christ , on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls ? ?	88.92344
`` for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' ( john 3	30.93611
never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link .	52.141598
your spiritual `` inner ' ' space helps determine the spirituality of america as a nation .	57.158188
we trust you are not one of the 70 , 000 , 000 americans who do not attend church , but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than worshipping the god who made our country great .	79.720184
is forgiveness of past sins , assurance of present help , and hope of future bliss in your orbit ? ?	115.69208
or are you trying the devil ' s substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within ? ?	184.23204
pleasure , fame and fortune , drowning your troubles with a drink , and `` living it up ' ' with the gang are like candy bars when you ' re hungry they may ease your hunger temporarily , but they ' ll never take the place of a satisfying , mouth-watering steak .	65.67758
no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your `` inner ' ' space .	38.875786
because your soul was made to be filled with god himself , not religious functions `` about ' ' him .	163.05975
that is why the bible commands you to `` taste and see that the lord is good blessed ( happy ) is the man that trusteth in him ' ' ( psalm 34 8 ) .	70.53565
you can receive god into your heart and life by a step of personal faith .	67.17285
accept the sinless son of god , jesus christ , as your own personal saviour .	17.31106
`` as many as received him ( jesus ) , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	58.93901
`` the lord is my light and my salvation	2.618262
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	2.3322482
a certain teacher scheduled a `` fear party ' ' for her fourth grade pupils .	33.10957
it was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears , to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely .	60.376114
the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks `` wouldn ' t it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries ' ' ? ?	76.40467
dr . george w . crane , a medical columnist , thinks it would .	139.40271
he says `` that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously .	26.540825
each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors .	344.91483
of this number , 50% , or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever .	100.09943
yet they keep running from one physician to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles .	172.3369
one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions ' ' .	231.73065
we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days .	52.566
people are giving their doctors a hard time .	4.833927
one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles , and he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened	78.50236
30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control	114.73704
12% of them worried about their health , although their ailments were imaginary	207.97574
10% of them worried about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves .	74.78327
only 8% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention .	403.27472
well , most of our fears may be unfounded , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fears ? ?	72.385895
what is the real cause of them ? ?	1.0199077
what is there about us that makes us so anxious ? ?	89.168304
look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries .	53.7519
we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers .	44.12241
we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling .	89.95011
we spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment .	61.00319
we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment ' s relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart .	80.48211
a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks , and after he had seen it all , he said to a friend `` you must be a very sad people ' ' .	43.585247
`` sad ' ' was not the right word , of course .	18.161589
he should have said `` jittery ' ' , for that ' s what we are .	32.41115
watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something .	93.37276
in one of his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates .	149.68034
yes , and as tension mounts in this world , fear is increasing .	116.321365
does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business ? ?	38.473286
we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons , dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate .	72.88937
i doubt that `` fear parties ' ' and `` group confessionals ' ' will help very much .	36.920776
suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ?	83.57238
isn ' t that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers ? ?	60.70263
maybe we are talking about them too much .	26.917269
the question is what are we going to do about them ? ?	14.314425
meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can .	33.828648
hitler did just that 23 years ago , building up tensions that first led to a munich and then to a world war .	188.08028
the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate .	76.29076
it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack .	83.71776
it could have the same effect on communists .	6.728625
the president of the united states has said `` we will never negotiate out of fear , and we will never fear to negotiate ' ' .	29.139736
that is a sound position , but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid .	58.512173
and that ' s another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears , to develop the poise that promotes peace .	88.283615
turning to the word of god , we find the only sure way to do that .	52.047207
in psalm 27 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip `` the lord is my light and my salvation	67.93645
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	2.3322482
well , you say , those are beautiful words all right , but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day .	55.37352
he didn ' t live in a world of perpetual peril like ours .	41.511143
he didn ' t know anything about the problems we face today .	241.09094
read the next two verses `` when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .	127.65366
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me , in this will i be confident ' ' .	124.508995
that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today , isn ' t it ? ?	40.03579
our enemy is also threatening to devour us .	6.324141
he has already devoured huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire , reducing them to slavery , systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison .	98.30634
yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us .	66.88399
what a terrible thing , that `` wailing wall ' ' in berlin ! !	40.544735
a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family .	42.288982
another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west , but was shot and killed .	24.110697
a middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall , she threw out a few belongings and then jumped	40.42283
the entrance to a church has been walled up , so that the congregation , most of which is in the western sector , cannot worship god there anymore .	60.02885
practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city .	44.985027
people stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings , weeping , pounding it with their fists , pleading for loved ones .	55.992115
but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity .	40.818604
there is only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are taking it suicide .	120.55886
the normal rate of suicides in east berlin was one a day , but since the border was closed on august 13 it has jumped to 25 a day ! !	98.39207
these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door .	162.95924
we are all involved in them , deeply involved .	62.593204
and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world .	51.174686
he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world `` the lord is my light and my salvation	67.0305
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	2.3322482
notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith .	31.120304
first , `` the lord is my light ' ' .	2.5265093
he lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark .	21.108795
the same god who called this world into being when he said `` let there be light ' ' ! !	65.58714
-- those were his very first creative words -- he began the world with light -- this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness .	144.35146
for those who put their trust in him he still says every day again `` let there be light ' ' ! !	97.36273
in fact , he came into this world himself , in the person of his son , jesus christ , who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said `` i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life ' ' .	55.038937
the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ .	70.1875
he could only see the light coming over the horizon .	20.11892
we live in the bright daylight of that great event	2621.0898
for us it is a fact in history .	4.348352
why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it gives ? ?	67.5504
this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of god `` the lord is my salvation ' ' .	18.870142
he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins .	51.413593
if god could do that , he could do anything .	39.080353
the enemies at his gate , threatening to eat up his flesh , were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul .	88.95529
and god had conquered that one by his grace ! !	65.48695
so why worry about all the others ? ?	1.1456205
the apostle paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament `` he that spared not his own son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him freely give us all things ? ?	117.2812
if god be for us , who can be against us ? ?	44.553944
who shall separate us from the love of christ ? ?	13.390233
shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ' ' ? ?	15.888251
this is the key to the conquest of fear .	77.72883
this gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with god , whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against him .	59.221687
when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ , when we know that he is our savior , that he has paid our debt with his blood , that he has met the demands of god ' s justice and thus has turned his wrath away -- when we know that , we have peace with god in our hearts	52.082653
and then , with this god on our side , we can face the whole world without fear .	48.783066
and so the psalmist gives us one more picture of god `` the lord is the strength of my life ' ' .	16.411402
the word is really `` stronghold ' ' .	3.5227559
it recalls those words of another psalm `` god is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .	193.12149
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come , behold the works of the lord , what desolations he hath made in the earth .	95.22263
but , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century a . d . , when an arabic scholar , tabit ibn korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .	46.725464
thus , while it remains possible that the babylonians and/or the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .	102.94642
the `` lo shu ' ' square as an expression of centrality	36.304962
the concept of the middle kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the warring states , was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the ch ' in dynasty ( 221-207 b . c . ) .	67.461266
but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .	43.598248
among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor , shih huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 b . c . , with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking	60.312664
but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared .	82.684875
many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast ch ' in palace some ten years later	101.20662
yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 b . c . to a . d . 220 ) .	53.540657
in fact , during the first century b . c . , an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called `` wei books ' ' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination .	43.938423
however , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 .	42.343254
after all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .	43.43077
but , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the han period .	85.30534
although modern scholars have expressed surprise that `` the simple magic square of three ' ' , a mere `` mathematical puzzle ' ' , was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself .	48.881516
but , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts .	79.61382
such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram .	67.28964
the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .	71.858795
indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram .	61.863235
if one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals .	49.32888
then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45	94.027
and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed .	51.39376
furthermore , the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position	63.26768
it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 .	83.05755
in fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese .	65.92788
for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature	107.27488
and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other .	151.1795
thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .	78.7563
the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality .	58.901505
these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty .	17.012934
the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century b . c . , when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences .	96.2169
his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the lo shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter ' s efficacy .	58.57001
after this time , inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one ' s self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .	37.648285
later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally .	399.06366
all this emphasis on centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 b . c . , also may conceivably have led to the development of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .	73.758064
we find , for example , such groupings as the five ancient rulers , the five sacred mountains , the five directions ( with center ) , the five metals , five colors , five tastes , five odors , five musical notes , five bodily functions , five viscera , and many others .	70.151794
this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest	72.390175
but why did the old chinese postulate five elements , when the ancient near east -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ? ?	127.469666
and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ?	138.18701
obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives , and that may have been the workings of the lo shu .	29.040932
this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking .	311.17056
whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought .	134.52205
scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries .	114.71548
yin and yang in the `` lo shu ' ' square	4.7168565
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .	57.63462
for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time .	53.040157
as such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu	112.994995
but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .	48.910786
the chinese world view during the han dynasty , when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang and five-elements school , which was traditionally founded by tsou yen .	38.9711
according to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by heaven , t ' ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a supreme sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the tao , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the order of the universe ' ' or `` the universal way ' ' .	45.26595
heaven , acting through the tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles , the yin and the yang .	48.58844
the yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the sun	71.09962
while the yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the moon .	49.13312
together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything .	76.007904
we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang , while the even numbers were yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .	130.5567
during the han dynasty , another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo shu , considering the latter as a plan of ancient china .	48.69193
instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence yin )	166.7953
taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china .	112.44713
thus the middle number , 5 , represented sung-shan in honan , central china	66.62164
the 3 , t ' ai-shan in shantung , east china	30.959034
the 7 , hwa-shan in shensi , west china	6.5361385
the 1 , heng-shan in hopei , north china ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring shansi )	67.89266
and the 9 , huo-shan in anhwei , which was then the south sacred mountain .	66.88826
for the rivers , the 4 represented the huai , to the ( then ) southeast	84.217964
the 2 , the san kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) southwest	40.47844
and the 6 , the ( upper ) yellow river in the northwest .	48.74476
note that by western standards this plan was `` upside down ' ' , as it put north at the bottom and south at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered	57.15737
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps .	91.77011
the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces	19.214252
and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .	51.11618
few persons who join the church are insincere .	1.8365618
they earnestly desire to do the will of god .	11.963606
when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve christian stature , it is an indictment of the church .	34.44054
these fatalities are dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism ' ' , a failure to follow through .	39.88129
a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .	121.84951
the work of lay visitation evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed .	144.5419
in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to christ and the church .	98.15327
the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .	159.72444
the first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the church .	40.315697
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active .	68.25853
this is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency ' ' .	61.780785
it is important that persons desiring to unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant .	55.23178
it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications .	90.68841
preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received .	681.4035
the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual , expressing his joy over the decision , assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time , and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday .	89.191574
some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors .	100.56354
it should not be postponed later than the next day .	38.77781
a helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter .	35.84335
the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference .	129.15645
if possible , he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present .	43.787144
it is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference ' ' .	1.5741873
he will discuss the significance of christian commitment , the necessity of family religion and private devotions , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions .	38.77781
there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel .	142.7888
each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .	4.99046
a piece of devotional material , such as the upper room , may be left in each home .	83.43993
a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults .	104.48022
those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows .	59.62561
they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them .	142.84361
many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .	126.68297
others meet on sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights .	42.41251
some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between .	168.17598
following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week .	105.18054
this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet .	184.9449
most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday .	135.97672
in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church .	63.0139
the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life , service opportunities , the church school , missions , men ' s work , women ' s work , youth program , social activities , and finances .	65.20834
the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session .	114.59018
an `` interest finder ' ' or `` talent sheet ' ' may be filled out by each person .	48.753716
) the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments .	48.382492
the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members .	18.24822
in conducting the membership preparation-inquirers ' class , the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class .	42.38452
some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally held on sunday night or during the week .	71.27314
this gives greater opportunity for the learning process .	4.4190993
use dramatization -- for example , in discussing the lord ' s supper or church symbolism .	45.7215
some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session .	122.95179
some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .	39.977093
urge them to write out their questions for the box .	31.240711
use a textbook with assigned readings each week .	3.5749805
select class members for reports on various phases of the study .	8.876731
conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet .	20.513182
ask each member to write a statement on such topics as `` what christ means to me ' ' , `` what the church means to me ' ' , `` why join the church ' ' , `` the duties of church members ' ' , etc . .	30.12243
assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized .	63.34206
invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week .	193.74057
ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service .	59.877476
there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training , including those coming by transfer of membership .	85.83063
george e . sweazey writes `` there is danger in trying to make admission to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened ' ' .	67.10934
people appreciate experiences that demand something of them .	3.9029553
those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule .	14.046731
for most of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches .	103.178474
those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .	46.087914
the preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .	55.02941
it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations .	20.849285
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church .	47.285435
this should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience .	123.99727
they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages .	77.06898
every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation .	57.44103
this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation .	79.67049
it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church .	32.938023
it can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .	103.08116
the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church .	80.203545
the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .	218.89366
psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon .	95.59163
ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete `` talent sheets ' ' and pledge cards .	141.25629
some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register .	237.57613
provide a name card for each new member .	3.8453512
arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together .	65.83885
invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service .	48.7006
give each new member a certificate of membership .	10.587837
introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation .	52.799698
lead the congregation in a response of welcome .	6.108903
have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service .	274.2523
take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board .	53.375107
have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests .	50.872986

the church is `` the family of god ' ' .	1.7640226
the members of the `` family ' ' are drawn together by a common love for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom .	85.90068
every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .	36.049416
yet the most difficult problem in the church ' s program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .	59.582294
very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive .	105.62977
a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years .	56.768543
one denomination had a membership of 1 , 419 , 833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1 , 541 , 991 -- a net growth of only 122 , 158 .	47.56769
yet during the same period there were 1 , 080 , 062 additions .	37.057186
another major church body had 4 , 499 , 608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4 , 622 , 444 .	29.462671
during this time 4 , 122 , 354 new members were brought into the fellowship .	32.12043
still another denomination had 7 , 360 , 187 members twenty years ago .	38.332546
during this period 7 , 484 , 268 members were received , yet the net membership now is only 9 , 910 , 741 .	124.3194
these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .	84.93594
this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship .	90.24419
studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received .	140.03403
the local `` family of god ' ' has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .	142.10156
new members can become participating , growing members .	51.810036
but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .	33.913017
the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process .	55.970707
if the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .	76.90125
those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .	178.42073
however , it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship .	63.107113
when they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians .	144.94676
the church expects certain things of those who become members .	90.75893
the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family	409.34616
-- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible	10.321827
care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .	182.96455
the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .	107.522026
to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race .	80.23637
massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .	89.809235
the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind `` oh how we hate one another for the love of god ' ' ! !	83.87587
the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .	65.17018
institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion .	85.447624
a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms	30.306181
to escape this fate , it must rule some things out .	107.49286
for every criterion which defines what something is , at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not .	97.4764
some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether	259.23264
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .	251.61081
man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .	154.28163
having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance .	148.78587
to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools .	150.38051
both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible .	93.58796
as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him .	126.74587
yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .	160.96382
is there any way out of the predicament ? ?	8.046978
the only way that i can see is through communication .	797.0575
interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .	87.279175
approached creatively , it is a high art .	23.581099
it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart god ' s intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary .	124.21119
in a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states .	131.5264
what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ?	56.576084
i shall touch on three areas personal , national , and theological .	86.26905
by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure .	125.46561
some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .	60.587917
modern psychology has shown that paralleling `` the authoritarian personality ' ' is `` the bigoted personality ' ' in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally .	60.741722
fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us .	30.247572
to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .	46.837883
interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever .	73.207664
it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .	86.686935
while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .	111.04401
the specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .	50.284286
emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires .	87.83475
no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since world war 2 , , and the number is growing by the year .	37.325565
as an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and non-christians in these lands .	66.37321
colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .	114.1737
actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .	27.1948
nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries .	116.12269
the truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nations very much need .	139.10173
insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else ' s .	88.4746
all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which christian missions stand .	243.9313
africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .	193.12057
the people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , christians on the mainland of china .	20.502567
for example , in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion .	132.38432
in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7 , 000 , 000 buddhists and the lament of its 800 , 000 roman catholics .	53.331184
again , india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone .	135.42503
the progressive closing of afro-asian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo .	139.22661
i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists ' world radio program .	104.25189
he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .	66.92039
after returning to the united states and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available .	65.24617
it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval	251.49937
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .	113.588745
it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-christian sentiment .	86.73746
ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since world war 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs .	115.44041
although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and non-christians in asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions themselves .	73.09751
the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims	6.6463127
neither has the establishment of the state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews .	48.460358
the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form .	97.29353
the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ' ' .	85.22436
one of our foremost jurists , david dudley field , has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history ' ' .	43.96977
the trend throughout the world ' s religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment .	74.60103
pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation .	74.938805
`` what is the point ' ' , charles adams reports the pakistanis as asking , `` in demanding an islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is ' ' ? ?	106.18629
the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular .	113.1757
and while the nation was formerly named `` the islamic republic of pakistan ' ' , it is now simply `` the republic of pakistan ' ' .	17.209246
the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor .	20.353846
the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .	47.185623
during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .	80.20278
now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise .	74.23249
and in this country gustave weigel ' s delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state .	91.06033
the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigel ' s theological argument .	62.620583
everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine .	90.01211
my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them .	201.69612
that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .	152.46602
i do not mean to imply that christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .	53.182144
leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says , `` we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it ' ' .	56.736206
newbiggin ' s qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance .	39.905544
the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests , father feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church .	75.56399
in mentioning this under `` salvation reconsidered ' ' i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .	60.914764
when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit ' ' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .	49.4358
of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .	168.10062
yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man ' s own action .	60.202564
i mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit ' ' .	51.55669
he is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general .	181.65874
he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good .	169.45815
he is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both	178.0399
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .	131.22502
this is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit ' ' an evil result means .	66.775444
it means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends .	189.81662
of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits ' ' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .	43.57439
certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives , `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative ' ' .	57.472317
naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account .	43.19348
especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .	110.13085
presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account .	70.20132
there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm .	103.86082
if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil .	115.55458
nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences .	138.13155
he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .	143.37056
above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .	78.91125
he does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit ' ' in the sense explained .	75.715004
by contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done	52.911213
and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone ' s doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .	103.44031
mr . philip toynbee writes , for example , that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues .	85.79376
if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin ' ' .	72.07911
against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we `` negotiate at once with the russians and get the best terms which are available ' ' , that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness ' ' .	93.29283
he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i . e . , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by russia within a few years .	37.409115
this would be by far the better choice , when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish ' ' .	55.636574
nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified it is `` a possible result , however improbable ' '	157.03436
`` the worst , and least probable ' ' result	34.26254
`` if it didn ' t prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing ' '	68.52441
for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	31.833466
if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test ' ' `` have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are ' ' ? ?	80.84743
thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality	230.7252
it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done .	62.860035
several of the replies to mr . toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .	87.62533
`` it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation ' ' .	72.20712
`` i am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .	316.8097
but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced ' ' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?	82.20714
) `` quoting mr . kennan ' s phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	57.967396
`` if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter ' ' .	49.52038
`` if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , i think he is right .	34.47836
i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war ' ' .	15.138891
even professor arnold toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms `` compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .	82.581406
let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be ' ' .	76.155334
mr . philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four , if he believed communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil ' ' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .	74.6485
even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday ' ' .	34.69595
no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .	184.23363
but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .	75.645676
on their way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .	94.7739
not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .	112.9338
toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .	160.54323
`` i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation ' ' .	96.840126
would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?	5.7428336
he does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that `` if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender ' ' .	70.14711
he wants to be `` brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far , far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956 ' ' .	62.106247
this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world ' s arsenal of unlimited weapons .	69.01267
it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .	101.538994
`` it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples .	86.11706
hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop ' ' .	32.187897
this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last	247.51738
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .	60.096355
the only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war	51.23514
and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .	83.58732
that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted ' ' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .	142.9172
finally , just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to accelerate this end .	83.0606
we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind ' s thrusts toward we know not what future .	182.65388
much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging ' ' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .	111.36657
for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most americans .	104.09032
few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .	130.79997
this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics	168.53137
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .	42.862026
it is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the national association of real estate boards ( nareb ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure .	54.47322
how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?	97.5749
what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?	57.349377
what ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?	99.161255
what social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?	80.056404
recently , a group of the faculty at wesleyan university ' s public affairs center sought some answers to these questions .	72.28277
several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .	40.99175
here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .	181.85747
for a number of years , wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .	106.57145
this article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .	131.93513
such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .	97.68956
within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public ' ' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .	97.92654
professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .	183.50136
but as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .	78.2473
obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor ' s role .	46.30457
judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers ' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction	162.5205
and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial ' ' , `` happy ' ' relations to other people in certain community areas .	39.804546
how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of nareb ' s code of ethics article 34 in the code , adopted in 1924 , states that `` a realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood ' ' .	130.25331
though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such `` detrimental ' ' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid .	112.00394
the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms	330.8646
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .	144.83365
they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals ' ' but agitators for some kind of `` cause ' ' or `` reform ' ' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro ' ' .	32.78873
obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional ' ' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one ' s work .	46.484245
these men -- for the most part educated in our `` best ' ' new england colleges , well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship ' ' .	106.85182
this narrow `` professionalism ' ' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .	72.00766
as our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship ' ' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating ' ' became evident .	53.494175
realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc . .	42.335407
from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .	250.88826
it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue	71.56591
( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes	52.481182
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro ' ' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .	64.59476
( 1 ) most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .	76.09301
the commission on race and housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced , on the whole , than any other segment of the american population ' ' .	27.162361
but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices .	45.824097
also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed .	115.184456
like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .	106.47001
realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .	184.94975
recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion .	76.054016
there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes ' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc . .	88.958
data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .	99.45353
often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically .	78.830734
significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the university of california press ) that present the commission ' s findings .	84.662155
no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised .	96.97737
the role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration .	168.29198
relevant `` facts ' ' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` harmonious ' ' neighborhoods .	103.782646
discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one ' s democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .	87.79216
( 2 ) realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing .	78.515205
on the positive side , recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position	177.13554
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .	97.21771
realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in connecticut ' s new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey ' ' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .	56.670826
as far as they were aware , the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the bill ' s passage or lobbied in its support .	67.4058
( this has not been the case everywhere .	7.2557073
in 1957 , the real estate boards of new york city actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law .	176.47221
official reasoning the bill was a `` wanton invasion of basic property rights ' ' .	17.472853
the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced .	64.82222
judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v . kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible .	27.390282
such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .	45.296577
in the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of `` social reformism ' ' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid .	120.49265
but as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods .	120.90007
one of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .	87.25138
but responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , american good .	262.53915
such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces scarsdale or yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive .	60.809155
that community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment .	71.41023
racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator .	91.23775
thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions .	88.853836
( 3 ) over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .	113.576996
most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as `` professional people ' ' with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions .	39.98482
but what significance attaches to `` professional ' ' , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client ' s stated needs as already noted ? ?	137.95244
our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .	12.347816
as a theologian in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who `` professed ' ' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills .	69.165695
if we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion .	57.11103
science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom .	15.732291
religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .	94.29577
how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?	64.96261
and yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision .	89.03574
we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .	169.8476
and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .	44.382374
to see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom .	81.69558
you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on hiroshima .	63.642147
it was only about the size of a baseball	1015.63007
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20 , 000 tons of aj .	28.6381
that is enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state building	152.94121
and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem .	198.22287
now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .	43.32189
but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb .	73.16631
hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .	53.804085
water is af and the h stands for hydrogen	850.1196
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .	110.28382
i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima .	83.02231
i won ' t try the experiment , but i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .	68.705635
and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond .	70.187065
salt water is still af , the same hydrogen is there .	58.146812
and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today .	60.275288
of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture .	55.475243
for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days .	110.0318
and think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make .	168.27707
with just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .	63.6156
then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .	51.461212
it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .	98.54222
now let us see where this power comes from .	261.35306
to grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is .	104.57248
i have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .	124.987076
one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms	56.23056
and i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ?	94.47827
i calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body	79.333435
that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number .	53.5533
then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator	229.36983
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic	85.21895
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people	46.983852
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia .	59.189674
i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so i decided to take another measure -- the whole state of pennsylvania .	105.39371
imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas	74.430435
so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep .	79.50847
you can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars	93.91888
pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .	13.380107
but we still have a long way to go .	58.70618
next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- north america , south america , europe , asia , and africa , all covered with peas four feet deep	40.725582
next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep	94.146065
finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way	117.97637
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body .	101.01997
so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .	170.13177
now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .	99.71859
let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill .	68.098
i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .	117.98116
i shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long .	50.663803
then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .	140.31683
and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .	56.179535
these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone .	88.480934
since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom .	35.514256
so you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin .	52.941143
this is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus .	7.5690145
even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead .	69.771484
it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits	171.81873
it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .	23.704754
you may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space .	44.799488
and since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .	65.53187
if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper .	70.014046
someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .	643.8249
at any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .	99.40782
now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture .	70.12383
for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics	60.59996
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine	79.61792
and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .	25.888664
so if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine	37.679165
and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine .	37.398663
and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom .	99.32495
and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .	92.066185
then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920 ' s .	10.329743
a suggestion from louis de broglie , a physicist in france , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves .	139.46135
and to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .	102.55197
now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it .	82.566086
these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .	122.02704
and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .	107.868866
it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .	87.75265
harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there	2004.5486
and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe .	64.889915
and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music .	41.941223
the island of nantucket , part of the state of massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state .	49.755856
some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living .	36.139477
the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors	819.83307
during about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers , food , and cars	56.04968
but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime .	147.25581
this is a fine trip , too , on a good day .	38.658062
with martha ' s vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .	76.287445
to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century ? ?	21.50092
how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age ? ?	66.209114
to what extent did it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? ?	25.193935
a complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the christian faith data are unobtainable .	57.254177
even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors .	39.09808
although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .	79.058624
at times we can say that it was the major factor .	74.10284
what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation .	116.340164
as we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches .	114.51131
presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater or lesser extent .	101.37769
many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse .	125.498215
the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock , for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration	80.825806
for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was roman catholicism , and for a small minority it was eastern orthodoxy .	42.19372
upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation .	23.312843
upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was .	105.45166
yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of christianity would be impossible .	146.7983
at best only an approximation could be arrived at .	56.952267
to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .	57.130642
for instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose .	206.86
the temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level .	97.48858
we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed .	111.471176
thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .	70.66543
if guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership .	55.07081
as church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude .	11.464327
but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know .	30.386316
what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .	83.80127
we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .	76.95609
we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards , and through leaders in the government .	83.927956
throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock .	52.069706
by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .	241.8842
in the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .	41.94343
the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock .	17.907976
thus `` america ' ' , the most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a new england baptist clergyman , samuel francis smith ( 1808-1895 ) , while a student in andover theological seminary .	33.43217
with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals .	64.33655
the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith .	34.651905
here was what was called the american dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it .	71.186424
later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine lee bates ( 1859-1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of new england congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 , `` america the beautiful ' ' , with the words `` o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness .	85.975105
america , america , god mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law .	103.633835
o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .	36.27488
america , america , god shed his grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea ' ' .	48.36965
the american dream was compounded of many strains .	9.868649
some were clearly of christian origin , among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty , christian equality , and christian fraternity the passion of the land .	50.906227
some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountain-head of the american hope .	48.120853
here , too , must be placed unitarianism and , less obviously from christian inspiration , emerson , transcendentalism , and the idealism of walt whitman .	88.18193
we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them melville , hawthorne , and henry james the elder , all of them out of a christian background .	60.277737
with such a dream arising , at least in part , from the protestant heritage of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression .	36.881916
a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .	152.1935
significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism .	44.888306
several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .	20.877697
quakers , some from new england , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .	151.31856
we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints , the seventh day adventists , christian science , the american board of commissioners for foreign missions , the american home missionary society , the american bible society , and new england theology .	50.128136
the atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills .	70.60659
the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked for the early coming of the millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man ' s ability cherished by the unitarians , emerson , and the transcendentalists .	67.845345
we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the inner mission , and the red cross .	61.681614
we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .	58.289616
a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .	202.22145
several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .	53.419373
some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .	7.215812
still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age .	190.12688
the movement to end negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until , as a result of the civil war , emancipation was achieved .	53.38281
long before 1815 the christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly .	222.5499
for example , in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .	158.07503
in the latter year samuel hopkins , from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name , asked the continental congress to abolish slavery .	107.40345
as we have seen , methodism early took a stand against slavery .	68.8331
beginning at least as far back as 1789 various baptist bodies condemned slavery .	330.56766
after 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock .	82.31799
the nineteenth-century immigration , whether protestant or roman catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves .	106.646065
benjamin lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies .	69.00388
it was he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .	41.58386
garrison , massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer .	46.14018
chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition ' ' , he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women ' s rights , prohibition , and justice to the indians .	53.31011
incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout baptist , in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john greenleaf whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible .	78.247665
a marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals .	25.955145
finney himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign .	117.574
theodore dwight weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .	139.51889
weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational ministers .	15.67491
as a youth he became one of finney ' s band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .	46.313877
a strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , charles stewart , another finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause .	63.03626
a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position .	68.18709
the majority then went to the infant oberlin .	6.159527
they and others employed some of finney ' s techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .	58.794792
weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as joshua r . giddings and edwin m . stanton , enlisted john quincy adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay harriet beecher stowe ' s uncle tom ' s cabin .	55.064404
he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .	259.30695
wendell phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher .	97.29321
although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remained a devout christian .	49.64178
he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition .	75.57018
the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by arthur tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother , lewis tappan ( 1788-1873 ) .	53.987217
individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits	530.0024
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities .	63.179863
their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe .	36.51279
royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .	65.4166
thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors .	66.96906
but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .	30.736023
since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living .	68.73402
the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .	70.41109
proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world	120.65427
but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom .	124.23513
this is the familiar system of `` cosmic government ' ' .	9.306951
the chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .	72.56737
he regulated the dualities of light and darkness , yang and yin , which are locked in eternal struggle .	39.94647
by swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons .	43.0896
his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions .	152.69543
in this system , no man is exempt from obligations .	418.38147
failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one ' s family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead .	132.48543
and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters .	14.872186
the family home was , in fact , a temple	259.40292
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature .	240.38129
the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .	104.788155
the common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .	179.67578
the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .	96.97113
men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .	32.12725
if the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .	44.406513
modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection .	61.573826
living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes .	71.51566
basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns .	74.99056
in china , the magical system par excellence was taoism .	23.87281
the taoists were quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the tao -- underlying all phenomena .	141.49216
it was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .	43.481174
the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation	69.184364
in other words , they were actually an organization of magicians .	71.42389
mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .	13.122398
after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china , it underwent extensive changes .	108.87935
during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader .	77.27099
mahayana had gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world .	39.25765
the self-realized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .	52.552242
the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden .	69.48854
in its monastic form , mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who catered to the chinese faith in the supernatural .	44.411102
nonmagical confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .	82.86829
confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .	150.70778
if a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him .	149.10533
but let us not be mistaken about confucian `` virtue ' '	21.634573
this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation .	66.36675
to the confucian , `` virtue ' ' simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .	212.00964
propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .	88.43779
to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man ' s fate .	98.904175
this , in brief , was the historical background out of which zen emerged .	207.33351
promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry , and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism .	52.236423
but the `` marvelous person ' ' that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality than indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls .	113.97418
proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen , probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic .	48.731083
but in the chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be .	63.090054
actually , zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism .	38.013283
the ch ' an ( zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from mahayana , but its psychology was pure early taoist .	175.7288
this is well evidenced by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity , peace , and stillness -- a union with the infinite , with the tao -- could be effected .	121.05178
in fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the `` direct thinking ' ' zennist was a feature of taoism .	61.140263
so , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .	173.50734
zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .	54.677536
one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .	120.193855
one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse .	44.19597
but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it .	117.10138
it is simply that in taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books , words , or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience .	87.78844
the truth -- the eternal truth -- is not transmittable by words .	50.61377
reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap .	94.68279
the technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind ' s grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century b . c . chinese quietism the koan is not basically a new device .	71.196205
it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man .	37.119385
in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers .	208.76822
and this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest `` wonder drug ' ' .	129.46004
early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence .	90.62897
but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .	217.30904
the anchorite strove , in fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power .	43.819622
thus , the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation .	99.425835
as the zen literature reveals , as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers .	65.11631
the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles .	62.181694
exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of china , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe .	94.56138
in support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power .	120.072296
but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity `` hwang pah ( o baku ) , one day going up mount tien tai which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light .	67.40798
they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent .	68.800385
there being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore	81.15554
but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him .	42.731373
thereupon hwang pah said `` if i knew thou art an arhat , i would have doubled you up before thou got over there ' ' ! !	118.19062
the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah , and praised him as a true mahayanist .	40.73745
a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess `` on one occasion yang shan ( kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .	113.44244
when that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation , he asked `` where art thou from ' ' ? ?	30.28093
`` early this morning ' ' , replied the other , `` i set out from india ' ' .	29.4527
`` why ' ' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late ' ' ? ?	37.04701
`` i stopped ' ' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries ' ' .	26.761152
`` thou mayst have supernatural powers ' ' , exclaimed yang shan , `` yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me ' ' .	45.695587
then the monk praised yang shan saying `` i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri , and met unexpectedly with minor shakya ' ' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india , went back through the air .	96.04249
in the popular chinese mind , ch ' an ( zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated .	62.41923
a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes .	65.46382
to the zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings ' ' who have to be appeased .	35.025204
part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings ' ' .	54.3473
modern zen presentation to the west insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and so on .	96.08601
this picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as `` o you , demons and other spiritual beings , i now offer this to you , and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith .	100.12539
pope leo 13 , on the 13th day of december 1898 , granted the following indulgences `` an indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the faithful who read the holy gospels at least a quarter of an hour .	55.467575
a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading ' ' .	73.864426
pope pius the sixth , at rome , in april , 1778 , wrote the following `` the faithful should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times ' ' .	79.40031
the american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible .	107.81677
`` we hope ' ' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures ' ' .	41.762005
they recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures ' ' .	71.32761
since the catholic church expresses such desire that the sacred scriptures be read , the following taken from the holy bible ( new catholic edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing .	60.2228
do not wonder that i said to thee , `` you must be born again ' ' .	12.659081
the new birth is necessary because god is holy .	44.592243
but as the one who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior	284.7559
for it is written , you shall be holy , because i am holy .	43.921143
1 , st . peter 15 , 16 .	5.319893
holiness without which no man will see god .	51.36566
the new birth is necessary because all have sinned .	8.806396
as it is written , there is not one just man	1012.98016
all have sinned and have need of the glory of god .	16.20726
the new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .	76.75025
therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death , and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned .	61.05027
you also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .	82.615906
and if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .	37.00101
in their case , the god of this world ( satan ) has blinded their unbelieving minds , that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ , who is the image of god .	29.681019
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	36.77753
the new birth is effected through the word of god	3.2855895
for you have been reborn , not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible , through the word of god .	60.76055
of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .	44.931404
amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water ( symbol of the word of god , see ephesians 26 ) and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	42.02262
that which is born of the flesh is flesh	203.53401
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .	37.609238
if we are born of god we have faith in christ as the only saviour .	24.51579
everyone who believes that jesus is the christ is born of god .	13.620133
as many as received him were born of god .	9.472389
if we are born of god we do not practice sin as a habit .	41.819237
whoever is born of god does not commit sin ( that is , he does not practice sin .	32.738003
cf . 1 st . john 2 1 ) .	5.8639817
we know that no one who is born of god commits sin .	19.464638
( the new nature , received at the time of regeneration , is divine and holy , and as the believer lives under the power of this new nature he does not practice sin .	80.33318
) if we are born of god we practice righteousness .	109.12202
if you know that he ( god ) is just ( righteous ) , know that everyone also who does what is just ( righteous ) has been born of him .	81.370285
if we are born of god we love god .	20.22118
everyone who loves is born of god , and knows god .	102.44987
if we are born of god we love the brethren .	20.623852
we know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren .	36.084328
he who does not love abides in death .	3.7673037
if we are born of god we overcome the world .	9.159692
all that is born of god overcomes the world	18.119612
and this is the victory that overcomes the world , our faith .	80.563385
if we are born of god we grow in ( not into , but in ) grace .	301.15738
but grow in grace and knowledge of our lord and savior , jesus christ .	25.055296
if we are born of god we persevere unto the end .	56.46165
i am convinced of this , that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of christ jesus .	78.50828
now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory , without blemish , in gladness , to the only god our savior , through jesus christ our lord , belong glory and majesty , dominion and authority , before all time , and now , and forever .	82.62729
the new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .	56.054195
jesus answered and said to him ( nicodemus ) `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' .	13.262256
`` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	22.88994
that which is born of the flesh is flesh	203.53401
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .	37.609238
do not wonder that i said to thee , ' you must be born again ' ' ' .	22.103132
for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account .	188.08923
if then any man is in christ , he is a new creature ( literally , `` he is a new creation ) , the former things have passed away	90.09855
for by grace you have been saved through faith	205.23346
and that not from yourselves , for it is the gift of god	19.271387
not as the outcome of works , lest anyone may boast .	410.04752
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	36.77753
the new birth is the implantation of a new life .	41.256268
he who has the son has the life .	32.130257
he who has not the son has not the life .	61.13942
he who believes in the son ( jesus christ , the son of god ) , has everlasting life .	15.254659
the new birth is the impartation of the divine nature .	63.65954
through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises , so that through them you may become partaker of the divine nature .	90.916985
the new birth is christ living in you by faith .	158.33025
christ in you , your hope of glory .	4.5332823
it is now no longer i that live , but christ lives in me .	72.42792
and the life that i now live in the flesh , i live in the faith of the son of god , who loved me and gave himself up for me .	37.64729
to have christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .	44.46759
the wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes .	146.35356
so is everyone who is born of the spirit .	49.672245
amen , amen , i say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has life everlasting , and does not come to judgment , but has passed from death to life .	97.018074
the new birth is a work of god .	7.12185
but to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of god	81.800476
to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .	77.01853
you may be very religious , a good church member , an upright , honest and sincere person	80.60108
you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful	10.319442
you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church	126.09362
you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment .	66.576706
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .	16.567665
our blessed lord jesus christ , the sinless son of god , who could not lie , said , `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' ( st . john 3 3 ) .	17.434
`` you must be born again ' ' ( st . john 3 7 ) .	10.383778
being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting christ as saviour , and being convicted by the holy spirit of my lost condition , i do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works , and just now receive jesus as my personal saviour and salvation as a free gift from him .	77.76738
you may do as you please with god now .	176.34789
god placed himself in men ' s hands when he sent jesus christ into the world as perfect god and perfect man in one being .	133.78717
he was then in man ' s hands .	4.800593
finally men arrested him , gave him a mock trial , flogged him , nailed him on a cross and hung him between earth and heaven	82.897026
you can do likewise though christ is not bodily present .	461.77774
you can ignore his book , the bible , and his church .	26.685415
you can laugh at his blood-bought salvation , curse his followers , and laugh at hell .	97.74571
the eternal christ may knock at your soul ' s door , calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven .	81.6631
you may refuse him , spit on him , call him a devil , curse him .	38.64731
you may take his name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .	121.32436
on the other hand , you may seek his favor , humble yourself before him and beg his mercy , implore his forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to him .	106.06034
he has said , `` behold , i stand at the door , and knock if any man hear my voice , and open the door , i will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me ' ' ( revelation 3 20	87.870735
the latch is on your side of the door .	37.960274
the choice is yours the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with god	156.77646
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of holy spirit discipline .	232.52849
the choice is yours god is in your hands , now .	52.281902
god has already set the day when you will be in his hands .	37.18891
what he does with you then depends on what you do with him now .	57.81987
then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god ' ' if you have abused him in your hands .	61.09716
this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .	60.698032
when i came into being , 15 years ago , i had one primary purpose to help men and women everywhere to know god better , and through knowing him better to become happier and more effective people .	123.35547
when you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts .	78.35875
some of the people who speak through my pages are famous	1057.0117
some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .	293.1854
some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of god , that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see .	43.762115
fifteen years ago , there were no guideposts at all .	20.30757
this month a million guideposts will circulate all over the world .	12.08475
experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .	5.599199
they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following .	250.14406
to me , the explanation is very simple .	7.1025815
i am not doing anything , of myself .	14.25769
it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn away from it .	69.41409
it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass .	90.477974
it is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .	71.813446
it is mankind ' s wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .	24.267706
all things are possible to god , but he chooses -- usually -- to work through people .	211.87927
sometimes such people sense that they are being used	174.00247
fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .	70.782555
neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea .	82.33483
they borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2 , 000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called guideposts .	166.84415
compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed .	448.98047
but from the start they had two important ingredients sincerity and realism .	91.39119
the people who told the stories were sincere .	4.616323
for example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of new york ' s down-and-outers , he didn ' t just ask questions .	86.08697
len lesourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .	19.662674
many of you are familiar , i ' m sure , with the story of my early struggles the fire in january , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers .	100.80364
the help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .	149.11977
the crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .	91.53398
that was when a remarkable woman , teresa durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage .	83.217354
`` you ' re not living up to your own principles ' ' , she told my discouraged people .	49.802258
`` you ' re so preoccupied that you ' ve let your faith grow dim .	57.442997
what do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ? ?	7.235552
visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them ' ' ! !	26.961758
and the 100 , 000 subscribers became a reality .	352.19208
and now a million january guideposts are in circulation .	247.34183
with our growth came expansion into new fields of service .	24.537796
today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .	20.112242
they say all personnel have spiritual needs which guideposts helps to meet .	318.88287
hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land .	194.53279
they say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built .	81.093414
thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the armed forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere .	57.415916
bedridden people say i am easy to hold -- and read .	328.68323
three years ago it became possible to finance a braille edition for blind readers .	103.15703

twice a month the editorial staff meets in new york for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange .	49.462807
around the table sit protestant , catholic , and jew .	42.076427

recently , john sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer .	32.639687
we prayed for john , during surgery , we asked others to pray	195.13844
all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .	124.33416
perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .	165.64012
but , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it .	112.41186
that is the kind of people they are .	64.34149
perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ?	90.69702
serious , yes , but also much laughter .	8.534472
sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate .	163.77336
there are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea .	87.128815
and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .	47.91974
each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group .	27.341942
it takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help guideposts ' readers .	82.39264
for you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is guideposts .	51.82117
i need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers .	36.957485
my message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in god .	88.54754
havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men ' s eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices .	46.962807
rumors flew from lip to lip that fidel castro was on his way to havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought batista for five years .	48.688053
already the city was filled with barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the prado .	33.23785
and then castro himself did come , bearded , smiling	26.22645
yet if you looked closely you ' d see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .	48.115723
at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .	141.07144
i am sure that castro was happy , too , about that support .	111.69502
diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny .	180.03015
my grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .	28.369402
my own earliest memories are of exiles my three brothers and i were taken often to the united states `` to visit relatives ' ' while my father stayed on to fight the dictator machado .	93.02186
when it was my turn , i , too , printed the truth as i knew it about batista , and rejoiced to see his regime topple .	87.901955
none of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead .	60.040382
i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana .	72.0272
within a week , however , i began to suspect that something was wrong .	45.77999
for castro was bringing cuba not freedom , but hatred .	86.05019
he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge .	289.30637
he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras .	226.2313
on home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall .	106.273056
he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .	3.6175888
new schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation any academic degree earned during batista ' s regime was invalid .	246.73611
he had promised cheaper housing arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room .	137.72542
under another law , hundreds of farms were seized .	75.34994
farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .	75.11324
of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in `` people ' s stores ' ' .	80.90359
a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist .	34.709953
in my mind , i began to review his use of hate to gain support	123.4807
his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain .	105.431656
but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace	67.31063
what should i do about it , i asked myself ? ?	54.344593
i had watched castro handling his enemies before the paredon .	33.032284
there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting `` paredon ! !	127.52694
i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario now the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors	184.48126
the thump and whir of our new presses .	5.586506
here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if i told it to .	89.67209
then one day , early in january , 1960 , i sat down at my desk , and suddenly i was aware of the crucifix .	48.119934
it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .	29.678928
i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner .	69.82737
now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness in his eyes , saying	72.03194
but do you have any choice ' ' ? ?	2.775337
i knew in that moment that i did not have any choice .	33.014107
from that day on i began to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in fidel castro ' s regime .	67.73014
too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don ' t want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things ' ' because `` you ' ll stunt your growth ' ' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` hey lookit mr . america	65.53972
whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) ' ' ? ?	55.19371
after all , a guy ' s gotta have a little ego ! !	21.907377
therefore it ' s a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! !	155.26201
this happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new junior mr . canada -- henri de courcy .	233.50526
far from discouraging henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .	151.7754
instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority , professor roland claude .	208.97928
and they couldn ' t have entrusted henri to better hands because `` le professeur ' ' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth .	133.3383
that ' s because the good professor teaches only weider methods at his famous montreal health studio which is located at 1821 mt . royal east in montreal .	122.25417
undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) .	116.89641
there ' s gaetan d ' amours who is our newest mr . canada	243.8127
jean-paul senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago	260.43048
jack boissoneault , who was with us last month	12.492504
charles harve , who recently won the `` most muscular man ' ' subdivision award in the mr . canada event	113.65891
yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! !	1.4666862
now when henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 ' ' ' ' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .	59.30791
about that time he began reading mr . america and muscle builder and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining .	313.8988
seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of quick-wate and super-protein , those two wonder-working weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .	49.95589
well , sir they did real great ! !	1.2803837
for in almost less time than it takes to tell it , henri ' s bodyweight was increasing rapidly .	47.95514
he ' s crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame .	117.917946
henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn ' t have to work them very much .	58.587025
but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .	10.527299
it was muscular but it wasn ' t symmetrical .	27.734896
`` a real ' nothing ' torso ' ' , says henri .	16.849976
it just got longer and longer ' ' .	2.3704545
that ' s when he went to professor claude .	206.0106
and at once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .	58.665882
in his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out ' ' equipment since vic tanny .	61.965034
mr . claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous weider push-pull super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set is a pressing or `` pushing ' ' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling ' ' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .	80.17957
so right away claude introduced henri to his famous `` moon ' ' bench and proceeded to teach him his first push-pull super-set consisting of the wide-grip straight-arm pullover ( the `` pull ' ' part of the push-pull super-set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar bench press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , reeves-type `` gladiator ' ' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .	60.836304
as you can see , in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! !	154.35434
now when henri has completed four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete push-pull super-sets no . 2 .	89.69467
super-set no . 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon ' ' and flat benches .	93.849304
the `` push ' ' exercise of this push-pull super-set is the bench press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .	171.5934
you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .	36.871002
the dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the aj .	21.35681
the `` pull ' ' exercise in this super-set is the one-dumbbell bent-arm pullover .	60.94972
( note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) .	106.05149
in the third push-pull super-set the `` push ' ' exercise is the widegrip pushup between bars , while the `` pull ' ' exercise is the moon bench lateral raise with bent arms .	56.898655
the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! !	66.37238
this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .	72.2899
you ' ll know when you ' ve made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ! !	107.08768
as you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip .	76.66616
he just can ' t do anything about it at all ! !	38.676933
but as you can also see , it ' s not a painful exercise at all , because henri de courcy -- the `` happy ' ' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! !	55.8424
the last exercise of roland claude ' s prescribed program for henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets .	306.71902
by this time henri ' s entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work .	129.81772
he has henri do from four to six sets of the incline bench press ( note the high incline ) .	34.563667
this gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and aj .	95.00834
this is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests	858.7418
that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock ' ' looks of the great champions .	34.27879
so with four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , four of no . 2 , four of no . 3 and four to six sets of the incline bench press , you can see that henri de courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon .	43.28254
physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .	130.26994
rarer still is a mr . america or mr . universe of true herculean build .	143.67511
the aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles .	192.30026
now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts .	41.32273
but contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor ' s chisel -- is something quite different .	85.29163
this comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .	111.18702
often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .	55.264946
because they are `` minority ' ' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten .	175.09406
only when the newest mr . america or mr . universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are .	153.3718
the exercise i shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the one leg lunge .	61.26672
why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! !	191.63084
it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders	120.97342
a criterion of muscle `` drama ' ' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike	232.71196
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .	7.432402
definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which is easily understandable .	140.94322
the one leg lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .	396.17172
but for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular squatting , leg curling , leg extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed .	39.38462
indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .	137.28226
used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ! !	83.63197
really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective 1 .	117.98493
it ' s a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise .	7.5892096
it places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .	239.9944
it improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make squats more easily and more correctly performed .	95.24244
it speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each .	189.5085
you ' ll need your weider power stands for this fine exercise and here ' s the way it ' s done 1 .	56.155052
place your power stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean .	88.01238
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck )	64.12051
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .	53.602757
now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet .	77.67147
when the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the power stands .	120.75211
after you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .	40.563755
that ' s the one-leg lunge in a nutshell .	12.504835
you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety .	222.40742
you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise .	116.227104
oh , you ' ll wobble and weave quite a bit at first .	94.388435
before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you ' ll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ! !	73.98858
although i suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there ' s no reason why you shouldn ' t make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .	35.85417
squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front .	177.43192
the most beautiful bed of pansies i ' ve seen was in a south dakota yard on a sizzling day .	54.704212
pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .	112.24346
i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .	61.341785
`` i just love them ' ' , he said .	5.499643
the more i talked with him , the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming .	67.6202
of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .	44.633015
he planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist .	22.334099
these specialists , i learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers .	61.28124
their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .	22.135822
i asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .	38.469856
occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did	85.772446
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down ' ' .	101.58364
it ' s best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .	68.03376
his soil was `` nothing special ' ' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown-black .	48.877995
i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .	92.01606
it isn ' t easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .	108.36214
nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .	63.61763
they germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily .	45.279804
it doesn ' t really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours .	112.27375
i like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames .	144.66351
they ' d rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .	106.13845
if you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .	46.26579
for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .	44.198624
i dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .	79.615074
then i cover the sowing with a board .	40.17645
this keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .	52.31159
ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .	60.806316
when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board .	54.100002
a light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth .	115.39435
i like sawdust for this , or hay .	35.099228
when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it ' s time to set them out where they are to remain .	68.32069
every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .	165.59859
the moral is don ' t transplant it any oftener than you must .	190.72253
as soon as they are large enough to move , i put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom .	152.52594
i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .	188.93213
that encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .	136.93188
i doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .	12.218365
lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine .	195.98404
one year i simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and i had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience .	74.74844
in addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .	145.82275
as a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .	53.75222
three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .	39.360523
when winter comes be ready with additional mulch .	9.152922
i like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost .	97.76511
that keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .	16.943497
don ' t miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .	30.584581
whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you ' ll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .	29.575327
if those aren ' t enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ?	213.86725
the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february during a particularly cold winter .	142.28171
i started the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .	88.6839
( an unheated greenhouse would have been better , if i had had one .	75.806114
) the plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them .	59.829327
in response to the lengthening days of february they budded , then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers .	53.09469
its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it .	158.97122
like strawberries in december , pansies are far more exciting in february than in may .	95.29027
try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can ' t take another day of it .	72.693474
the day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy ' ' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .	48.16515
try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there .	88.24793
pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season .	65.6898
as soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant .	216.3247
a second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch .	126.04577
these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .	175.12169
i like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming .	91.36422
probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed .	102.30405
nature ' s aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation .	56.267685
that done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .	108.76986
here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .	133.83273
go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .	9.654334
it is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things	74.69197
but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .	110.04985
many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .	70.267426
if the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first .	43.21531
would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ?	1.0600125
remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds .	123.842636
they stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it .	131.01276
treat them right and they ' ll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .	157.79752
give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they ' ll repay your solicitude with beauty .	52.49456
a salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .	167.68144
this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the united states .	53.782978
it has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven ' t made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should .	74.796646
you will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .	37.727882
it is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe bartlett pear , but oily .	37.083668
the avocado should have a `` give ' ' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .	28.373764
the flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange	182.46507
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like .	18.505949
it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .	78.29544
sometimes it takes several `` eatings ' ' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world .	166.03494
once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation .	130.15105
today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world .	97.085365
the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point .	38.056496
it is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior .	50.72912
the fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-f . , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state .	106.62344
this cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .	108.71691
this happens on the grocer ' s shelf or in your kitchen .	67.64948
one of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .	50.89585
there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .	288.45605
if the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed .	167.16197
and unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado .	23.540115
it is thick , much like an egg plant ' s skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .	59.84425
good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .	52.80072
avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients .	130.31998
their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system .	26.497648
aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins a and c -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin e requirement .	74.694466
the b vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .	22.117344
calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts .	87.89729
none of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .	84.88408
dr . wilson c . grant , of the veterans ' administration hospital , coral gables , florida , and the university of miami school of medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .	40.99318
the study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .	88.51875
they were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood .	63.758907
then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .	51.36483
five , four , three , two , one , fire ! !	98.93663
the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .	76.60571
the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach .	54.019566
never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear .	114.16281
nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying .	39.135452
a great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets .	250.41066
it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent ' s cities and people .	100.79153
with a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim ' s people ? ?	67.23194
wouldn ' t the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?	112.750374
the will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken .	94.14266
nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days	475.58813
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .	71.66378
at this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being `` soft ' ' , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons .	66.22566
however , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent ' s cities , at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal .	63.845524
it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic .	24.294687
icbms have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways .	32.595966
they could be used to attack a nation ' s people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker ' s own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy ' s military force .	34.57402
if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles .	78.768166
we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .	108.20815
we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile .	59.001575
missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations .	321.5165
because of a missile ' s ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately .	48.23112
placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons .	93.421165
one must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .	80.55793
even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously , the icbm still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes .	62.311787
therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered .	60.52361
because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability .	102.214714
in order to destroy the enemy ' s mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles .	45.403835
until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .	60.869034
it seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other ' s citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us .	66.61097
let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm force .	46.0009
it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the b-52 or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based missiles .	36.007057
if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons .	46.064327
an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of russia -- provided that we had used some of our icbms to degrade russia ' s air defenses before our bombers got there .	118.368965
the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .	80.314186
why , then , aren ' t we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ?	92.57105
is there any other way to do the job ? ?	24.06239
survivability of our strategic forces ( polaris , mobile and hardened minuteman , hardened atlas and titan , and airborne skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force .	55.933006
war , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation .	175.23128
forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict .	122.39953
the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed .	24.021421
even mobile forces must be found and destroyed .	2.2046573
but , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ?	108.026375
they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile .	10.182743
some day , many years in the future , true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets .	51.240955
but until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft .	78.10322
however , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft ' ' airfields .	109.92288
here then is our problem aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing	130.28456
but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile .	81.46094
this makes today ' s aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon .	147.89117
aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .	131.77022
this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .	68.302414
but remember this -- it isn ' t the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield .	86.304276
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles .	80.050026
there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground	28.465937
put aircraft in `` bomb-proof ' ' hangars when they are on the ground .	23.41257
build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3 , 000-foot ) airfields with runways .	55.097626
if we could use all the small airfields we have in this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more .	56.285206
use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .	55.29281
using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( vtol ) long-range military aircraft .	13.1851635
we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 aj .	88.910675
we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .	53.027763
large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3 , 000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today .	59.003746
there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile .	80.433685
this same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft .	60.109337
one seldom hears the analogy `` nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine ' ' .	51.861935
if , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one .	48.053143
with powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built .	70.10017
for example , a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter .	13.168303
with a 15-to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300 , 000 pounds could rise vertically .	66.18819
the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don ' t spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete .	67.525764
when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to aj .	40.733612
if our sac bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance .	144.90736
we would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy ' s force -- whether it were fixed or mobile .	48.035583
with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating .	72.688446
no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy ' s military force .	38.579292
our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance .	65.18929
in a few years we will have samos ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .	46.4769
but in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ? ?	85.6645
what targets have we successfully knocked out ? ?	1.0741538
a ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful .	97.95231
what targets still remain to be hit ? ?	1.0164825
these crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .	121.98288
samos will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark .	51.099155
even if this is some day possible , there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target .	88.85507
if the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced .	53.333534
pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably .	25.147293
it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .	93.87598
it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .	42.564594
it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the united states with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone .	107.71852
a large aircraft , such as the b-52 or b-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons .	87.96098
few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1 , 000 psi overpressure at 100 feet .	46.894814
or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in hiroshima and nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! !	62.471546
it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons .	102.98825
today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc . .	114.4213
with these keen `` eyes ' ' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas .	170.96315
if we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy ' s military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening .	73.91252
the lyric beauties of schubert ' s trout quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners .	77.759224
but for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems .	40.402786
since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic .	90.831276
moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .	61.86418
the many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .	73.62349
some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .	68.70311
other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .	81.14587
in these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown ' s attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .	62.382484
recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer than ten different performances .	146.25407
the occasion for this marathon angel ' s long-awaited reissue in its `` great recordings of the century ' ' series of the schnabel-pro arte version .	41.673275
let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first .	102.69554
whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , colh 40 is a document of prime importance .	141.8339
artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .	117.848076
but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to are by schnabel pupils ( clifford curzon , frank glazer , adrian aeschbacher , and victor babin ) also sheds light on the master ' s pedagogical skills .	49.24073
certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` schnabel trill ' ' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .	82.33479
but the most impressive testimony to schnabel ' s distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student ' s approach as distinctly his own .	128.92976
schnabel ' s emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .	68.895195
yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .	65.884575
this is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .	17.75416
and although schnabel ' s pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to schubert ' s dynamic markings and phrase indications .	61.745884
the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .	192.95517
about the pro arte ' s contribution i am less happy .	133.35045
i , for one , rather regret that schnabel didn ' t collaborate with the budapest quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist ' s interpretative outlook than the style of the belgian group .	63.291336
from a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the pro arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .	40.86851
the violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .	47.95539
the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .	96.6004
there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` forellen ' ' movement , and i suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original aj .	37.608986
turning to the more modern versions , curzon ' s ( london ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .	41.517944
every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these i would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .	106.38475
some of curzon ' s playing strikes me as finicky , however .	71.14269
why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? ?	82.78263
the assisting musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .	110.984566
( special compliments to the double bass playing of johann krumpp his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance .	26.59213
the glazer-fine arts edition ( concert-disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .	27.698156
it is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .	80.248955
but having lived with the disc for some time now , i find the performance less exciting than either schnabel ' s or fleisher ' s ( whose superb performance with the budapest quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon ' s .	82.46548
aeschbacher ' s work is very much akin to schnabel ' s , but the sound on his decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it .	55.996895
the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet ( angel ) and victor babin-festival quartet ( rca victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .	42.040947
( babin has acquired some of schnabel ' s keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight .	103.611206
) badura-skoda-vienna konzerthaus ( westminster ) and demus-schubert quartet ( deutsche grammophon ) are both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .	23.98979
helmut roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists .	96.98648
telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2 . 98 ) is worthy of consideration .	106.39242
returning once again to the schnabel reissue , i am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist ' s musical penetration .	33.070374
here is truly a `` great recording of the century ' ' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .	22.767918
this recording surely belongs in everyone ' s collection .	190.58472
from the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation .	94.25576
seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones .	67.95964
although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .	88.20211
on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of parsifal under karl muck ' s baton , or sense the type of ensemble toscanini created in his years with the new york philharmonic .	54.143658
since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .	116.053986
in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer .	86.772415
other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .	138.53815
if we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing .	152.33398
records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .	91.238235
this difference is made up of many factors .	7.297425
some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .	106.60854
( music often sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat .	113.56736
) from the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original .	73.03591
any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .	121.77343
yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .	207.38423
but if you know the real thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation .	103.758934
command ' s new brahms second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .	66.65488
like the recent scheherazade from london ( high fidelity , sept . 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .	73.82446
because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph .	57.90513
the easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .	75.7634
the engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .	101.58568
the effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .	110.53938
this absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .	139.66167
a contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .	187.36774
the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .	31.141903
yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .	142.14542
command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .	5.6171274
the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority	126.928215
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .	11.185728
the timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .	30.244068
all of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction .	98.891396
for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .	54.333893
steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what brahms set down on paper .	157.5528
those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .	76.77357
without losing the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect .	118.210915
the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real allegro con spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .	49.020267
in the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .	134.88232
steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .	95.548706
the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .	31.575602
too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .	75.31857
the command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .	22.10486
your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .	141.884
it is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .	175.10382
the first substantially complete stereo giselle ( and the only one of its scope since feyer ' s four-sided lp edition of 1958 for angel ) , this set is , i ' m afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .	67.00302
the already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari ' s melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .	84.66228
and in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super-high fidelity ' ' .	48.943226
the home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .	88.058815
as with the penultimate giselle release ( wolff ' s abridgment for rca victor ) i find the cleaner , less razor-edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my sd copies .	51.350945
at the westminster kc dog show in madison square garden , new york on the second day , the finals of the junior class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class .	42.085403
the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far south as kentucky .	96.0603
this year several entries from canada were entered which made the junior class international .	279.84286
forty-six of the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present .	98.13398
it was interesting to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class .	57.033848
as has been the custom for the past several years , john cross , jr . , bench show chmn . of westminster , arranged for the juniors ' meeting before the class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them .	104.57327
over 60 juniors , parents and guests attended .	22.208313
mrs . william h . long , jr . speaks	130.47852
after the juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the finals of the junior class , mrs . william h . long , jr . was introduced as the first speaker .	17.686638
in her opening remarks mrs . long also welcomed the juniors and stated , `` there isn ' t any other show quite like westminster .	66.71975
i know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break .	318.94644
mrs . long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years .	154.96991
twenty years ago her daughter betsey long , then 13 years of age , won the grand challenge trophy , children ' s handling class ( as they were called then ) at westminster .	135.36401
no sooner had betsey come out of the ring than mrs . long walked into the working competition with ch . cadet or noranda , another home-bred product , and won ! !	177.25746
speaking from long years of experience , mrs . long advised the juniors `` when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ! !	103.480705
dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ! !	14.97358
when you and your dog step into the junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do .	63.47773
if you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! !	59.31441
he knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers ' ' .	78.08062
`` take away your attitude ' ' , said mrs . long , `` and what have you left ? ?	39.508263
either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ! !	174.71873
or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the class , or you are just doing this to please the parents .	81.463455
`` the reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce .	150.3656
aids sounds more like a pony club , or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ! !	175.54472
`` your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be	102.89445
legs to produce motion and rate of speed .	7.4574723
without right attitude the other aids just do not work right ' ' .	39.85932
mrs . long wished all the juniors luck in the class and stated , `` have fun ! !	66.64566
and may you all continue to show at westminster in the years to come ' ' ! !	34.440178
the second speaker was harvey barcus , president of the dog writers ass ' n of america .	116.90628
mr . barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for juniors -- with which he is very familiar .	102.33542
last year a boy he knows and helped in journalism won the thoroughbred racing ass ' n scholarship which is worth $10 , 000 .	128.33699
he gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship .	113.2765
`` junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged ' ' ! !	80.25011
is one of mr . barcus ' strong beliefs .	79.23438
he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should take a more active part in encouraging the junior division ! !	120.08151
in closing , mr . barcus also wished all the juniors luck in their class .	25.767563
instead of 3 a . m . in the past , the juniors class at westminster was held at 4 45 p . m . .	23.71797
this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! !	118.43779
before the juniors entered the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs .	72.67351
from there on , each junior was going to be judged individually .	31.66823
this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the class .	100.55558
this year anne hone rogers , outstanding handler , judged the class .	83.81118
this is the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at westminster that a lady handler has judged the class .	99.2324
as the juniors entered the ring , mr . spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that westminster has held the finals of the junior competition .	90.46667
juniors competed last year at american kennel club and canadian kennel club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this class -- the finals for the year .	36.06095
a junior who won two or more wins in the open class was eligible .	119.20005
( the purpose of the junior showmanship competition is to teach and encourage juniors to become good sportsmen .	50.195038
many adults showing at westminster today are products of this class .	72.96556
it seemed an almost impossible job for miss rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 juniors entered .	89.44766
a large number of these juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners .	34.45653
after the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring .	60.297367
she then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship .	288.20938
betty lou ham , age 16 , holyoke , mass . , showing an irish setter , was chosen as international champion of the year .	30.47392
she was awarded the professional handlers ' ass ' ns ' leonard brumby , sr . memorial trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the junior classes .	29.30163
betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year .	108.04672
in addition to showing an irish setter throughout the year , she also scored with an afghan .	49.8658
sydney le blanc , age 15 , staten island , n . y . , showing a doberman pinscher , was 2nd .	10.90971
susan hackmann , age 14 , from baltimore , md . , showing a dachshund , was 3rd .	15.129452
last year susan also placed 3rd in the finals at westminster .	26.532581
from the records we keep -- susan is the only junior who has placed in the junior classes in both united states and canada .	34.712914
karen marcmann , age 16 , trapp , penna . , showing a keeshond was 4th .	71.23774
most juniors who were entered in the finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in junior classes but score in the breed classes as well .	139.49008
in 1960 , there were 7287 entries in the junior classes .	11.944813
each year these shows have increased in entries .	18.056768
next year 1962 , at westminster , the bench show committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more junior classes in the open division only to qualify for westminster .	176.68472
percy roberts , a leading judge will not be at the international show this year for the junior judging contest as he has been invited to judge in australia in march .	57.568256
it has been suggested many times that a class be set up for the juniors who are overage and cannot enter the junior classes .	67.39137
for some time this writer has been suggesting a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the junior class .	75.46493
such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester kc show recently .	193.56438
not only were the contestants pleased with the class , but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day .	61.14557
the intermediates in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the judge .	76.12509
we suggested this class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows .	149.37625
at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated that this intermediate judging class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world .	60.339645
this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .	58.477924
last year robert harris , a leading junior handler entered the dog judging contest ( junior ) at the international kc of chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any junior since the class ' inception .	102.179924
juniors who attend this chicago show should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help to them .	61.98004
superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed handler to judge junior showmanship competition .	53.659054
the founder of the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby , sr . ( for whom the trophy is named after at westminster ) was an outstanding handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division .	91.78954
some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a junior ' s ability to show a dog .	52.943066
to overcome this unfair judging , the a . k . c . requires that a licensed handler be present to judge the class .	48.384304
if the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from handlers , it has been suggested that licensed judges also be qualified to judge this class .	61.123795
by recognizing and helping juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners .	103.80229
the airedale terrier club of america and the kerry blue terrier club of america have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in junior showmanship competition at any show .	66.872986
the kansas city and the topeka kcs are arranging that juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for westminster .	136.43051
the rio grande kc is also considering having their junior classes set up so that juniors can qualify with points for westminster .	150.47986
the american pointer club is still continuing to donate trophies to juniors who win at junior showmanship classes with pointers .	51.15244
traveling through the south -- over 16 , 000 miles -- with two great danes , an afghan , and a persian kitten , we ' ve worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels .	79.442
my husband enters the motel office , signs up for a room , and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets .	48.002544
`` no ' ' , he replies , `` full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained ' ' .	44.54039
once settled , we ' re careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can ' t do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture .	83.78685
in the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ! !	109.88268
many a motel owner -- when we ' ve stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children .	153.35922
so many times i have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination .	132.93999
is it that they don ' t care ? ?	6.9617248
are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient ? ?	76.43867
at one time , to most americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the united states navy .	80.55962
today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport .	100.78378
there are more than 8 , 000 , 000 recreational boats in use in the united states with almost 10 , 000 , 000 the prediction for within the next decade .	54.538734
about 40 , 000 , 000 people participated in boating in 1960 .	43.489773
boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .	28.882267
boats are operated in every state in the union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the middle west .	65.96942
the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation ' s coastline .	51.63387
but during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock .	80.44976
developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country .	91.68036
no matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile lake texoma , located between texas and oklahoma , which resulted when the corp of army engineers dammed the red river .	70.14533
in 1959 , according to the engineers , lake texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1 , 000 , 000 persons .	64.93304
where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water .	65.05281
providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1 , 800 , 000 boat trailers now in use .	68.36899
it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2 , 000 .	80.98695
the sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace .	165.44807
boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year- ' round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat .	89.91747
today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door .	46.167435
arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun .	201.11087
and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .	38.14315
this year , americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation ' s national , regional and local boat shows .	74.69735
the boats of america ' s trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons .	69.66786
the variety of craft on the country ' s waters today is overwhelming .	74.487076
they range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100 , 000 .	46.321087
boat prices vary according to the buyer ' s desires or needs .	105.98067
in this respect , boats can be compared with houses .	112.69523
there is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget .	143.82735
there is no question as to just what is available .	33.540718
you name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models .	81.64496
there are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips .	21.842957
there are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience .	122.00812
you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond .	112.013176
you may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal .	37.855053
you may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks .	50.581066
you may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .	79.562546
designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat .	96.26904
you pay your money and you take your choice .	29.020655
american technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in american boating .	117.98065
i wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , americans excel over any country in the world in the long run .	76.92259
russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance .	53.730736
the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .	84.91643
these engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .	374.0457
their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook , the range being about $150 to $1 , 000 , depending on size .	68.06995
great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country	117.2182
and to making the owning of a boat simpler .	263.55478
there was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel .	33.807514
having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended .	116.53944
marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later .	326.9511
terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles .	201.59535
of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser ' s earning power , credit rating and local bank policy .	42.040356
outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats .	25.45107
terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .	80.72501
when the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go .	184.82703
when air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all .	100.541145
man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft .	167.83902
it was much the same with pleasure boating at first .	61.04675
come one , come all , the water ' s fine ! !	20.15101
as the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do	139.49327
however , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating .	53.82023
laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower .	44.3143
what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .	47.97728
the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used .	68.35937
if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the u . s . coast guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on federal waterways .	55.6261
state numbering laws differ from each other in many ways .	38.225613
fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such as sailboats with no power , to be registered at all .	68.47329
many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators .	132.59578
generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities .	82.73745
it is always wise to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are .	174.16493
ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land	142.67365
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .	85.70875
hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry ' s self originated and directed safety program .	93.18448
foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 .	65.6628
a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers .	67.5435
the industry has been its own watch dog .	13.969334
with u . s . coast guard cooperation , the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety .	102.597404
in 1959 , the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment .	52.69188
a new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at atlantic city , new jersey , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe .	82.7453
in addition to these activities , the naebm , with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue , new york city , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat .	67.12837
it is important to note the work of the united states power squadrons and the u . s . coast guard auxiliary .	21.086979
each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .	99.10019
this year , over 100 , 000 persons will receive this free instruction .	160.65764
as america on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .	61.528214
instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas .	17.295685
the word marina was coined by naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort .	117.52276
currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general store , and a grocery store .	71.38685
yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services .	69.81648
it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards .	307.1152
regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas .	42.823826
boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .	152.73636
a recent survey disclosed there are about 4 , 000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the united states , the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats .	19.289223
the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .	75.25184
in the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves .	89.68774
the main set of bars are the `` tappets ' ' and one tappet is connected to each lever .	32.344353
if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .	49.166157
close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .	7.585687
these can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .	46.819893
the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .	176.51303
in the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called `` dogs ' ' .	46.379997
two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .	34.631626
these slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them .	36.885242
here ' s how the scheme works suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .	28.543821
this also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars .	134.27988
the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets .	98.91946
by this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal .	232.77654
interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red ' ' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear ' ' the signal .	49.883816
this is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant ' ' .	81.56919
a turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points .	101.780106
a signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked .	148.02727
such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face ' ' oncoming traffic .	68.9749
the lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point .	78.69087
if the points aren ' t thrown all the way , the turnout cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be cleared .	43.596554
generally , these locks on turnouts are called `` facing point locks ' ' .	31.760574
figs . 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals .	34.969017
each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart ' ' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled .	104.38705
the lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars .	19.411568
by studying the track-signal diagrams you ' ll note several other details .	175.80508
derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a `` stop ' ' signal -- are used in many instances .	57.786907
`` home ' ' signals have two blades .	8.462445
the blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move .	71.59247
as an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant ' ' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant .	52.977573
in some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution .	37.50559
in other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects .	285.0155
the interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on paul larson ' s railroad follows the fig . 1 scheme and is shown beginning in fig . 7 , page 65 , and in the photos .	82.82251
here ' s how it can be built .	4.5296493
the sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig . 7 , most of the bars being 1/8 ' ' ' ' brass in 1/4 ' ' ' ' and 1/2 ' ' ' ' widths .	23.65409
you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish .	126.95255
our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction .	46.588272
when cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk .	88.22584
start with the right-hand piece `` b ' ' , af , soldering it to the lower piece `` a ' ' of the same material but 12 ' ' ' ' long .	30.360125
let exactly 1 ' ' ' ' of `` a ' ' extend beyond `` b ' ' and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees .	55.819504
now lay 12 pieces of af cut 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . .	32.279198
this gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece `` b ' ' .	23.431799
compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` b ' ' .	33.788746
solder this second `` b ' ' to `` a ' ' at right angles .	21.998669
there should be 10 ' ' ' ' between the two parallel members and each should be 1 ' ' ' ' from an end of the long piece .	54.368362
cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a af bar .	13.821462
tack-solder all the 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . pieces to the 10 ' ' ' ' and 12 ' ' ' ' members .	25.308893
these will be drilled and tapped later on .	560.09576
now cut five af locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) .	28.031149
position these using six intermediate temporary af spacers and locate the upper 12 ' ' ' ' bar `` a ' ' .	24.264957
solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame .	12.546707
now place 12 pieces 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long `` tappets ' ' , as they are called .	44.639038
cap with a af bar and tack-solder in place .	20.639801
cap the locking bar spacers with two af directly under the first two `` b ' ' pieces .	29.343916
mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together .	138.46161
placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8 ' ' ' ' from any edge .	48.990707
drill all no . 50 and counter-drill all except the `` a ' ' pieces size 43 .	95.31894
tap the `` a ' ' pieces 2-56 .	6.594331
now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12 ' ' ' ' and the first two 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' bars ( `` a ' ' and `` b ' ' pieces ) , which are soldered together .	28.699932
either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions .	147.05786
dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs .	52.70703
drill 20 no . 47 holes in the upper piece `` a ' ' as shown in fig . 7 .	26.948223
tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on .	372.58936
note , 6 and 8 lock levers don ' t require holes for contacts .	35.512325
now reassemble the frame , using af roundhead steel screws and nuts .	60.90916
put the 12 tappets and some af locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws .	28.317955
be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . spacer .	12.634309
as an anchor for the spring lock , insert a af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in fig . 7 .	20.443932
drill a no . 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw .	81.54146
drill two no . 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 .	48.531075
number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots .	49.380325
remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth .	42.013924
cut five pieces of af brass bar stock 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	4.6335306
these are supporting members for the short locking bars .	2.6642728
locate their positions in fig . 7 and drill no . 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame .	46.05812
cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut .	61.85309
drill four no . 19 and four no . 28 holes in the 12 ' ' ' ' long `` a ' ' pieces .	19.831892
draw-file no . 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends .	153.01408
break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer .	28.040178
drill a no . 50 hole 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' from one end and tap 2-56 .	12.934914
) put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar .	24.185581
to find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge .	30.905544
scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1/4 ' ' ' ' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64 ' ' ' ' ) away from the frame edge .	26.13204
total distance is about 21/64 ' ' ' ' .	2.1481137
tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4 ' ' ' ' tappet movement .	54.95612
drill a no . 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end .	44.17642
drill a no . 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in figs . 7 and 8 .	30.105556
repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars .	6.723036
to each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs . 6 and 8 .	38.483295
these will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts .	70.88462
fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times .	86.71972
as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible .	226.90695
a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished .	99.76625
each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting .	23.288202
the order of fitting is not too important .	4.76517
however , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back .	119.35162
since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar .	99.15568
figs . 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions .	25.66511
all the bars are cut from af brass .	6.9115763
the lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of fig . 7 .	7.6437044
bar `` c ' ' is 2-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	3.9161544
draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame .	38.819
fig . 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes .	14.071543
center-punch and drill the no . 31 hole 7/16 ' ' ' ' from one end of the bar .	7.961965
chuck a length of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8 ' ' ' ' long .	45.449673
cut the piece about 9/32 ' ' ' ' or 5/16 ' ' ' ' long and drive it into the no . 31 hole drilled in the locking bar .	33.373478
file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8 ' ' ' ' above the bar .	12.927076
this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 .	195.49683
place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 .	128.96887
scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` a ' ' .	94.36269
see the drawings for the shape of the notch .	74.86612
scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool .	156.24257
we used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about	69.287476
' ' thick and 1 ' ' ' ' dia . fitted on a 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . mandrel .	14.481543
such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts .	131.38925
a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one .	129.4493
endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible .	12.067046
the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it .	86.45156
assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces .	73.72603
all matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis .	169.02069
chuck a 2 ' ' ' ' or 3 ' ' ' ' piece of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool .	17.417286
fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64 ' ' ' ' long on one end , using swiss pattern files .	86.57606
this tool can also be made with a lathe .	22.612629
scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics .	120.86036
without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go ' round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn .	103.508446
math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .	80.57691
it ' s not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science .	119.12897
but because science is based on mathematics doesn ' t mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician .	19.902866
a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems	124.02648
however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding .	110.47277
a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .	108.67462
it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .	50.89766
the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula .	25.394941
this changes the formula to an `` equation ' ' .	1.9207246
the equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .	12.290988
they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes .	41.43477
however , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order .	54.17179
they indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .	15.307064
the symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .	142.13599
the lower number is always divided into the upper number af	451.40082
the symbol for multiplication is `` **b ' ' .	2.8653057
it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row .	37.79766
numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .	33.077293
the result will be the same regardless of the order used .	89.76252
the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .	151.01697
the number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol .	53.62532
when more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct .	49.93698
for example , for the problem af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 .	123.318115
the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers .	11.8329735
numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .	33.138695
when solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value .	105.39591
multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right .	56.654617
completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps af .	58.196327
this would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 .	126.60145
this part of the equation would then become 4 .	180.18842
for use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents .	17.273134
the easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .	252.90111
charts for this purpose are available from many sources .	28.721157
they are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments .	60.103775
the various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .	110.23577
shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result .	37.39899
a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation .	32.132767
it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .	46.736202
rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .	118.331604
the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .	104.373215
when it is needed , one formula is as important as another .	35.22401
however , some formulas are used more than others .	31.217518
we ' ll take them in the general order of their popularity .	98.63084
a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine .	27.776123
displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume ' ' .	6.7975636
most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions .	118.44072
it is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed .	111.75672
factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine ' s cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant .	22.923216
the constant is , which is one-quarter of 3 . 1416 , another constant known as `` pi ' ' .	39.575558
pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles .	136.00345
actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine .	25.39696
the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders .	23.210066
multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine ' s total displacement .	19.26459
dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .	29.145042
dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) .	14.037364
one inch equals 2 . 54 centimeters one cubic inch equals 16 . 38 cubic centimeters .	23.24269
for example , let ' s consider a standard 283 cubic inch chevy aj .	39.382694
these engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches .	15.766634
the formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes af .	131.85211
to arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right .	82.00254
a cylinder ' s compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder ' s volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber .	19.045576
cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .	28.38252
cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula af .	93.163246
to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level .	49.316498
then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface .	30.475431
this is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .	65.89294
such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber .	34.213413
the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity .	108.04193
most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches .	30.950481
however , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .	7.7576323
the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used .	44.036133
the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .	56.031723
the volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket ' s thickness in thousandths of an inch .	48.646965
sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won ' t affect the final computation .	66.89253
the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume .	10.896146
another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position .	40.33328
compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth .	41.547184
this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening .	18.292608
the total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume ' ' .	13.7160015
after the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula af	34.74818
for an example let ' s dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches .	34.514217
applying these figures to the formula we get the equation af .	18.082169
this method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads .	173.48947
any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed .	31.871384
the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position .	50.850758
there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size .	28.066416
by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three .	41.17837
to simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors .	55.852413
tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .	74.14465
this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft .	20.559813
a tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made .	112.637634
any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics .	81.04108
when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula .	38.531918
to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is af .	13.968021
for an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4 . 00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this af	40.867798
to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is af .	24.895763
using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes af	26.49056
to determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is af .	25.275047
using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes af .	20.310839
-- the best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at ben white raceway has been that of mary liner ( mainliner-highland ellen ) , a member of the dick williams stable , who was clocked 2 25 .	69.17408
she is owned by ralph h . kroening , milwaukee , wis . , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her .	46.362186
other good miles have been by debonnie ( dale frost-debby hanover ) and prompt time ( adios-on time ) in 2 28- 36	23.530289
kimberly gal ( galophone-kimberly hanover ) 2 26 . 2	7.126072
laguerre hanover ( tar heel-lotus hanover ) and monel ( tar heel-miracle byrd ) in 2 34 .	9.030582
laguerre hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait .	95.16535
this colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them .	99.62843
monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races .	94.87144
stardel ( star ' s pride-starlette hanover ) , 2 34 , looks quite promising .	24.86683
fury hanover ( hoot mon-fay ) , caper ( hoot mon-columbia hanover ) and isaac ( hoot mon-goddess hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago .	42.306328
fury and caper worked in 2 35 and did it with ease .	266.52838
they are two good colts of different type .	6.423527
fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and caper is more the compact type .	121.780685
i have never seen caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so .	75.28422
fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground .	106.23744
trackdown ( torrid-mighty lady ) has worked a mile in 2 33 . 3 .	21.05057
it took this colt several weeks to strike a pace .	105.43854
then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks .	18.95156
he has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse .	96.07914
thor hanover ( adios-trustful hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet .	147.6806
this colt arrived at the raceway early last november , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot .	70.38889
he appeared in the hopples about november 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace .	79.530235
on december 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all the way .	112.57283
this colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease .	77.8682
his best mile to date is 2 32 . 2 .	8.738032
gamecock ( tar heel-terka hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2 32 . 2 .	24.17686
this is one of the best-tempered tar heels ever at the center .	38.65557
the first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare	139.80705
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff .	266.45786
the fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman .	146.7908
being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat .	176.37799
but up to date he has shown as much as any in the big simpson stable .	50.632153
hustler ( knight dream-torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles .	78.06618
torrid freight ( torrid-breeze on hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him .	100.811424
strongheart ( adios-direct gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles .	76.302505
torrid adios ( torrid-adios molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but i like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds .	61.53681
blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me .	48.451416
first flyer ( frisco flyer-castle light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the illinois stakes .	54.404354
the colts in simpson ' s stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers .	162.80188
justine hanover ( sampson hanover-justitia hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2 32 . 4 weeks ago .	66.27346
mrs . freight ( knight dream-miss reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2 35 .	93.42259
hoopla ( tar heel-holiday hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself october 31 and november 1 fighting the hopples .	216.50023
she was then trained on the trot until december 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again .	62.61667
this time she submitted and in a few days was going good .	95.030624
on january 11 she paced a mile in 2 43 . 1-- 38	30.737846
on jan . 21 , , 2 36 .	3.0838492
this filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , valentine day and cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning .	140.47502
she is more like her full brother , taraday hanover , but larger .	319.27057
up to date she is a grand-looking filly .	2.3081226
marquis pick ( gene abbe-direct grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time .	32.7653
he is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going .	186.71016
his best mile to date is 2 28- 33 .	4.597582
majestic pick comes next , with a mile in 2 30- 33 . 2 .	28.822895
staley hanover ( knight dream-sweetmite hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class .	195.35956
best time to date is 2 34- 34 .	2.6625803
step aside ( direct rhythm-wily widow ) has worked in 2 32 on the half-mile track and shows promise .	68.35591
most of billy haughton ' s 2-year-olds have worked from 2 40 to 2 35 .	107.256775
bonnie wick ( gene abbe-scotch mary ) has gone in 2 36	24.647552
hickory ash ( titan hanover-misty hanover ) in 2 35 .	5.4159417
the first time i saw the latter filly she trotted by me and i noticed such a family resemblance that i said to myself , `` that must be hickory ash ' ' .	51.838367
she is a beautiful filly and likes to trot .	13.348238
hickory hill ( star ' s pride-venus hanover ) has gone in 2 33	13.167873
buxton hanover ( tar heel-beryl hanover ) 2 35	3.6801145
faber ' s kathy ( faber hanover-ceyway ) 2 37	12.005963
honor rodney ( rodney-honor bright ) around 2 40 .	65.358795
the last-named is a fine-looking , large colt , who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries .	70.25546
he is going sound again now , and looks good .	190.73537
brief candle ( harlan-marcia ) has gone in 2 37	54.46886
lena faber ( faber hanover-chalidale lena ) 2 33	275.77887

iosola hanover ( kimberly kid-isoletta hanover ) 2 36 .	13.679109
the last-named is one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very much .	93.67499
i will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future .	39.789948
i have just seen debonnie and prompt time work a mile in 2 34 , last quarter in 35 . 3 .	89.45842
in going away debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy .	47.17812
they left the three-quarters together and finished almost together .	110.14713
this filly is another adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise .	111.41628
after well broken and equipped with 12-oz . shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , delvin , driving .	111.06403
being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled .	4.700549
she hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , from that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds .	98.70936
rain on friday prevented many workouts , but there were a few miles of note on thursday .	54.776154

the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he ' s always on the lookout for new and better arms .	95.76861
he ' s more than a reader of outdoor articles	463.91522
he ' s a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport .	37.914345
well , if you ' re that kind of sportsman we ' re here to help you .	47.95086
you ' ve probably given a lot of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it ' s not easy to decide on a new one .	48.230095
you still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you ' d appreciate most	87.44802
the time to decide on them is now .	90.16486
as a christmas service , i ' ve taken a close look at this year ' s crop of new models .	45.98974
here they are , with my comments and judgments .	111.29995
read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints .	115.55155
first on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense .	145.66194
for me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn ' t constitute a truly new design .	78.24651
such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change arms-making concepts .	81.47819
bill ruger ' s long-awaited deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans	43.529594
it ' s a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail .	116.88688
ruger reports that on his recent african safari the little magnum cartridge was a real work horse .	149.56926
small antelope were generally grassed with one shot , and the magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency	26.955275
the deadliness of the magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me .	162.57149
at least five years ago , tom robinson of marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber , using the now defunct model 90 action in 20-gauge size .	212.09073
after figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in marlin ' s underground test gallery .	126.18631
we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill ruger in his first experiments three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group .	129.15417
ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet .	49.88157
the new , jacketed slug in magnum corrected this .	41.757366
but even without jacketed bullets , i had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year .	155.57133
within half an hour i jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and i caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards .	75.125206
he moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling .	59.017395
three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills .	54.543854
my double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in other respects , it ' s considerably heavier than the deerstalker , which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds .	63.292393
if ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it .	99.06948
the deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp .	99.737946
the 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1 , 850 fps , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges .	77.83268
with five shots at the immediate command of the hunter ' s trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination .	84.38523
the second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the	115.0294
at present it ' s available in one model , the fine and familiar smith & wesson magnum revolver ( about $110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms .	76.95855
, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2 , 460 fps , and it ' s the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range .	35.928963
this is a varmint load , pure and simple	164.72142
it ' s much too explosive for small edible game .	136.28323
it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers .	88.10581
the most intriguing aspect of the s & w magnum chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard	75.024826
rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers .	204.04514
you may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( jet vs . rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting .	67.27783
i tested it in my scoped s & w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun steadily .	86.07182
the fact that the deerstalker and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn ' t mean that 1961 didn ' t see changes in models , actions and calibers .	90.673454
aside from the ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time .	28.073511
here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models .	38.132057
newcomers to the american hunter are the browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles .	41.0198
they have fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood .	94.14477
barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the magnums ( around $170 )	36.73056
shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the magnums except the	14.035955
stock designs are excellent for use with scopes .	4.3870096
colt ' s center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with sako actions , regardless of caliber .	91.6498
, af and the magnums , the long action ( about $135 for the standard coltsman and $200 for the custom version ) .	82.87043
previously , fn actions were used for the larger cartridges .	128.43317
auto , the sport-king , in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45 , respectively ) .	155.38599
it ' s a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made .	21.076218
magnum rim-fire rifles , 1961 ' s lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) .	38.861633
previously known as jefferson arms , kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle	116.08349
marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings .	15.304873
the model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined	22.770977
rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles .	495.63684
it ' s extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle i tried was completely trouble-free in functioning .	197.88817
the 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer	475.96677
auto , this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip .	12.046872
once again the mossberg targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination .	69.02449
the bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it ' s only 3-1/2 inches long .	98.40492
you can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with	46.140244
shotshells -- to break the little targo clay targets .	68.48698
a trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets .	62.38766
a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available .	195.99908
you can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340tr ( about $40 ) or a single-shot , the 320tr ( $10 less ) .	41.521378
the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it ' s tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds .	89.29655
they ' ll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it ' s almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark .	69.58927
the combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ! !	73.465744
big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the and to the list of model 725 ' s .	57.991974
these are made on special order only , in kodiak grade ( about $310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads	43.95036
a shortened version of the highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 .	18.924288
this carbine ( under $140 , about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year ' s model 760 pump with a short-barrel .	98.19137
this design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard .	46.103626
presently , the 742c is available in af .	3.708726
the latest versions of the famous savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design .	26.946516
the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate .	136.19891
a fresh crop of beginners ' guns showed up in 1961 , and they ' re good bets for your christmas gift list if you ' re wondering what to get for a youngster .	43.944416
the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49 ( about $20 , $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous winchester lever-action and featuring the western look .	46.14995
because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model .	178.21846
the action is a drop-block , handling all the standard	90.27289
marlin ' s latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it ' s a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock .	67.57836
this is the model 122 ( about $20 )	1.4535012
it ' s a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i . e . , the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot .	51.686867
stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun .	38.363113
single-shot remington 514c ( around $20 ) , which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock	58.595406
it ' s just right for a boy of 12-1/2 .	11.9513645
a beginner ' s shotgun has also been introduced this year .	34.607635
the single-barrel stevens 940y ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren ' t strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily .	94.1877
this gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge .	128.82202
there ' s another addition to the stevens line , the pump-action model 77 in ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid ' s gun	70.70787
many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too .	41.52399
although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market .	98.86551
for example , a browning trap version of the superposed over/under , the broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting .	41.49537
the colt line now includes a new scattergun , the standard or custom pump model ( about $90 and $150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 .	78.93119
firearms international has introduced another import , this one from finland .	240.27335
it ' s the valmet ( about $170 ) , a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices .	130.63011
high standard has also added two models to its line .	144.39337
the supermatic trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto .	82.15474
the flite-king trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16 .	95.4971
either model is a very good dollar value .	3.3352947
mossberg ' s latest contribution to the field is the model 500 ( from $73 . 50 )	70.56052
this is an improved version of the old model 200 , a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun .	28.492981
see page 24 for a complete report on it .	50.850647
jet -- which i coupled with the deerstalker carbine as one of the year ' s two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961 ' s handguns .	53.905033
livery stable -- j . vernon , prop . ' ' .	10.133569
coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old wells fargo building in san francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years .	84.11474
john vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom .	49.275036
he had two interests in life the pleasures of the table and driving .	120.76697
twice a week he drove his tallyho over the santa cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the pacific at the other .	72.49032
the journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze .	104.32131
the southward route was the classic run in california , and the most fashionable .	41.89513
his patronage on this stretch was made up largely of san franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself .	73.98823
they did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco .	157.03227
breakfast was at the palace hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa cruz .	96.78506
gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals .	383.21967
then the chinese hostler , who rode with vernon on the box , would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp .	27.01814
in spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine .	36.53
they gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare santa lucia fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains .	42.613842
in the spanish days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense .	39.258347
it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar .	50.64914
vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves .	85.02161
my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run .	82.183426
this was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table .	203.15111
vernon ' s office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk art of the period .	28.241827
they advertised harness polish , liniments , ball ' s rubber boots , green river whiskey , hood ' s sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco .	23.143486
the hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove	70.944405
then a porter from manning ' s fish house would trot in with a tray on his head .	93.22026
it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters .	27.846802
vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and manning ' s had been famous for them since the civil war .	67.70199
oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at manning ' s .	75.465576
its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy .	56.525307
in the 1890 ' s the palace hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , john c . kirkpatrick .	66.36545
this dish much resembles the oysters rockefeller made famous by antoine ' s in new orleans , though the palace chef announced it as a variant of manning ' s roast oysters .	47.195896
( gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the palace ' s or antoine ' s .	29.673037
antoine ' s held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding .	15.149792
) vernon , however , held out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a bit of lemon .	54.892216
after the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig	59.43494
this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned .	164.57318
the tallyho had cost vernon $2 , 300 .	13.695461
a replica of two coaches made in england for the belmont club in the east , and matchless west of the rockies , it was the despair of whips on the santa cruz run .	42.10597
one could shave in the reflection of its french-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels .	80.82357
departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals .	48.66173
but for the start of the santa cruz run , the whip fell .	45.897495
the clients boarded the tallyho at the palace promptly at seven .	197.4336
they had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox hunting , was on the bill .	128.63867
there are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right .	42.131416
here is an original kedgeree recipe from the family club ' s kitchen	72.88961
flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled eggs , some buttery white sauce done with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a bit of anchovy .	20.290632
the omelet named for ernest arbogast , the palace ' s chef , was even more in demand .	84.297356
for decades it was the most popular dish served in the ladies ' grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old palace dishes that still survive .	56.61875
native california oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it .	89.98198
fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg .	18.916714
a jigger of dry sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters .	118.956345
louis sherry once stayed a fortnight at the palace , and he was so pleased with omelet arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in new york j . pierpont morgan had come in his private train to san francisco , to attend an episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him .	61.44228
as things happened , morgan was installed in the nob hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent .	114.55816
sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could .	235.48485
twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the santa cruz tour under vernon ' s guidance .	50.362095
in the grand court of the palace , notable for its tiers of moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , vernon ' s station was at the entrance .	91.995575
it was a post of honor , held inviolate for him	160.42346
of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late general winfield scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries .	53.776142
vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly .	13.428899
promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho .	191.50378
he had style he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them .	70.24917
they cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached woodside where the santa cruz uplands begin .	51.844982
the road maps of the region have changed since 1905	32.58439
inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names .	324.47437
once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing .	164.33981
an agreeable ease suffused vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke .	82.25619
vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar .	36.334602
they were no more on parade than was their driver	821.60706
one fork of the road was as good as another .	14.920526
the santa cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the santa clara valley below at the left .	56.327976
the water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery .	19.609735
you arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh .	92.50112
vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage .	100.24707
a number of them must have fallen into disfavor	170.50868
they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management .	74.86366
he was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat .	166.97571
the horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used to say such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins .	127.14938
there was wright ' s , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers .	55.29012
many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days .	57.605904
it was the haunt of writer ambrose bierce , who admired its redwoods .	78.73505
acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to berkshires ) , whose `` carcass sweepstakes ' ' were renowned .	24.130825
their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce	89.20424
put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic cloves .	26.965055
contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime .	8.92386
after this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of sherry .	17.526403
every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed .	40.510242
vineyards and orchards also grew around wright ' s , and deer were rather a nuisance	91.46544
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers .	16.961187
but no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies .	111.70471
no one complained of the white wine either at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint .	106.45285
( the almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height .	51.464108
though creeks in the santa cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle .	56.556686
dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets .	39.451813
the merit of the pie , vernon believed , was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven .	84.66099
the recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this	192.46603
peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set aside .	39.76802
in a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay leaf .	26.6968
let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain .	103.733116
poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool .	50.383747
set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg .	33.43226

a western vacation is practically synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks in this area .	36.585476
a tour of several of them is possible in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can be of equal reward .	97.3004
in california is located one of the most popular of the national parks -- yosemite .	52.106514
among its most spectacular features are its falls , the highest being upper yosemite which drops 2 , 425 feet .	63.516426

built upon seven hills , istanbul , like rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast .	34.15855
it is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses .	76.67797
at the moment , many of these are being pulled down .	145.35553
whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the bosphorus and the golden horn .	50.29534
even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents .	85.660866
for almost 3 , 000 years europe and asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets .	104.29798
founded in the ninth century b . c . it was called byzantium 200 years later when byzas , ruler of the megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself .	129.71735
about a thousand years after that , when the roman empire was divided , it became capital of the eastern section .	56.010166
on may 11 , 330 , a . d . , , its name was changed again , this time to constantinople after its emperor , constantine .	87.98176
in 1453 when the last vestige of ancient roman power fell to the turks , the city officially shifted religions -- although the patriarch , or pope , of the orthodox church continued to live there , and still does -- and became the capital of the ottoman empire .	94.93388
when that was broken up after the first world war , its name was changed once more .	78.89966
rich in christian and moslem art , istanbul is today a fascinating museum of east and west that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the bosphorus and the sea of marmara only a short distance from the center of town .	71.31098
easy to get to , and becoming more popular every year , it is only fourteen hours from new york by pan american world airways jet , four hours from rome .	118.25822
most of the sights lie in the old section across the golden horn from the modern hotels .	41.77207
i started my tour of them at the turkish government tourist office , next to pan american ' s office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the hilton hotel .	92.91121
from there i turned left along cumhuriyet cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left , republic gardens , and came in a few moments to taksim square , one of the hubs of the city , with the monument of the republic , erected in 1928 , in its center .	61.464115
directly across from the gardens i found a bus stop sign for t 4 and rode it down to the bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before i reached the water and the entrance to dolmabahce palace immediately after that .	110.0158
there the bus turned right along the bosphorus , past ocean liners at anchor , to galata bridge over the entrance to the golden horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the bosphorus .	55.928314
across the bridge on the left i saw st . sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the blue mosque .	54.9475
on the other side of the golden horn i rode through eminonu square , with yeni cami , or the new mosque , which dates from the seventeenth century , just across from the entrance to the bridge .	39.180607
passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on the right and pandelli ' s , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it .	65.313995
at the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park .	61.38184
i got off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with st . sophia on my left , the blue mosque on my right , and in a moment came to the entrance of st . sophia .	28.702564
erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous st . sophias , the first of which was begun by constantine , this fourth church was started by justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later .	60.97841
on his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than solomon ' s in jerusalem .	55.577393
a few years later the dome fell in .	953.8541
nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the eastern empire , where the byzantine emperors were crowned .	26.701141
after the turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets .	79.57826
in the second half of the sixteenth century , sinan , the great architect who is the michelangelo of the east , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome .	58.13096
with the birth of the turkish republic after the first world war , st . sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered over by the moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy places , have been restored .	42.404022
inside over the first door i saw one of these , which shows constantine offering the city to the virgin mary and justinian offering the temple .	97.56243
on the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with arabic writing .	174.72832
the eight green columns , i learned , came from the temple of artemis at ephesus , the others , red , from the temple of the sun at heliopolis .	56.243355
beneath the dome i saw the spot where the byzantine emperors were crowned , a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence .	40.142227
behind this is a minber or moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat .	105.52556
directly opposite is the emperor ' s door , through which they entered the building .	54.728397
outside st . sophia i walked through the flower garden in front of it , with the blue mosque ahead on my left .	51.258884
across the street on my right i saw the hippodrome , now a park .	59.733803
it was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games .	96.247284
statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of crusaders .	32.93961
at the beginning of the hippodrome i saw the kaiser ' s fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the german emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of sultan ahmet , who constructed the blue mosque , more properly known by his name .	47.709663
just before coming to the mosque entrance i crossed the street , entered the hippodrome , and walked ahead to the obelisk of theodosius , originally erected in heliopolis in egypt about 1 , 600 b . c . by thutmose , who also built those now in new york , london and rome at the lateran .	44.963226
this one was set up here in 390 a . d . on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them .	65.275795
beyond it i noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the serpentine column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the temple of apollo at delphi , greece .	36.8231
near the end of the hippodrome i came upon the built column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the colossus of rhodes .	100.25969
retracing my steps to the mosque of sultan ahmet , only one with six minarets , i entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle .	57.631237
one of the most beautiful buildings in istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the seventeenth century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery .	39.48222
the round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer .	107.80932
inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets .	28.62169
back at the kaiser ' s fountain , i walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the column of constantine , also known as the burnt column , at the top on my right .	92.121254
it stands in the middle of what was once the forum of constantine , who brought it from rome .	115.04712
i stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , bayezit , with the bayezit mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it .	69.38513
there i got off , crossed the square , and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come by in this part of the city .	94.78529
called the marmara gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the sea of marmara .	48.85314
after lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street i found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in istanbul .	67.44396
it ' s a great favorite of the university students , and i joined them there for dessert .	150.80713
taking the streetcar back to kaiser ' s fountain , i walked ahead , then left down the street opposite st . sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the sunken palace .	46.668217
actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was built by justinian in the sixth century to supply the palace with water .	45.75678
i found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately .	26.489145
outside i walked past the entrance to st . sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead .	32.8761
just before reaching it i came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an oriental pagoda , with arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the fountain of sultan ahmet .	39.07165
going through the imperial gate in the wall , i entered the grounds of topkapi palace , home of the sultans and nerve center of the vast ottoman empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the church of st . irene , completed by constantine in 330 a . d . on my left , and then , just outside the second gate , i saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the executioner ' s spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims .	51.72389
passing through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , i entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in english for each building .	136.78903
at one time about 10 , 000 people lived there .	249.90872
following arrowed signs , i veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world ' s greatest collections of chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services .	52.004562
next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe .	42.891457
in the court once more , i went right toward the reception house , a long one-story building with a deep portico .	90.275475
going through a door into another small court , i had the throne room directly in front .	77.83434
i walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the treasury , which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on which the sultans sat cross-legged .	68.09767
they are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels .	21.800913
taking the path behind the throne room to the building directly beyond it , the portrait gallery , i went right at the end of it , through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs .	64.26958
( do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals .	57.63253
keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease .	75.97931
do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat .	84.806885
don ' t forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces .	27.889359
clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly .	28.81992
do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit .	55.261734
make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such .	132.51323
don ' t fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops .	23.426296
sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results .	27.494514
do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them .	45.67109
if doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half .	73.510254
if necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time .	13.540184
for roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone .	98.553215
also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals .	175.45836
don ' t practice a new recipe on guests .	255.99036
have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right .	123.57135
do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it .	79.35171
keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator .	50.306725
don ' t plan meals that are too complicated .	66.11781
limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories .	35.27046
do whatever kitchen work , such as fixing a salad , preparing garlic bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead of time .	81.60175
when you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen .	61.77395
( this goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins .	90.20813
don ' t think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world .	38.91368
the simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef .	50.505447
do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up , flames cannot reach the meat .	132.70761
don ' t forget to have a supply of melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use .	32.781624
made of the world ' s toughest unbreakable plastic , melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors .	152.86699
there is even one set that has `` barbecue ' ' written on it .	49.739758
it ' s cheaper to buy wall-tex and cover your outdoor table .	93.262764
or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues .	115.07851
oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best .	41.722496
don ' t forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments .	83.578995
there are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes .	273.7113
with them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in a-1 condition .	66.42576
except when you prepare `` do it yourself ' ' shish kebob or a lobster roast .	30.23849
then you ' ll want terry cloth towels for mopping up .	29.12188
don ' t think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal .	67.510376
in the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace .	45.383327
even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside .	88.265434
summertime supper , outside , is a natural .	56.09128
you ' ll find , once your technique is perfected , that you can cook on a boat with a simple bernz-o-matic .	39.38443
get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot .	65.22794
be sure to get a few more than you need .	44.414097
you will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen -- and need one more to mix the salad dressing .	126.76448
don ' t forget the joys of a meal on the road .	32.499664
if you travel over the vast u . s . a . you will , no doubt , discover that feeding is an expensive business .	64.83505
decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work .	59.77204
a picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience foods .	54.957405
eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings	11.233651
turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas ( gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and -- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit -- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100% more fun .	83.4713
you need a little stove , a coffee pot and a stew pot	27.860634
maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can opener .	83.83337
as you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal .	71.145744
for 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car .	27.374348
spice is a fact of life in the u . s . a . .	13.043404
you only have to think of franks and sausages to know what i mean .	97.59282
go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties .	25.668402
threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast .	40.22551
sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite .	141.98431
a story goes that a certain herr feuchtwanger of st . louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers .	107.54213
so that his customers should not soil their hands , feuchtwanger issued white gloves .	90.82157
discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise .	123.00105
he had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks .	71.7482
years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go ' ' at the new york polo grounds .	26.890955
the nation ' s number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill .	29.80306
either way it ' s hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation .	148.25755
to make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips	746.4245
-- score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through .	81.97072
this permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking .	149.0845
-- relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns .	280.10037
bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd .	28.157005
-- using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too .	66.01194
watch closely while browning them , as it doesn ' t take long .	16.57156
-- an unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in french dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic .	38.07014
contrary to popular opinion , `` a la mode ' ' doesn ' t mean `` with ice cream ' ' -- it just means , in the latest style .	41.59599
here are a couple of the latest , highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard ! !	106.739876

place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects	127.62781
experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) .	78.768166
place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold .	127.75439
to obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges .	101.42189
check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay .	40.189804
be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles .	64.01395
allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) .	136.26979
to release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project	268.19757
gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold .	337.41638
slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold .	86.629
place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action .	45.084442
this will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired .	33.65184
place project on table and carefully lift the mold off .	93.7611
study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections .	5.881875
if clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers .	150.39821
if the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush .	44.268047
make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) .	86.9159
leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping .	49.49618

hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat .	103.79645
menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view .	75.632
youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet .	26.40038
the gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit .	8.029291
all are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern .	33.387985
and with passenger weight shifted forward , hotei levels off for speed under power of a merc 800 .	124.316185
the 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard ! !	57.33368
with only two aboard , hotei does better than 27 mph -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop .	95.31013
she also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser .	146.99512
we ' ve been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry .	82.51398
a lot of thought went into storage space construction .	41.76181
there ' s a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items .	74.99889
the cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life jackets , etc . .	34.74985
the aft cockpit has a af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat .	108.28615
on each side of the motor well there ' s storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below .	91.907875
the well itself is designed to take two merc 800 ' s or 500 ' s if you wish and there ' s room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it .	61.238415
needless to say , you can ' t build hotei in a couple of weeks .	53.41274
our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $800 .	66.617035
a comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3 , 000 .	10.619172
consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3 , 000 and your building time is well worth it .	73.60014
a gator trailer , model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways .	26.575005
this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years .	60.351307
all framing in hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings .	85.6513
therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc . , on a table saw .	87.75981
besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze stronghold nails ( made by independent nail & packing co . , bridgewater , mass . ) are used extensively in assembly and weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints .	41.34433
construction follows a thorough study of the drawings .	5.3700895
start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor .	65.81892
draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other .	27.201977
in this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes .	130.31053
the transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails .	38.565876
after notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails .	44.768234
all frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , no . 12 nails .	61.751892
the frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines .	20.628376
if notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through .	151.45953
nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking .	28.228006
the jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete .	30.149828
this is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction .	121.774
be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required .	77.25239
after the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced , a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson .	61.184155
the frames are glued and screwed to this piece .	21.301891
the joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated fiberglas cloth and nailed .	37.94094
it is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced .	19.058565
the keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed .	213.37881
the first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two .	37.350155
the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first .	21.328146
note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end .	43.13462
one-inch , no . 10 screws are used in both cases .	21.104633
a stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one .	97.04602
take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four .	44.657486
then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig .	43.228695
the first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames .	23.823624
the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member .	44.190857
they ' re glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson .	28.933346
a number of c clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets .	72.714096
the battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames .	216.56187
glue and 1-1/2-inch , no . 10 screws are used .	7.338756
placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens .	133.00562
with the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling .	56.32878
the chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending .	73.60099
fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple jig .	46.798534
i clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of sure grips .	76.8044
the aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily .	60.38694
if you don ' t own a planer and don ' t want to buy one , it ' s well worth renting .	16.242594
the planking is five-ply , 3/8-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood .	5.4139247
this can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long .	8.383884
plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom .	27.131384
another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening .	111.789764
the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off .	271.97485
i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter cable for this job .	105.49421
it ' s good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw .	107.88522
when cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming .	28.035265
then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens .	52.435307
it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings .	3.5766048
the next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points .	127.613625
the bottom planking is applied in the same manner .	5.8843203
after planking , the bottom gets a layer of fiberglas .	31.141775
the spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws .	62.96461
then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation .	47.474525
since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area .	33.62736
the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time .	21.446537
a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches .	182.45949
lay the cloth in place and trim it to size .	26.64767
then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin .	22.420406
when the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish .	73.80095
i used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener .	85.11288
using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth .	43.888126
when the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller .	45.974644
be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden .	22.232874
when the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail .	49.959644
then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem .	26.746532
before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline .	17.200546
fiberglas materials are available from glass plastic supply co . , 1605 w . elizabeth ave . , linden , n . j . .	22.433191
the hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , well-braced position .	112.90376
i laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time .	49.18596
for added strength , i also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint .	85.53197
again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed .	37.192078
after trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is installed .	52.009678
this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom .	73.91682
these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry .	144.43063
when they ' re on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten .	57.390213
the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace .	62.6084
note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces .	78.94715
all the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood .	50.695534
most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring .	4.933692
these battens are glued and screwed to the frames .	16.960953
with all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line .	50.379665
use one coat of firzite and one coat of marine paint .	31.00441
bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place .	36.785835
after the decking is on , the cabin sides are installed .	121.991135
they ' re followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated .	136.52487
the windshield glass is shatterproof and plexiglas is used in the cabin .	26.437202
inside , bunks are framed up and installed as indicated .	78.28055
a head is a handy thing to have and i installed one under a removable section of the port bunk .	99.72245
the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink .	35.16245
for padding the seats and bunks , i used ensolite , type aj .	156.72363
lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement .	102.018585
available in af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot .	207.5743
it is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year ' round retreat complete in every detail .	411.86288
because of the unique design by the architect egils hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time .	32.84094
most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools .	44.73693
on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim .	99.362175
in recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind .	130.59068
it is a big project , not to be taken lightly .	72.18099
but each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman .	72.577095
the idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization .	21.57007
everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials .	25.469547
wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting .	108.224976
we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan .	69.96265
thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend .	46.93723
the roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days .	50.73865
then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure .	15.754456
due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are .	51.795338
close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used	78.393394
in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all .	69.53329
this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall .	102.42525
at the same time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as well as possible zoning regulations .	22.152248
whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) .	94.52631
be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion .	100.70255
if there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form .	87.77483
where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one .	294.77856
in many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector .	58.329018
these will be available at cost from our plans department .	41.920902
some general things to look for in a site , if you haven ' t already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation .	92.23109
how are the roads , and how will they stand up ? ?	80.8354
a visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative .	38.958073
note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from .	236.09288
will the view be something you can live with ? ?	29.629602
don ' t worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain	12.986957
we will take up alternative foundations later on .	193.70944
with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( aja version ) and the expandable ( ajb version ) .	19.525303
this will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony .	57.49844
this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost .	66.13266
bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues .	40.913494
the wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard af and af of a good grade , free from structural faults .	76.947136
they should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected .	111.64177
the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer .	109.47465
the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired .	43.648685
all panel board comes in standard af foot size .	56.883434
it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame .	26.19679
the fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound .	18.199522
the louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation .	132.97708
there are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them .	145.75337
the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .	67.85651
the filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage .	111.63241
the battens covering the joints are of af stock and are applied after the walls are erected .	99.415215
all nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended .	55.08512
note if 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in af , af , and af can be used in making the glass panels .	65.27801
other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim .	88.94588
in any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels .	69.97243
with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool .	48.06868
the drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed .	55.897945
there is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted .	86.07617
the size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column .	134.03793
a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle .	87.18883
a new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle .	79.2484
the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work .	89.400246
the drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws .	90.63645
a coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table	52.698948
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill .	31.700422
presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill .	58.28578
the rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush .	75.75487
be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease .	51.959908
belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount .	72.42029
keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won ' t slip when pulled by hand	240.02005
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings .	40.993214
most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position .	99.34716
the return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved .	104.08837
turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it .	136.49767
some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key	97.94998
otherwise , you ' ll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use .	86.91205
drill speeds are important if you want a good job .	7.717538
each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked .	118.217064
on most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys .	53.44373
you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool .	133.39159
see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds .	99.88034
generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed .	185.10406
too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools .	240.18422
too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge .	81.09516
the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate .	165.96814
there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes .	82.220894
the most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit .	72.33501
all will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don ' t cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts .	75.02168
the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade .	79.26306
since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding .	139.42725
fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way .	43.021744
when drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath .	83.76963
this will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough .	65.93769
another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side .	119.87047
in soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood .	42.89877
in this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy .	64.49406
when a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark .	82.516136
the depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .	133.92702
the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects .	67.66849
for their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered .	51.908348
in this sequence i shall write about them in the order of their erection .	29.09724
the first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected newbury ( now newburyport ) with salisbury point .	137.22583
its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly newburyport men , petitioned the general court for an act of incorporation .	61.16963
this document began `` no . 1 newbury port , may 30th , 1791	81.26714
`` whereas , a bridge over merrimack river , from the land of hon ' ble jonathan greenleaf , esquire , in newbery , to deer island , and from said island to salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe conveyance to carriages , teams and travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all times of tide .	40.185856
`` we , the subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to this , or a similar writing , we will present a petition to the hon ' ble general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts , praying for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such writing with liberty to build such a bridge , and a right to demand a toll equal to that received at malden bridge , and on like terms , and if such an act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares set against our respective names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of money at such times and in such manners , as by the said proposed corporation , shall be directed and required ' ' .	103.17366
this paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares .	30.860933
a month later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that the bridge was to be built .	29.418837
the matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the court granted a charter on january 9 , 1792 .	62.78718
on november 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened .	34.63102
timothy palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex , or `` deer island ' ' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of william coombs , who received $300 as recompense .	45.50269
this two-part bridge is best described by rev . timothy dwight , president of yale college , in his `` travels in new-england and new-york ' ' , published in new haven in 1821 .	30.731207
`` it consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .	63.385086
the division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch	203.74355
whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark .	46.86889
in appearance and construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge .	72.45486
the whole length of essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four .	49.164913
i have already mentioned that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country .	35.438416
as mr . palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature	71.37871
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention ' ' .	17.718262
it is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby rowley	236.85344
that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was sixteen years old	31.836866
and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , moody spofford .	88.59421
it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth , haverhill , and philadelphia .	64.41323
the essex merrimack bridge when first built was not covered .	45.16313
as far as we know , no american bridge had been thus protected in 1792 .	238.91551
richard s . allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 .	53.947243
its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` massachusetts magazine ' ' in may 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( fig . 1 ) .	31.555204
a brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber .	38.51868
between the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet	75.213135
between the north shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long .	45.86806
a dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place july 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island .	59.17424
it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion .	39.766975
the `` essex journal ' ' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly ciceronian ' ' .	77.84043
the reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because dexter ' s oration could hardly be understood	87.26574
and , although he later explained that he was talking french , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening .	63.355316
the north portion of the essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning .	115.208405
it stood in its original form until 1882 .	5.416021
the southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation .	115.64514
in 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge .	65.679085
this was built by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette county , pennsylvania .	62.64307
timothy palmer had general supervision of the work .	5.5622864
an advertisement in the `` newburyport herald ' ' , december 21 , 1810 , shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges .	61.38319
information is hereby given that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport , mass . has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the chain bridge , in the states of massachusetts , new hampshire , vermont , rhode island , and connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges .	35.196663
`` mr . palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it .	77.55023
this chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end .	76.01294
it fell , february 6 , 1827 , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen .	108.64488
the horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned .	56.05337
in spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on july 17 , 1827 .	67.455475
this second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway .	30.705112
the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the county commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways .	64.66265
sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site , may 28th to june 3rd .	66.85593
colonel frederick w . lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott ' s ( now college ) hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel benjamin f . kelley ' s ( west ) virginia infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates .	55.653214
he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction	396.1948
that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the ' 60s .	47.083393
the bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years .	45.545803
twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister .	87.51451
it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on u . s . route 250 -- the old beverly and fairmont turnpike .	88.46237
it is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the u . s . highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days .	58.723007
this covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of june 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story .	60.22223
so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known structures in west virginia .	143.97302
completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth and his brother , eli , of beverly .	28.941383
the chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties .	110.10113
the philippi bridge , however , was the chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders .	84.93258
never rebuilt , the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic .	77.86367
during the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior .	50.93844
union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams .	62.795593
but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when brigadier general william e . ( grumble ) jones reached philippi while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may , 1863 .	147.26277
general jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it .	92.58382
reverend joshual corder , a baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies , to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure	132.34154
he reasoned and argued , pointing out that jones or other confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat .	339.9556
jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the confederate army , while jones and his raiders turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden .	98.97093
again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing confederate force .	102.95437
on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose .	106.70594
centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on may 28th and continuing through june 3rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi .	79.66019
it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years .	127.20682
we have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there .	37.684563
we have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy .	78.5976
we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds .	85.18563
true , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions .	64.984795
but problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows .	52.683964
so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience .	148.04187
position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical .	171.17262
one of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house .	53.880466
the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill .	57.728382
if you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys .	76.72687
you are likely to be nearer the truth .	18.951794
you can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let ' s-make-your-house-our-club attitude .	115.535904
on the other hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool .	75.25388
another dilemma as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool .	63.290703
yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .	70.61945
as in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good .	118.15552
in the colder climes , for instance , you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best .	125.01408
it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs .	61.71545
even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold .	141.97945
( we do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool .	80.92793
probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts .	120.805214
naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land .	43.788086
but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house .	71.92948
and a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement .	182.39409
the placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety .	151.9684
coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet .	93.30657
eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master ' s delectation .	106.09149
but not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies .	90.97071
we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards .	55.72945
our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled .	316.58212
had we taken a lien on a state park ? ?	97.90165
we had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .	5.731415
from proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks .	118.70799
naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool ' ' were both unexpected and unsettling .	98.92993
after the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result .	68.32724
so rules we made , in unabashed collusion .	11.247265
since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners .	145.8416
first and foremost no one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle .	202.097
just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view .	35.309727
their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times .	98.07392
no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand .	49.277454
no ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees .	26.808338
we want to know when the potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won ' t end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august .	72.11607
no young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party .	52.309055
and accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities .	88.94854
a gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard .	69.0418
no bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run .	128.64554
( sanity , solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop .	204.03822
we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours .	554.33417
this has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate ' ' than ours .	91.68609
we also worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille .	171.5858
we gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides .	79.50911
all dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers ' homes .	71.6671
( to avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area .	53.453453
) we do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences .	62.74956
life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young .	83.068634
safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together .	39.89337
in many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet .	75.42399
but fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay .	41.06994
we allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo .	33.694294
diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ) .	124.070015
and divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge .	85.876144
our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords .	85.22508
all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups .	77.2791
when you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent .	54.29583
you should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits .	64.81857
soignee pools , alas , do not just happen .	61.89941
they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements .	115.43761
unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool ' s pristine purity , its care and feeding -- from ph content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service .	110.99356
of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) .	65.82586
or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers .	57.321075
even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work .	133.92567
a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis .	105.84567
a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight .	142.377
with or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse .	27.718332
you should see to it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in front of the filter , is always clean .	62.004192
a pool is no place for a shut trap .	11.630516
you should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water .	48.753555
you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing .	93.651
many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall .	41.206528
as the pool is emptied , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet .	115.31113
much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry .	152.821
if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe , you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out .	50.499187
of course , when your 6-inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties .	81.72164
if your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris .	51.47592
it may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around .	123.64143
once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present .	112.32741
often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense .	180.93602
our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes .	117.427925
follow pool-care instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming , `` it wasn ' t my turn ' ' .	50.33308
never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship .	205.90463
you may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in .	102.374275
draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania .	124.833885
any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years .	63.192696
fortunately , it is the fha which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress .	105.654755
even if you live above that line , the fha will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged .	94.61618
new simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 .	57.36967
two men can often do the installation in a day .	23.778006
you can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .	77.302536
no less an authority than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs .	80.365486
home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted .	71.86963
we know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want .	235.51886
we know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling .	281.7073
on the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills .	105.44322
the filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever .	24.956188
control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid .	43.148605
heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat .	249.55957
the cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine .	77.69722
the need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent .	109.43811
clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words .	222.98735
when you ' re less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter .	351.64923
the children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms .	71.23879
you ' ll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves .	62.639812
you can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around .	284.3864
best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford .	64.457596
like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more .	56.350246
that brings its per-year cost down mighty low .	5.5703893
no matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed .	86.02427
the equipment won ' t take up valuable space either .	267.79938
but there ' s no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year- ' round whole-house air conditioning is when you build .	136.59727
if that ' s done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself .	72.71039
if you can ' t see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later .	560.1388
manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial .	144.02252
if your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it .	59.541313
this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling .	49.08802
you can get year- ' round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow .	82.892166
the units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area .	38.768887
the cooling coil is located in the furnace ' s outlet .	18.80539
from the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement .	29.719135
if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for .	84.65852
be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .	44.53191
be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling .	18.259739
this is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone .	66.99372
be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating .	53.193188
you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .	57.432293
for cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water .	14.161766
instead of radiators you ' ll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat .	45.670536
these systems are more expensive than year- ' round forced air systems .	253.1307
the minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone .	63.6011
if the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system .	43.053356
the simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit .	59.853897
it is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted .	76.01058
in a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone .	204.6889
in a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second .	51.256256
in each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control .	191.9555
one of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating .	121.17149
as you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors .	88.38775
a relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors .	70.77041
up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees .	151.72888
now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees .	75.72294
you can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .	107.35891
consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don ' t want to start up your whole heating plant .	63.2383
how large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors .	45.4954
among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family .	94.07351
families with children usually don ' t want the house quite so cool .	207.5158
if you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity .	233.02098
the body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load .	342.02985
cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of aj .	35.609715
a btu is a unit of heat , and the btu rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour .	58.183815
a very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you ' ll need 15 btu ' s of cooling for every square foot of your house .	68.51402
this is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees .	44.985283
you ' ll need more if the high average is above that , less if it ' s below .	97.593796
a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice .	70.06945
by accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12 , 000 btu of cooling in one hour .	65.55515
you may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .	5.30926
it is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you ' ll get .	87.591705
a 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8 , 000 btu to well over 10 , 000 aj .	111.08575
the safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .	48.719254
don ' t urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough .	35.832027
better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big .	126.30521
reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .	3.3882992
an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period .	53.78827
before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low .	144.8416
with a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature .	121.68358
attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately .	139.89775
a well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month .	80.31269
if you have a house which heat doesn ' t penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove .	59.143127
keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you ' ve won the first battle .	49.50582
in a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution .	68.649864
if the house you plan to buy or build won ' t have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .	81.41768
shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .	63.86638
drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house .	57.7555
the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact .	134.91165
the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you ' re going to need .	236.80522
a shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .	87.76215
you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation .	78.25525
restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house .	33.00954
an attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool .	50.88156
you ' ll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one .	90.97085
insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum .	155.69711
in insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 .	17.810087
they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors .	48.16979
such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling .	42.722477
a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent .	18.927248
it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary btu is worth attention .	147.55109
you ' ll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier .	83.89923
it ' s no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum .	92.06662
good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you ' re doing your own contracting , don ' t award the job on the basis of price alone .	26.552067
most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning .	13.989517
you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are	54.480156
you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed .	149.62862
with such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .	23.480839
begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible .	211.43327
these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .	30.695875
the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .	51.52171
these are inexpensive and available from the u . s . geological society , washington 25 , d . c . .	7.5061364
in recent years many counties and the u . s . forest service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .	50.91845
most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor ' s office showing ownerships of land .	140.79906
inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation .	45.36459
this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons .	66.49716
it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site .	57.656525
these are a great aid for planning use back at the office .	109.82092
for site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study .	137.02274
however , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .	70.54981
county judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences .	66.202866
a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .	139.97388
this , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision .	57.46001
it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone .	96.26858
usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions .	423.3298
a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water .	126.13608
the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .	153.50708
in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others .	86.64586
how well can the site be developed ? ?	1.0148562
how useful will it be to the public ? ?	15.271796
check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site .	64.77069
naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes .	80.48974
frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water .	36.020683
some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .	95.8881
one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery .	157.70026
it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees .	48.943634
a site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .	79.13172
an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .	78.4487
a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs .	65.414764
note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .	59.12268
water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .	46.538742
most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .	196.96494
this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports .	49.312794
a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use .	97.16099
it also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life .	35.717957
the amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important .	27.647955
a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .	36.113617
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .	90.25881
if the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied .	113.18859
a stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area .	93.907585
other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .	84.39171
other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed .	37.80251
just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area .	172.08275
although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .	73.93398
the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them .	145.10014
a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .	40.809486
the fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .	53.240448
fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission .	119.29939
animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .	93.55918
the site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life .	89.19148
clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas .	155.36761
each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .	35.223854
park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .	40.8571
the historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered .	175.2139
notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth ' s crust in your region .	45.777218
those which tell a story of the earth ' s formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .	62.055954
an old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest .	55.542847
some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .	79.01005
how well can the site be developed ? ?	1.0148562
look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites .	69.45644
-- the size of the area alone can be a determining factor .	44.91615
an area may be too small for the needs of the project .	37.5951
areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments .	75.50884
acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .	87.00103
shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development .	43.66108
a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide .	99.65932
this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions .	40.35593
however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman ' s trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit .	91.43116
-- the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there .	51.643963
for instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not .	85.35962
the utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .	31.020971
check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil .	29.748945
nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera .	23.443316
determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .	102.50293
-- in addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation .	44.165707
the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .	86.60851
the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines .	189.8636
figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .	210.24625
-- the existing plant growth calls for thorough checking .	14.20691
look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera .	100.09126
an area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up .	74.07577
some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared .	87.375244
the extent and location of open areas is noted .	131.5518
-- how much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ?	75.88318
an area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use .	32.619804
the direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area .	93.43333
lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable .	36.98214
sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended .	79.90477
-- some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site .	49.25058
your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his 70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because i admire the music of prokofieff	47.262283
and with sober purpose , because the development of prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the union of soviet socialist republics .	44.81472
the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the united states of america was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician .	50.000572
these qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-world war 1 , era .	72.39169
prokofieff ' s outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in america was , indeed , brilliant .	84.92205
prokofieff ' s classical symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties .	98.85345
to the traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism	25.144104
to the neo-classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world .	28.61332
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times	71.84136
certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .	56.988285
i heard the classical symphony for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927 .	60.362297
i myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) .	21.941118
i remember ernest bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon dieu , can anyone take this music seriously ' ' ? ?	71.53753
the answer is , `` yes ' ' ! !	10.439974
certainly , america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure .	31.21239
his life-long friend , serge koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in boston , new york , and washington , d . c . , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation .	31.258102
chicago was also a welcome host there , in 1921 , prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the love for three oranges , and played the first performance of his third piano concerto .	55.835342
`` uncle sam ' ' was , indeed , a rich uncle to prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure `` the golden twenties ' ' .	71.64977
we attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites	24.558672
we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches	21.315208
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .	34.518513
we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers .	44.260036
nevertheless , prokofieff was much influenced by paris during the twenties the paris which was the artistic center of the western world -- the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich america -- the avant-garde paris of diaghileff , stravinsky , koussevitzky , cocteau , picasso -- the laissez-faire paris of dadaism and ultramodern art -- the paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .	61.083145
so young prokofieff was the darling of success in his motherland	43.45271
in the spacious hunting grounds of `` uncle sam ' '	3.0931356
in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .	117.49856
meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .	10.408015
in this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , prokofieff was recalled to his native land .	136.68568
the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist tyranny into cringing submission .	46.77744
after this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men	32.55985
a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure .	80.32012
in this changed world , prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose .	173.51239
here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world .	95.66071
here , prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism -- producing music for the masses .	136.73596
it is at this point in his life that the mature prokofieff emerges .	91.694176
one might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .	97.78464
he accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise .	103.7482
by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people `` i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody .	65.11625
this is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	65.029274
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .	155.86107
and with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music .	204.54594
compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent fifth symphony	84.83734
or the love for three oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , the stone flower .	60.866074
this masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people earthy , salty and humorous .	71.99372
of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .	89.49831
the early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience	488.8083
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .	103.27476
however , in all of prokofieff ' s music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature ' ' -- his craftsman ' s attitude .	88.43758
prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .	63.27344
in orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .	109.71938
his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .	19.924616
his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .	24.759127
his counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .	139.69324
also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required .	59.03335
that prokofieff ' s harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original ' ' than we prefer to believe .	89.39254
need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .	58.363068
prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .	75.823715
at this date , it seems probable that the name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history , as an effective traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose	50.995148
yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics .	110.027596
certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the western world -- not his experimentations .	57.63341
so prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them .	100.99883
nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .	67.449524
his fellow-countryman , igor stravinsky , certainly did not .	28.384014
why did prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? ?	90.52842
i think the answer is to be found in prokofieff ' s own words `` the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	62.194443
when prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose ' ' , he shaped his talents to his purpose .	33.65237
when stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures .	90.33736
prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas .	68.7824
but stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting .	279.0012
in all his miscalculations , stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments .	106.604485
because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant petruchka , his savage sacre du printemps , his incisive les noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .	53.427567
but time is running out , and many of stravinsky ' s admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma .	30.740494
his various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself supra-expressionism , neo-paganism , neo-classicism , neo-romanticism , neo-jazz , neo-ecclesiasticism , neo-popularism , and most recently , post-serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ! !	69.94487
what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! !	1.1172924
meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist	129.6746
a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem ( the star-spangled banner )	46.25035
a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto	19.449722
his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular american commercial songs ! !	121.16681
stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home .	114.1767
prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .	89.74241
in the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose .	131.51385
with a large and circumspect 20th-century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children ' s fairy tales -- slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large .	79.13179
of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him	74.25057
it must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose .	131.68655
thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced one of the great composers of the twentieth century .	18.251814
that his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it .	100.726906
that he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture	63.673203
and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-century evidence of the effectiveness of evolution , based on a broad traditionalism for the creative art of music .	60.596813
april 10 marked a memorable date in new york ' s musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states .	47.03919
on that date the musicians emergency fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary .	84.87521
roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell cotman .	51.336987
and like this english master , mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them .	138.81436
as a boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods .	118.28331
his father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature .	83.297424
out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that roy first painted subjects he knew best hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape .	122.973015
it is this subject matter that has brought mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors .	122.777855
mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .	225.28333
like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures .	131.21457
but it did teach roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia .	54.20325
on the death of their father , they returned to their home in batavia , new york .	18.934023
after more years of concentrated effort , roy and his brother max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .	88.41577
during all this time roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods .	88.503006
gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions .	57.36119
but even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! !	180.60751
except for a rich friendship with the painter , chauncey ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- roy developed his art by himself .	115.69015
in the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint .	74.822975
he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium .	105.15366
gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique .	139.4865
it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of batavia .	26.617178
more often than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .	142.16751
what i have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form	195.83841
color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition	75.54665
and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the mason stylemark .	32.202938
finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .	48.40546
but for the technical fact , we have the artist ' s own testimony	31.312029
`` of late years , i find that i like best to work out-of-doors .	137.08968
first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately af inches ) in which i pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns .	130.27672
if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , i try to place them in the initial sketch .	58.348183
for me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose .	96.07886
`` i am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him	184.62215
as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .	60.40013
just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition .	72.373856
if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result .	110.90156
out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which i call clicking .	95.08352
`` speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .	114.48041
`` if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , i mean to project equal concern for color .	99.37114
often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .	97.79196
when this occurs , i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field .	54.994495
`` when working from one of my sketches i square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal .	268.455
when this linear draft is completed , i dust it down to a faint image .	53.471325
from this point , i paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage .	137.7865
however , first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines i have described .	99.7946
then i plan my attack the parts i will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .	98.477394
the longer i work , the more i am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important .	43.76598
trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .	174.46182
`` as for materials , i use the best available .	24.69266
i work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain .	84.15325
in my studio i work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes .	95.67941
i have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an english make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight .	110.93007
after selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water .	138.67397
then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .	88.41637
`` in addition to the usual tools , i make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes .	78.64492
the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist .	59.913002
i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio .	31.681314
`` my brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for i combine the sable and the bristle .	73.276085
and a very large , flat wash brush .	4.7898192
the bristles are a fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge .	47.05059
`` my usual palette consists of top-quality colors alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , french ultramarine blue , winsor green , hooker ' s green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , payne ' s gray , charcoal gray , davy ' s gray , and ivory black ' ' .	14.899875
in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here .	146.13104
true , a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory .	59.95041
unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist ' s pictures are full of atmosphere and climate .	151.73451
long observation has taught mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights	149.511
and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky .	21.022625
in following this general principle , mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .	66.38725
when painting , mason ' s physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind ' s eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .	123.325645
he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject	230.55167
rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .	93.25702
it is for this reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .	208.9694
his pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale	33.822178
they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people .	30.140629
by dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , roy mason has found a particular niche in american landscape art .	73.78167
living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all .	93.28304
the artist was born in gilbert mills , new york , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to california , he lived in western new york , in batavia .	43.21322
when i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march 15th , i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist the water sign of pisces ( february 18 thru march 20 ) .	101.11163
and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again , in his natal month of march ! !	115.31965
over the years , beginning in 1929 , mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals	134.93417
the blair purchase prize for watercolor , art institute of chicago	104.7486
and others in buffalo , new york , chautauqua , new haven , rochester , rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the laguna beach art association ,	58.49817
he was elected to the national academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first ranger fund purchase prize at the academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to academicianship in 1940 .	91.8975
other memberships include the american watercolor society , philadelphia water color club , allied artists of america , audubon artists , baltimore watercolor society .	170.69254
the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts in the 1960 olympics for one reason -- they were better .	70.58585
they were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers .	118.47462
our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance .	102.64135
the russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .	39.79206
after all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics competition .	80.59697
but if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ?	30.056889
it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .	153.3473
taking first things first , let ' s understand the sport called gymnastics .	291.09933
it is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work .	39.621223
the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in american gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games .	139.68079
the parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .	50.519684
but the russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance .	176.79648
the gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .	52.06468
in short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well .	29.431023
the addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .	167.22368
another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .	64.93254
( an enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days .	51.921753
most europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries .	38.36498
) in most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him .	77.76449
the american is very lucky if he has three .	200.1788
if a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools .	94.76509
first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .	181.00092
oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty .	108.65788
certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .	137.99533
russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800 , 000 competing for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team .	80.686676
eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .	71.430565
we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .	170.18298
and what has dancing to do with all this ? ?	23.672144
russia ' s young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .	177.35114
well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic contest .	59.372818
american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons .	5.817055
they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .	96.82369
they were further stripped of old wive ' s tales by seeing the slender , lovely russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle .	125.78447
president kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation .	107.54187
if we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it .	49.60438
to be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance .	130.25902
if the dance teachers of america make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead .	165.77563
school teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators .	120.30629
there should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it .	67.7535
they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .	174.80598
dance teachers can respond to president kennedy ' s request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .	107.82243
very little in today ' s living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility .	176.22104
they often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength .	77.96454
ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing .	86.67759
even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas .	56.885147
this isn ' t surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in america cannot chin themselves once , and that english school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) .	150.6131
the only area in which american boys hold their own is the baseball throw .	106.88305
for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended .	85.99138
it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .	82.29715
those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it .	153.14941
those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down .	85.95272
when they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up .	58.621063
parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .	51.98621
arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick .	110.01381
keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm .	77.31047
after this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher .	87.29699
follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .	69.79128
push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first .	59.45427
start on the knees in a large circle .	5.6193233
fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor .	29.115286
do this exercise six times each class period .	6.654124
as strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward .	140.28406
start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out .	40.880596
try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands .	59.158524
the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .	141.61824
let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down .	58.998146
five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .	104.35445
handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength .	69.6567
of course those who have developed more will find them easier .	83.55644
start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle .	46.18647
at first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help .	104.03935
drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .	64.70243
the right will land first , followed by the left .	60.968323
care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible .	77.37176
this will prevent flat falls and toe injuries .	1.8982219
bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .	35.498997
eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg .	129.84724
the child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles .	102.47429
be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time .	74.66216
the backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results .	95.74815
have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent .	26.821701
place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders .	52.274696
arch the back upwards to make a bridge .	5.527161
be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling .	80.382805
as flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher .	101.89475
later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .	23.566338
to further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle .	80.37418
place the hands in front of the chest .	2.240089
keep the legs straight and the toes pointed .	8.499749
straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back .	115.09491
at the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head .	67.37501
improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .	17.162909
the last essential to the beginner ' s gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll .	150.90279
this used to be part of every child ' s bag of tricks , but few children can do it today	74.93248
some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .	259.43384
for most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can .	121.62335
after it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) .	99.00359
he places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest .	33.40692
he then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over .	104.55931
one or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo .	147.90196
if , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed .	42.398987
when the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis	104.494316
then no matter what happens , the child ' s performance will be controlled .	28.328133
by lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded .	71.9998
these are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) .	65.665245
even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity .	69.46806
it is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative .	63.85542
and dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .	93.28896
every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics .	79.13847
we have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry .	108.440025
the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .	215.90547
when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .	48.855286
the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities .	89.31256
the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .	150.5664
we use the term `` bio-medicine ' ' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .	46.00486
electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine .	34.546127
recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis .	24.091356
commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices .	84.01492
in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow ' s commonplace equipment originates .	127.67461
from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research .	54.106438
many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .	74.547935
this stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside .	296.13486
a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv system to view the results .	75.46025
fig . 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical electronics center of rockefeller institute .	37.430927
by combining the talents of a medical man , dr . aterman , a biophysicist , mr . berkely , and an electronics expert , dr . zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .	52.508343
three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources .	37.32181
these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror	43.095177
instead of the observer ' s eye the image orthicon in the tv camera does the `` looking ' ' .	57.37445
the microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .	101.59468
the video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen .	85.83083
( note because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor .	56.950905
this assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry .	26.72542
) this is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-tv system which preceded the present simultaneous system .	38.44432
three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube .	9.778891
the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths .	127.02848
many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum .	44.33809
different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .	49.777138
where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail .	138.3368
at the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .	66.52695
the medical title of `` lobar ventilation in man ' ' by drs . c . j . martin and a . c . young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .	50.222874
at the university of washington medical school , the electronics group has developed the `` respiratory gas analyzer ' ' shown in fig . 3 .	31.004911
this unit , affectionately dubbed `` the monster ' ' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient ' s breathing .	44.98108
in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other .	28.376118
usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position .	88.77964
from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .	137.44653
the original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today ' s techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat .	43.115185
for many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed .	66.18714
a group of researchers at the university of washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques .	168.75967
one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched .	108.68524
a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .	104.003044
sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .	53.26013
the travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second	73.19643
thus it takes about 16 msec . to traverse 25 mm . of tissue .	162.44742
a sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation .	36.653324
in addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .	126.30147
the doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .	39.070133
a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself .	33.356613
it uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream .	34.3386
the latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .	22.325377
it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart ' s left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself .	34.880943
this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made .	33.541084
a simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in fig . 2 .	13.533791
outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder .	38.748936
from this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .	159.33792
several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .	148.92073
this original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm . in diameter .	16.775078
battery life limited the use of this `` pill ' ' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .	45.061104
a refinement of this technique has been described by drs . zworykin and farrar and mr . berkely of the medical electronics center of the rockefeller institute .	19.717228
in this novel arrangement the `` pill ' ' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer .	46.74075
as shown in fig . 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc . bursts .	105.542915
the energy received by the `` pill ' ' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring ' ' on after the burst and this `` ringing ' ' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill ' ' .	42.34736
these frequencies are amplified and detected by the fm receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill ' ' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .	90.40535
one of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill ' ' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .	49.21289
applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .	98.85948
one of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body .	29.856272
our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects .	275.10208
various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water .	95.69406
in medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar .	66.28167
because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels .	91.61913
bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .	26.903896
based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through ' ' human organs .	74.16767
a good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by dr . g . baum who has explored the human eye .	66.4257
he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .	279.2099
the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in fig . 6 .	17.534718
the transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown .	130.18178
for display , dr . baum uses a portion of an af , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record .	40.914417
a typical `` sonogram ' ' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in fig . 5 .	32.603523
the frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc . and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter .	37.988632
the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into ' ' all corners .	65.43292
the total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period .	117.27136
drs . howry and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results .	100.85119
by submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in fig . 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights .	50.90192
as mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in fig . 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .	53.267582
arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls .	89.69202
a cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in fig . 8 with the various parts labeled .	35.968395
oersted ' s boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life .	138.08907
he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august 14 , 1777 .	40.39253
his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school .	111.05635
the two older boys , hans and anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german	145.12796
his wife taught the two boys to read and write danish .	130.46733
other brothers later joined them for instruction with oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to bible reading , german , and danish in the informal curriculum .	67.261925
oldenburg ' s contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town ' s learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .	73.36062
from the town surveyor , hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects .	139.77673
the mayor of the town taught them english and french .	16.952002
whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed on to each other	53.998524
they read every book that they could borrow in the village .	42.117146
at 12 , hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science .	47.979088
his earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .	58.0902
in 1793 the brothers decided to enter the university of copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session .	70.85053
while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law .	50.801857
the brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt .	98.01595
they supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could .	59.461185
so impressive were those serious years of study at the university that hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination	74.49876
there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .	100.78888
i lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error ' ' .	108.91939
he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science .	59.01787
in this third year at the university , hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` limits of poetry and prose ' ' .	51.009956
he completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine .	85.84699
he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .	193.55553
hans ' student days were at a time when europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america and in france , germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the continent .	82.298645
the new century opened with oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .	73.00075
he was stirred by the announcement of volta ' s discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis .	61.897022
the following year he devoted to the customary `` wanderjahr ' ' , traveling in germany , france , and the netherlands , meeting the philosophers schelling , fichte , and tieck .	22.218958
he also met count rumford ( born benjamin thompson in woburn , mass . ) who was then serving the elector of bavaria , and the physicist ritter	42.83274
these were oersted ' s main contacts in science .	54.618355
from gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` the first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .	68.11937
as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes i have invented , i have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in copenhagen i used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me ' ' .	98.11981
oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left .	125.158714
with ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host ' s fertile but disorganized mind .	84.73069
oersted remodeled ritter ' s notes into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france for its annual prize of 3 , 000 francs .	51.076866
the sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him .	80.279
in may , 1803 , ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy .	156.00285
he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries .	62.381176
thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` leiden ' ' jar by kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile .	28.907833
ritter proceeded , `` you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon .	63.92171
ritter died in 1810 and oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .	94.648315
in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for the university ' s chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist .	74.1544
however , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in german and danish periodicals .	57.365593
in 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .	80.83872
during oersted ' s attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences .	66.6797
he was , however , fortunate in his contact with prof . j . g . l . manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` lion pharmacy ' ' in copenhagen where oersted assisted him .	35.79016
manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted ' s disposal during and after his graduation .	60.497524
in 1800 , manthey went abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy .	23.07959
in february 1801 , oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead .	70.16012
in the following year , 1803 , oersted , simultaneously with davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts .	56.28303
eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing ' ' .	58.7026
he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .	189.59436
the university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .	83.79456
his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him .	83.112854
his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .	131.5264
the years 1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again , but on this visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .	75.17151
in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in german and this was issued in french translation ( paris , 1813 ) under the title recherches sur l ' identite des forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .	50.455177
his interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated .	89.04402
chapter 8 , is entitled `` on magnetism ' ' and in it are included such remarks as , `` one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces .	37.64804
the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison .	116.21591
it is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication	403.70032
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference .	84.71385
the form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .	35.553394
there , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism .	90.45649
but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it .	96.0773
one could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do .	230.00209
it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by bruckmann and coulomb .	32.020683
by that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces .	43.472107
an attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such ' ' .	91.858765
oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions .	93.96613
in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship .	101.20063
he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .	73.60699
in 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm , one of the danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition .	61.538017
it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , lauritz esmarch , that oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow .	92.003334
together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents .	56.355247
esmarch was among those who witnessed oersted ' s first demonstration of his discovery .	51.497284
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades .	59.285007
electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles .	72.16075
in the late 1700 ' s beccaria and van marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .	75.268456
beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic .	79.6008
the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .	35.69039
the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces .	72.073204
oersted ' s own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .	122.325195
the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of oersted ' s discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 .	71.99162
at this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .	113.69697

there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle ( 1 ) fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons	54.625492
( 2 ) mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface	120.484375
( 3 ) special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides .	83.31732
several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk .	32.21966
the selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference .	131.59723
no one material is best for all situations .	3.557537
selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem .	76.29894
animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk .	57.054222
these bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence .	76.2099
because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal .	71.220856
filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations .	147.21573
all-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year .	339.6874
this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .	130.88712
marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs . .	96.6238
companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged r & d facilities , faster new product development .	101.15287
many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .	172.04582
given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	60.89487
based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .	188.2811
there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years	18.937195
frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers .	28.432768
despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer .	226.19925
here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target	109.695366
has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ?	114.206154
have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? ?	98.42801
have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? ?	162.49437
average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions .	60.921272
this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses .	65.06358
have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? ?	16.877304
need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties .	29.365768
first , most products tend to become more complex .	12.678018
second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around .	296.13968
providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product .	122.025925
too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .	104.5844
good service starts with product design and planning many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one .	104.28814
proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations .	60.44476
have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ?	154.7306
in spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions .	79.59344
to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important .	86.03169
your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .	132.79706
many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer ' s dollar being spent on their particular products .	71.50496
has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying ' ' area ? ?	48.953606
the trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the southwest and far west , and from city to suburbs .	119.680855
these shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs . .	3.1276748
have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? ?	72.36626
we have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends .	117.57125
instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts .	113.13814
the change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .	59.48396
have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? ?	133.85704
in the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .	37.98248
as mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer ' s as well as the distributor ' s profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .	42.182217
average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .	142.85364
moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on .	99.04208
if you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? ?	73.31621
if private brand competition hasn ' t been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ?	118.28038
display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .	20.327682
it has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .	31.984653
how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? ?	84.25074
if you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ?	128.49013
salesmanship is still necessary , but it ' s a different brand of salesmanship .	17.269735
have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ?	557.44336
have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? ?	66.70862
are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? ?	110.78962
some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes .	44.346325
no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .	85.53715
the use of bulk handling is continuously growing .	6.870426
computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .	185.82977
`` selective selling ' ' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .	91.97781
there may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .	44.66279
do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ?	101.991295
in your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ?	64.16556
will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ?	92.88508
in one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos . .	323.29028
as a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .	99.465805
distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .	98.64955
from the manufacturer ' s point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .	30.895018
it is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition .	32.475697
how much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ?	48.208496
are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? ?	155.29259
have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ?	54.48717
practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon .	20.2808
will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? ?	97.48984
if competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store .	205.06003
on the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive .	220.44379
as markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger .	106.5185
is your r & d or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? ?	67.2373
are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with r & d people ? ?	62.463505
technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it ' s useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register .	120.53282
are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization	224.06001
who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs	23.569273
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ?	262.50885
we have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn ' t make up its mind .	102.82833
in the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .	57.74413
while many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training .	166.38351
nor has the training been enough in relation to the need .	20.022682
most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements .	126.89675
have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ?	22.635067
has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	56.050644
with the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future .	99.70994
men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work .	177.57732
the growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .	40.057682
does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ?	85.676834
does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ?	85.44233
every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning .	85.65612
`` hip-pocket ' ' tactics are going to be harder to apply .	72.80583
many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis .	26.917908
with greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can ' t switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically .	135.99924
are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ?	36.59681
we find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning .	236.2777
are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ?	99.090645
do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr . ) marketing program ? ?	34.397007
the key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company ' s marketing problems realistically .	83.01827
solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .	105.19724
if companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade .	164.37617
the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion .	122.73588
the architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building .	46.30651
ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education .	198.64412
it is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .	123.68123
the element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure .	106.43027
this would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer ' s training .	80.80762
we may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject .	110.2783
the real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ?	167.47968
the american institute of interior designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course .	147.393
an examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the national association of schools of art , and a further `` on the spot ' ' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .	59.127335
one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .	97.03958
the suggested course of the a . i . d . was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .	95.88842
obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .	128.36949
without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer .	50.59643
to begin with , what is an interior designer ? ?	4.5609307
`` the dictionary of occupational titles ' ' published by the u . s . department of labor describes him as follows `` designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television .	70.92953
makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes .	37.513203
makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project ' ' .	54.308495
in addition to this the u . s . civil service bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them .	173.53348
he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings ' ' .	34.64433
the interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .	106.33571
yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it .	131.9116
and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .	51.112877
few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum .	72.51406
it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .	96.84355
the old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .	37.03553
as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment ' '	167.91428
no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment ' ' .	85.22959
working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .	151.51929
it is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel ' ' of real interior design demands .	146.50026
unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .	202.96684
it is like medical schools in india where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon .	107.1106
instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .	58.281445
thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .	69.21608
in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .	49.032673
but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .	163.66212
consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .	130.2576
fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade ' ' .	83.6875
even the `` history of furniture ' ' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .	93.65046
here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .	90.36195
the professional organizations such as american institute of interior designers , national society of interior designers , home fashions league and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .	111.21273
certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .	33.439514
not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .	60.921703
participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .	50.43858
the largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .	80.877815
this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .	66.27175
the professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .	81.92668
this seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .	99.98093
in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to the schools .	47.88631
that is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses ' ' in their membership requirements .	29.514874
when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .	116.53199
long hard years of `` on the job ' ' training had brought them to their competence .	54.305916
the necessity of that day has long disappeared .	7.539619
there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .	87.649025
it is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .	38.642094
the reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses ' ' has long since passed .	37.567467
no one can deny that these `` back door ' ' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .	102.95639
beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .	109.10553
it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students .	87.89106
the local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .	147.46205
nor will the hack , the jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .	128.52243
only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .	32.1777
at the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art ' ' .	73.42634
this kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .	92.799065
we must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .	158.57663
considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .	73.49956
in all `` degree ' ' courses in interior design a number of `` academic ' ' or `` general studies ' ' courses are included .	34.254707
it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in english , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .	109.16792
the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .	236.9176
the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .	106.55214
one technical question of school organization comes to mind here .	208.4845
for proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate .	77.40814
since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .	277.5412
indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all .	75.82061
the question , however , cannot be ignored for long .	141.99725
the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .	104.514946
most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers .	107.57669
one solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .	73.66369
it is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .	123.75214
this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .	84.5018
only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .	235.16649
it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department .	178.99689
this , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design .	79.556366
in spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .	67.48668
there will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` national association of schools of art ' ' .	139.87866
independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .	65.90616

consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program .	83.35746
too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant .	163.75464
but even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider .	70.52351
in what section of the country are you located ? ?	117.368256
are you in a rural or urban area ? ?	5.097373
these factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .	76.47043
above all , don ' t set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will .	360.5324
unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time .	162.59778
some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere .	218.59262
if you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they ' re entitled to .	43.86322
this can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command .	151.8743
hallmark cards , inc . , kansas city , mo . , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` benefit bafflers ' ' , which it distributes to employees .	33.905804
m & r dietetic laboratories , inc . , columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe .	107.96448
u . s . rubber company , new york , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits .	77.71381
the blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs $227 . 72 .	24.445774
have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically .	84.99668
you may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .	86.03891
check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .	68.36811
it can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .	150.73157
also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field .	32.62411
this will mean that every time there ' s an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner .	112.84321
don ' t go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .	431.7317
generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .	224.97223
in granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker ' s relation to the deceased must be to qualify .	119.203
thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin ' s funeral .	72.47079
also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you ' ll probably never use it .	47.929714
coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .	223.24873
vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .	200.09242
if coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group .	127.748604
consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .	3.2928462
make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .	57.905598
otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers .	87.96606
keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .	52.30398
and so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .	89.8008
make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan .	301.09448
younger men usually don ' t think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they ' re liable to change jobs several times before settling down .	154.304
choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans .	10.033803
there are two sides of a coin for this decision .	54.699333
workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .	192.33777
and they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .	118.341255
a non-contributory plan usually won ' t pay off for the worker until he retires .	100.17382
thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .	16.393284
make sure you don ' t pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .	137.78697
these include leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .	5.915743
consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant .	71.45686
it ' s usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .	124.03547
for example , the friday after thanksgiving can be substituted for washington ' s birthday .	67.01072
this reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .	14.606732
require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .	101.31448
consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .	8.244985
latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .	39.74021
if a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price .	131.41219
if the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won ' t blame the concessionaire .	57.337917
check your cafeteria location to make sure it ' s convenient for most employees .	50.072258
you may save valuable production minutes with a change .	60.187893
spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .	80.28505
this will cut the expense of vacation replacements .	4.3238983
and with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .	348.62695
also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation .	198.68636
you might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year .	72.33321
the long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .	46.71944
modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .	5.563553
the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .	40.63948
but with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .	184.24742
as the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports .	22.025028
sporting firearms change , markedly for the better .	21.879004
just as modern transportation has outmoded the early studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today ' s sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment .	60.55239
the american firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms .	73.77593
and millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today ' s hunting and target shooting .	81.173035
and due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water .	85.0884
present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .	72.18109
unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year .	46.88313
close to two million game birds were harvested on 1 , 500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on state game commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season .	76.756
the shooting development program of the sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers ' institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers .	114.93033
the most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves .	181.51187
this has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the new york staff of the sportsmen ' s service bureau , and the saami shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .	43.918774
following the kick-off of saami ' s shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in washington , d . c . .	30.618128
the group known as the american association for health , , physical education , and recreation ( a division of the national education association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the national rifle association , saami and the american fishing tackle manufacturers .	50.730934
this meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the outdoor education project .	179.00499
the outdoor education project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .	123.10679
the various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development .	55.308
but with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average american man or woman .	112.09878
following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by oep director dr . julian smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs .	83.238106
saami ' s financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .	32.241756
personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to outdoor education .	89.438965
considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .	200.60995
in 1959 saami ' s shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .	119.629906
this program is now nationally known as `` teen hunter clubs ' ' .	26.91757
teen hunter clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the allied merchandising corporation .	18.256153
the first program was sponsored by abraham & strauss , hempstead , new york , under the direction of special events director jennings dennis .	49.55959
other pilot programs were conducted by a & s , babylon , new york	19.503027
other thc activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-tv stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .	70.26997
saami ' s field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 teen hunter club activities which have reached over 40 , 000 enthusiastic young americans .	115.18808
through the efforts of saami ' s shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few .	78.3956
the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .	93.94754
while individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .	78.200226
help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .	32.94338
the american gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .	130.60608
since saami ' s conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the shooting development program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .	58.94042
we trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .	105.07797
are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? ?	34.620426
are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? ?	65.951996
is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ?	44.962727
would you like to organize teen hunters clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ? ?	106.070755
we were camping a few weeks ago on cape hatteras campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on north carolina ' s famed outer banks .	42.527912
this beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .	266.2903
with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which americans are camping now .	112.82335
there were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , pop tents , baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .	39.227837
moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .	21.200254
we saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long national seashore recreation area .	90.16284
dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers .	109.06813
here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .	106.56723
almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .	139.73941
you read various guesses on how many americans are camping .	21.778412
the number depends on who is talking at the moment .	8.215071
the figures range as high as 15 million families .	7.4541163
i ' ve heard 10 million mentioned often , but i ' m more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping .	47.332573
seven million families would total 30 million americans or more .	29.583641
consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .	115.70217
harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .	43.54586
they are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .	108.245834
the national parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .	57.857822
the national park service hopes by 1966 to have 30 , 000 campsites available for 100 , 000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present .	103.52212
the u . s . forest service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 national forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .	77.7216
they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .	19.325516
they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .	110.49317
they come prepared for family fun because americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance .	116.8506
there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .	82.90343
among them , according to the u . s . department of commerce , are ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .	58.653046
the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn .	78.30642
camping is family fun , and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .	131.86821
but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .	210.31534
here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .	51.441437
the american automobile association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 .	202.71913
the aaa then splits it down this way $10 . 50 for meals , $9 . 50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous .	81.583664
what does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ?	144.57767
the $9 . 50 for lodging they save .	38.085655
because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10 . 50 food bill along with most of the tip money .	184.22098
the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can ' t either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .	92.395676
where americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .	82.75449
long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .	56.826965
and even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .	74.47773
it would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they ' re buying the comforts of home .	76.14005
home is the place to find the comforts of home .	27.17554
they ' re buying fun and adventure and family experiences .	116.26402
but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .	203.63573
this is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .	38.07507
today ' s campers want comforts , and they have them .	57.554615
and this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .	50.02145
it ' s fun , and it ' s easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families .	101.53982
neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags .	14.541726
neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .	95.96009
but there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .	101.967316
throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad .	138.1654
since the industrial revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed .	91.67201
there have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn ' t like it	46.085934
the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work	2301.3452
and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions .	192.40262
there have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public ' s dissatisfaction and loss .	80.79626
this has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .	134.8901
the remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash ' ' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates .	122.1575
but the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer .	49.112885
some men have no talent for or interest in management	545.28424
forcing them into management can only create trouble .	10.318202
the old shop adage still holds `` a good mechanic is usually a bad boss ' ' .	44.902958
yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success .	203.12671
labor fights to change its collar from blue to white .	33.54474
all grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .	46.762432
as several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world .	29.665956
what can be done for the `` individual contributor ' ' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ?	45.38987
he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside	174.43704
usually concerned about america ' s belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles .	222.52051
yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title .	187.81357
even the college professor in america has been affected .	87.8069
it is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills .	76.38515
this difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .	95.00634
this leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people ' ' .	37.124172
nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .	103.476166
so we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up ' ' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions .	62.19157
in the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page .	51.214676
among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of general electric .	31.878641
there is no one point in a man ' s career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward .	97.87182
further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path .	96.65154
it is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions .	106.330696
actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services ' ' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities .	143.52611
also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man ' s recognition as a technical expert .	36.609566
as examples at ge glen b . warren , formerly manager of the turbine division , widely recognized as a turbine designer .	40.216335
the late w . r . g . baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the electronics division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant .	47.913837
harold e . strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period vp & gm of the measurements & industrial products division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the switchgear & control division .	86.02365
in the ge plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers .	62.58252
westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist .	78.119194
many companies have systems , particularly in r & d , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations .	94.51865
another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach ' ' .	151.57753
one company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels .	108.0928
there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks	32.8664
the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision .	108.12975
the second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision .	29.898643
the expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level .	95.47101
the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels .	192.82446
in this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere .	214.47899
this reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military .	56.522232
`` we have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer .	67.69788
we have set up a central r & d department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants .	76.33017
a separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs .	185.301
part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management .	206.9487
these headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design	71.639626
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions .	43.93156
they must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product .	92.94103
`` we do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject .	150.34401
i suppose it is because we are just not big enough .	75.384186
we have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems .	476.1615
the only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by asme , aiee or aiche .	22.605734
i am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability ' ' .	105.93085
`` we have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either .	195.63997
one way to formalize this is in the job structure .	483.75156
we have these positions , which compare directly af	3072.992
`` above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of engrg , r & aj .	37.386208
the latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side .	96.71115
we have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but i believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president ' ' .	61.79475
approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons .	67.075516
the highest position is known as a ' research scientist .	31.025145
the primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society .	161.25412
scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it .	47.859535
we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important	112.558334
and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' dual-ladder ' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions .	100.22895
`` a serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level .	81.48324
with no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance .	102.08501
promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .	169.76598
if no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel ' ' .	56.91488
`` we have two approaches for the technical man the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager	174.69624
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work .	173.56949
these are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige ' ' .	143.36449
`` we have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan .	102.53046
the highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer .	161.40213
the salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) .	47.82414
we also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer .	127.79411
above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder .	287.3205
`` we also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence .	88.57199
these include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers .	207.39966
we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers .	114.92299
publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies .	106.63641
`` a recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for engineering .	50.14528
this function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff .	59.170063
salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management .	60.717308
additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit .	104.7504
`` we presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center .	51.65932
operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status .	41.951553
all scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member .	179.35239
the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community ' s acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field .	74.31596
contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly .	120.482086
`` these recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence .	37.217632
it is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .	177.66862
fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions ' ' .	73.34366
sixty miles north of new york city where the wooded hills of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there is a new home development called `` oakwood heights ' ' .	34.845154
as a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14 , 000 range .	108.92806
but oakwood heights is unique in one particular .	22.897173
its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point .	155.62097
this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state pipeline corporation , with principal offices in new york state .	38.5347
its president is otis m . waters , partner in the law firm of timen & waters , 540-k chrysler bldg . , new york city .	55.60631
vice-president is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter .	244.89175
ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft distributors , inc . , newburgh , n . y . .	14.653535
the idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .	185.28792
not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u . s . and canada , even overseas , write to fueloil & oil heat to inquire if it ' s feasible and where it is being done .	49.587536
its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in new haven described by john schulz in the march , 1950 issue .	62.73403
this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .	46.01141
rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .	34.33997
common complaints included `` mrs . murphy ' ' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` aunt minnie ' ' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .	74.98434
as a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution .	246.94785
a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at oakwood heights .	70.467476
called a `` slo-flo ' ' meter it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles , a key individual being don nelson .	174.06795
tri-state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .	422.56882
there ' s an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed by a lawyer .	144.51233
the earlier new haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .	119.746216
these have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others .	183.01245
in working out the practical legal conclusions president waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .	149.86996
it is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .	92.54793
to overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .	92.46826
when a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to tri-state .	49.81809
for the central storage , tri-state buys one acre , buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece .	230.90327
in other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to tri-state .	69.887596
how does tri-state get its revenue from this plan ? ?	42.62568
it leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position .	53.465103
this first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years .	62.12719
the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties .	123.38594
on this first venture the central storage is 20 , 000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes .	57.245907
the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .	217.39061
however , that is not all he has to do .	31.37398
he must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .	167.7135
in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups .	68.9659
again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best .	261.02975
for this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor .	95.51942
the major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .	184.48532
the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected .	87.67778
for example , the officials of poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .	178.07617
the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets .	78.29514
the public service commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations .	41.429436
several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out .	40.184475
they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies .	214.47243
the government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .	77.624596
there must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity .	74.71228
for a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' x-tru-coat , a product of republic steel corp . , and all lines are welded .	36.72892
they are laid a minimum of 24 ' ' ' ' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking .	65.90233
the meter is mounted high on the basement wall .	9.989765
its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons .	203.97598
it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .	38.956432
ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters .	99.7563
he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .	275.9433
it would be pretty difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhoods , and that ' s an understatement .	50.50366
the job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .	69.97443
but in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .	129.0273
what does tri-state actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for ' ' stage ? ?	101.672516
it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company .	106.47544
it may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .	128.1578
this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully .	72.133545
but it ' s too early yet to go visit oakwood heights .	126.682304
only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor ' s visit on june 8th	34.661068
the big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .	69.77205
a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit .	152.39326
the oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .	25.227348
a primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and tri-state pipeline corporation deserves a very good mark .	77.87997
every year about this time national gargle your cooling system week rolls around .	398.53104
it pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .	88.21936
first , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer .	78.85452
don ' t save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent ' ' type .	53.578266
the word means it won ' t boil away easily , nothing else .	31.289911
the rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don ' t want to risk the rust that two years ' use could mean .	66.588326
if a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner .	93.58484
then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .	13.248808
of course , you ' ll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .	72.249825
now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings .	42.095444
next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again .	70.83495
be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .	12.17453
check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .	56.73307
if you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` dowguard ' ' be sure to check it .	61.1059
dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .	65.381676
check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .	43.037605
take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer .	82.98289
don ' t let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .	168.47995
spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .	215.90846
the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators .	102.606995
if you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat .	44.18518
the thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant .	97.66991
are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?	8.559004
there ' s a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .	161.4176
be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money .	103.89469
first go over the type of coverage you now have .	55.403603
look for these features which may mean you can save	125.73344
for example , don ' t pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy .	184.35095
does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ?	1.040997
this means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .	69.257576
this applies to repair work of winter storage .	2.616081
with many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .	67.1165
usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .	26.888075
for example if your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made .	114.065575
in the period since the end of world war 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field .	104.59616
the importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone .	64.88657
designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries .	72.03661
many of today ' s developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays	193.63362
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers	37.663662
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc . , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics .	37.687984
there is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .	49.41625
the concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p . 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved .	98.59289
according to a recent wall street journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales .	174.21176
five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing .	45.026653
and it ' s far from the end for plastics .	186.9952
industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960 ' s will be of plastic construction .	77.85625
evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , calif . .	32.98804
four years ago , the company ' s entire line was devoted to neon signs	105.45378
from the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive .	74.27664
aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million .	4.7225933
currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components .	52.755695
what accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ?	129.26735
out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important 1 .	250.75397
plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication .	30.246254
according to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit .	98.888565
a 3-by-6-ft . plastic sign weighs about 120 lb . , compared to 275-300 lb . for neon .	28.693363
the weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping .	91.75528
the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed .	28.941715
finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs .	67.99216
they offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer .	80.21961
vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics .	20.890694
pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry .	80.62922
internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night	541.2968
during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest .	135.17741
advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs .	165.74608
among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .	80.825226
for outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture .	126.968895
at present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total .	67.30947
( see panel , p . 166 , for a comparison .	79.11908
of interest is a recent announcement by du pont ' s polychemicals dept . of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as monocite h 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry .	35.56128
sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow .	71.24399
its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to du pont .	16.767448
cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties .	105.01045
its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors .	34.62784
new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color .	21.204245
thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign .	79.850945
( see mpl , mar . 1961 , p . 98 ) .	14.945719
for specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc . , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used .	55.94808
a relative newcomer in outdoor signs is mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) .	36.135765
for outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited .	55.442028
here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene .	10.915533
the final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit .	90.91859
often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques .	42.952194
one of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , and industrial electric inc . , new orleans , la . .	39.22431
the essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within .	139.08395
with the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light .	86.60385
also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign .	105.51313
the copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process .	93.75926
the film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required .	88.47069
spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another	138.12674
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip .	25.674063
panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .	152.792
signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way .	32.979206
it is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use .	63.476818
trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions .	1.7916723
as used by industrial electric inc . , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters .	79.03996
thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces	356.3698
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .	107.245575
in this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media .	220.30812
recently industrial electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign .	128.83058
comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit .	83.63181
the triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec . of viewing time for each poster subject .	175.82066
sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft . wide , make up the 25-ft . length of the sign .	94.71667
perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs .	64.086975
signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters .	92.6866
frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc . .	99.95624
the huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them .	75.40781
here are some of the newer items currently available	45.51265
poster products inc . , chicago , ill . a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock .	136.03879
the background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely .	73.319664
the adaptaplex co . , beaverton , ore . letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black .	95.248474
ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel .	46.577946
for large letters , e . g . thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques .	53.33777
for example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in . and six 36-in . red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background .	82.15757
the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb . each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters .	110.82454
stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .	20.052916
for mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels .	37.55107
large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .	11.145167
wagner sign service inc . , chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches .	58.376007
they are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of tenite butyrate .	18.324808
also available from this company are snug-grip plasti-bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material .	50.68433
made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft . , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters .	66.720894
still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by merritt products , azusa , calif . .	34.9642
this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in . ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0 . 080-in . clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side .	93.51712
finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0 . 025-in . aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces .	104.03608
the sheets are extruded of tenite butyrate by jet specialties co . , los angeles , calif . .	16.060574
on large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e . g . right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate .	31.99106
joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft . high and of unlimited width .	99.59841
letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways .	72.27164
don ' t build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out	117.60607
don ' t insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit	79.36889
position your components before you close them in .	962.3077
don ' t wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances .	30.214865
it ' s a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place .	63.240894
set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom .	22.44648
don ' t try to wrestle a 400-lb . tub af through a narrow doorway .	84.110245
finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) .	65.37064
finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .	82.62922
there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished af closet .	107.33408
don ' t position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction	182.94693
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window .	179.98775
you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side .	56.135643
install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling .	58.824738
don ' t close in your house until everything has been carried in .	137.04778
last wall bob schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage .	37.326527
that way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .	60.77315
no auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block .	62.912186
and trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out .	141.28694
new rule no . 3 rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you	219.19771
this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because 1 .	126.795074
it makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside .	100.981064
it makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 .	56.166862
it changes the answers to `` who should do what , and where ' ' ? ?	18.751133
it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper .	108.272675
it changes the answers on when to do what at the site .	43.442413
for example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .	160.40497
instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) .	140.6023
not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct ' ' and short-cutting the dealer .	92.57225
but now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc . .	73.85654
says clarence thompson `` we dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself ' ' .	54.522545
the revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .	253.00423
the revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done	119.945885
five years ago a house & home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealers ' research council reported unhappily	68.5632
`` only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads	19.069557
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads	111.8346
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads	125.958466
only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads .	18.113943
`` so from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing ' ' .	39.947163
`` that house & home round table was the real starting point for today ' s revolution in materials handling ' ' , says clarence thompson , long chairman of the lumber dealers ' research council .	41.7276
`` it made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .	53.41921
before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem ' ' .	15.530437
almost all of the 3 , 000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year ' s new houses are mechanized .	49.171303
there are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it .	199.46886
practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles .	36.144936
truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .	85.656204
for some significant new items see the pictures .	29.753668
an nlrda survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling .	77.84103
of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost .	133.02458
most of the others will swallow their $ . 50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer .	92.47964
`` with a 15 , 500-lb . fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $ . 30/mbf compared with $1 . 65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time ' ' , says james wright of aj .	88.54079
lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48 ' ' ' ' wide by a nominal 30 ' ' ' ' high ( or six mccracken packets 24 ' ' ' ' wide by nominal 7 ' ' ' ' high ) .	27.45832
these units make it easy to load as much as 48 , 000 bd/ft ( say 120 , 000 lb in a 50 ' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars .	49.795254
the railroads have responded by adding 20 , 000 more box cars with doors 12 ' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars .	139.2126
first was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40 , 000 lb	31.762783
later came a 1961 cut on the west coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $ . 07/cwt on 70 , 000 lb-plus carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70 , 000 lb .	58.291477
more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and nlrda studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type 6-b floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $ . 054/mbf .	65.49673
for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper .	166.79898
this costs from $ . 75 to $2 . 30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .	53.745197
these carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder	59.627087
says nrlda ' s james wright `` since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer ' s other equipment ' ' .	124.86269
the reason today ' s components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper .	34.91155
so manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier .	110.30607
it cuts the lumber dealer ' s cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading .	91.47076
and it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder ' s high-priced labor to help unload it .	65.21075
says wright `` our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years .	57.426376
and most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles ' ' .	70.182274
restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for	180.37325
half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip .	112.92249
even `` america ' s most efficient builder ' ' , bob schmitt of berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2 , 000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works .	93.9105
already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion .	123.57636
builder eddie carr of washington , past president of nahb , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` scr masonry process ' ' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the structural clay products research foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less .	77.819725
a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43 . 50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7 . 50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages .	75.98185
the scr process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day .	130.51375
one good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew .	56.58164
reports jim lendrum `` by studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .	55.248955
we found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don ' t make two teams	70.74395
we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number ' ' .	68.27891
no house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled .	136.83307
don ' t waste any $ . 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $ . 03 a stud	90.82101
this is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit .	202.17497
green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum .	77.670616
but now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels , green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford .	152.57707
dry studs cost less than $ . 03 more .	109.20041
so if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds , the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud .	42.674877
there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone .	119.227
not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance .	94.515854
if you ' ve travelled in europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you ' ve had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic .	97.52554
following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new .	118.40972
however , after you ' ve seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of europe , you ' ll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places .	51.42671
the champagne at troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour d ' argent .	55.137627
you can relive history and follow , in fancy , the crusaders in their quest for the holy grail as they sail out from brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of italy ' s boot .	63.574177
and you don ' t meet the folks from home in northwest spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the middle ages .	93.53577
time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea .	78.266846
they ' ve been there since the days of the moors and the saracens .	19.65651
and what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman ' s village on the mediterranean ? ?	118.134674
an almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road .	59.347485
for those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .	158.11415
then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car .	198.63455
the answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one .	77.84555
almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you .	17.101278
you can call one of the car rental services directly ( hertz , avis , auto-europe nationalcar rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well .	91.44002
with few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost .	117.21333
you can wait , of course , until you arrive in europe before renting your car .	58.815403
the disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all .	70.582085
since charges are relatively the same , reserving a car before you leave for europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it .	146.31267
for those who plan to travel to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home .	109.68736
at some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries .	78.83983
international touring documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data .	356.0861
a valid american driving license is accepted in all countries except portugal , spain , yugoslavia and eastern europe .	30.295467
if you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your international driving permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3 . 00 .	80.58206
your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , theft , liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries .	95.2155
if you would feel happier with full collision insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance .	98.57864
the average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1 . 00 a day .	22.44802
the charge is variable , however , and goes as low as $ . 50 a day in ireland and as high as $2 . 00 a day in greece .	62.938976
rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of europe .	22.697134
there are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available .	146.08478
as in the united states , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week .	44.024094
it drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days .	9.5729885
it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $ . 80 to $ . 90 for the equivalent of a united states gallon and while you might prefer a familiar ford , chevrolet or even a cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller european makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon .	110.22369
your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group .	27.823898
with the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation .	174.74098
there is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn ' t all that much greater than for the wee sedans .	71.97553
the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages .	69.58095
there is the free intra-city `` rent it here , leave it there ' ' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or your hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services .	82.80561
a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits .	90.816895
the investigation will be well worth your time .	14.898763
all model cars are not available in all countries .	14.132054
quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country .	75.88586
if you would like to start your tour in italy , where the rental fees are actually the lowest in europe , fiats in all sizes are available , as are alfa romeo giulietta models .	67.78097
if you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only $1 . 26 a day plus $ . 03 a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station wagon , seating six , at just $1 . 10 a day and $ . 105 a kilometer .	78.78781
if you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn ' t all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $ . 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $ . 30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon .	59.06069
with six in the group , the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee .	117.36383
in the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3 . 00 to $3 . 50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7 . 00 and $8 . 00 a day for the larger , luxury european models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $ . 03 and going up as high as $ . 12 .	64.476746
the same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven .	133.8106
rates for american cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8 . 00 a day up to $14 . 00 a day for a chevrolet convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models .	33.79744
rates in greece and finland are fairly high , actually the highest in europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in ireland .	88.97331
if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to lease a car .	58.588615
the actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car .	47.961666
you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout europe .	147.67694
further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip .	100.178444
there is a fairly wide selection of models of english , german and french manufacture from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 , citroen 2 cv , volkswagens , renaults to the 6-passenger simca beaulieu .	34.00548
leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory .	66.91643
after the first month , rates are considerably less , averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models .	82.0395
there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan .	50.033413
for one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road .	90.347084
then , too , european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them .	95.970436
still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car .	99.20363
the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car .	3.8699021
it isn ' t as expensive as most people believe it to be .	56.33265
your chauffeur ' s expenses will average between $7 . 00 to $12 . 00 a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800 .	24.37391
the big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed .	85.28741
since most european cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than american cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large american cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .	99.018845
the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars .	45.426563
however , whether you arrange to have a european or american model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10 . 00 per day per passenger .	79.104065
this will include your helpful , english-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day .	70.19536
if you drive greater distances than that , you ' ll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands .	65.411644
of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you ' ll have a memorable tour , but it won ' t be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you ' ve had a winner in the irish sweepstakes .	74.38251
in american romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute ' ' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn ' t take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom .	67.261475
just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` i wish they were emeralds ' ' .	65.45399
aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on .	53.43624
the way macarthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this af primary stresses on emeralds and wish	159.97675
note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness .	60.941376
conclusions the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .	149.74045
and the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .	78.55939
in other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of english words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white .	76.56806
at this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture	37.764603
but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if macarthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo .	56.070183
to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .	126.21965
the point -- quite simply -- is this words they might have had	112.45973
this basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by dr . henry lee smith , jr . , at the university of buffalo , where he heads the world ' s first department of anthropology and linguistics .	38.019455
a brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , smith began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named arthur , who never could make up his mind ' ' .	76.70891
later , he became one of the central spirits of the army language program and the language school of washington ' s foreign service institute .	92.401924
it was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock ' ' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication ' ' .	70.62572
to the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history , socio-economic identity , education .	155.5553
it is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .	102.46193
this , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy .	46.151005
in the early 1950 ' s , smith , together with his distinguished colleague , george trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of birdwhistell ( ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone ' ' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking ' ' with one ' s hands , et cetera .	66.91097
smith ' s first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone .	54.596703
for example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother .	79.91864
the usual u . s . norm would be af middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end .	115.759735
the symbols of mother ' s status , here , are all usual for culture u . s . a . .	76.34866
quite other feelings are evidenced by this style af note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence	161.77676
this is a `` fade ' ' ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother .	136.9424
even less regard for mom and mom ' s apple pie goes with af in other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated .	111.09194
and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired .	94.71744
an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .	128.40707
with this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture .	81.69238
the joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .	70.42884
since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions in new research and training .	57.500607
some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940 ' s demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts .	134.86382
in a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words .	104.4084
at a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists .	103.65381
newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .	190.49059
by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist .	43.73629
linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient ' s voice departs from expected norms .	110.02299
it flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences .	97.3795
interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient ' s vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist .	121.35398
his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient .	266.69263
in one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , the first five minutes ) goes like this the therapist ' s level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you ' ' , which would imply disapproval	80.98197
or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people .	62.212093
the patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral	290.96738
aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed ' ' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i . e . , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before .	74.94813
then she catapults into `` everything and everybody ' ' , putting particular violence on `` everybody ' ' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient ' s general style of speech up to this point .	43.50714
consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention .	84.55597
he may then very well conclude that `` everybody ' ' is probably not the true target of her resentment .	61.93812
immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` i don ' t feel like talking right now ' ' .	26.392563
within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody ' ' truthfully refers to the woman ' s husband .	32.880833
she says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` i keep thinking of a divorce but that ' s another emotional death ' ' .	59.889412
the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence	206.58133
so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .	122.759346
by saying `` another emotional death ' ' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .	55.575058
this the therapist may pursue in later questioning .	68.566605
the phrase , `` emotional death ' ' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative ' ' .	80.52978
since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience .	78.77143
his own communication apparatus operated superbly , and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of dr . blauberman .	66.13597
interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques	209.19691
almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .	149.36949
yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what ' s wrong with him	76.769394
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .	161.30827
naturally , the patient does not say , `` i hate my father ' ' , or `` sibling rivalry is what bugs me ' ' .	24.015665
what he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .	292.85538
some of the classic indicators , as described by drs . pittenger , hockett , and danehy in the first five minutes , are these ambiguity of pronouns	34.28444
stammering or repetition of i , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .	206.68912
on the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean i or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person .	117.94803
the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used	52.08904
therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives .	18.255991
when someone says , for example , `` they took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me ' ' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made .	54.536766
( this patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty .	47.14285
) amateur linguists note here that pursewarden , in durrell ' s alexandria quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship .	60.151543
she was just another freighter from the states , and she seemed as commonplace as her name .	60.101254
she was the john harvey , one of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the u . s . fifteenth air force , to field marshal montgomery ' s eighth army then racing up the calf of the boot of italy in that early december of 1943 .	77.64629
the john harvey arrived in bari , a port on the adriatic , on november 28th , making for porto nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city ' s new and modern harbor .	49.00787
hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole .	85.73654
if anyone thought of the john harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried .	84.926865
it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront .	35.41046
for in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons .	42.840492
throughout the early years of world war 2 , , reports persisted that the axis powers had used gas -- germany in russia , japan in china again .	142.1341
influential people in america were warning the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns .	134.08325
some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first .	349.84198
to silence extremists , to warn the axis , president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august	108.79362
`` from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare .	58.55851
i have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons .	168.72942
`` however , evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources .	73.06674
`` use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .	43.060833
this country has not used them , and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them .	31.592264
i state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies ' ' .	43.73186
the following month the invasion of italy was begun , and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern italy .	107.1338
bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields .	56.594482
it would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below .	114.156715
so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey .	20.733187
a detachment of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under first lt . howard d . beckstrom went aboard , followed by lt . thomas h . richardson , the cargo security officer .	73.662254
only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks .	234.14336
thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at bari .	140.4718
it was the night of december 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in bari .	55.616997
it was getting on toward 7 o ' clock and the german me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit .	93.796555
capt . a . b . jenks of the office of harbor defense was very worried .	166.48454
he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in italy .	74.967575
on november 24th , they had made a raid on la maddalena .	44.411926
two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the me-210 had made its first appearance .	77.77936
after it had reappeared the next two nights , jenks went to higher headquarters and said	161.8991
`` for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures .	89.95479
they ' re just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic ' ' .	66.17238
but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist .	81.34961
even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general peltz , the commander who would conduct the `` little blitz ' ' on london in 1944 , a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously .	45.358944
true , there had been raids on naples -- but naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast .	143.81659
more than that , allied air had complete superiority in the eighth army ' s sector .	43.088703
so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him .	113.70065
for jenks knew that bari ' s defenses were made of paper .	40.6202
the royal air force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available .	194.23999
there were no r . a . f . fighter squadrons on bari airfield .	51.889366
the radar station with the best location was still not serviceable .	57.284355
and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command .	272.35718
it had been made shockingly evident that very morning to ensign kay k . vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the john bascom .	68.7831
a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped .	110.25359
then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers .	78.42454
`` this harbor is a bomber ' s paradise ' ' , the britisher had said with frank grimness .	51.55721
`` it ' s up to you to protect yourselves .	149.60892
we can ' t expect any help from the fighters at foggia , either .	87.44781
they ' re all being used on offensive missions ' ' .	7.5323887
not fire until the bombs came down ! !	1.1153216
he thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head .	23.752638
like hell he ' d wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ?	373.37103
what would his guns guide on then -- the north star ? ?	115.10194
ensign vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put seaman 2/c donald l . norton and seaman 1/c william a . rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette .	62.046665
below decks , seaman 1/c stanley bishop had begun to write a letter home .	30.244478
above decks on the john harvey , lieutenant richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy .	55.49133
there were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible .	75.99456
bari was asking for it , he thought .	55.817375
for five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold .	102.19322
he hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth .	107.81076
the burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men .	53.676907
lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs .	53.678123
they seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as bari .	161.47542
nine of them had gone down the gangplank already .	863.46796
deck cadet james l . cahill and seaman walter brooks had been the first to leave .	60.177277
richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer ' s stock in trade .	33.096626
the other half of the crew , plus beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard .	56.34826
damned if that wasn ' t a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- porto vecchio .	53.410675
the night was so clear that richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette .	148.33392
then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward .	82.712395
it was a clear night and it was raining ! !	47.775
capt . michael a . musmanno , military governor of the sorrentine peninsula , had also seen and felt the `` rain ' ' .	47.692913
captain musmanno ' s renovated schooner with the flamboyant name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the sorrentine ' s civilian population .	37.44653
at exactly 7 30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face .	101.94807
he turned the beam of his flashlight on it .	23.299152
it was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating .	128.54167
another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth .	8.288671
it was `` window ' ' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers .	110.0857
unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at bari .	52.080482
they had come from airports in the balkans , these hundred-odd junkers 88 ' s .	23.613363
they had winged over the adriatic , they had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill .	208.47287
they had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares .	192.36436
and they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane ' s spotlight to guide on .	65.93395
after the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until british mp ' s shot it out .	84.16032
in that interval , the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor .	62.23218
merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss .	124.36896
captain musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft .	55.92458
they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under .	120.33722
ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets .	27.307219
most of the junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs .	34.175026
vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire .	45.625164
norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors .	35.78033
bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one , three and five .	184.52289
luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt .	82.38676
the order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks .	68.828735
there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement .	83.58138
you explain , `` i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before .	133.62523
i can ' t tell when , but i ' m positive i witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past ' ' ! !	41.645206
this experience will have happened to many of you .	67.66785
emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when ' ' .	136.74123
most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .	98.281456
in this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually .	59.75762
when a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .	58.834335
occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .	90.639084
one day maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified .	89.11475
rudyard kipling ' s scorn for the `` jargon ' ' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life film ' ' ? ?	66.54852
the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself .	100.66602
one day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` i want a word with you , please ' ' .	59.759785
at that moment kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier .	155.19531
freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .	70.354225
however , readers who accept freud ' s findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his interpretation of dreams , chapter 1	98.97206
as `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams ' ' .	76.05042
dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .	9.858696
the basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .	87.62738
i recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town .	60.02762
i am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures i have seen .	109.03095
and when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it ' ' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .	97.34532
skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .	201.19672
the question becomes , `` what is a dream ' ' ? ?	13.569166
is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? ?	45.834877
every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .	64.96595
in most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects .	97.35939
but these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don ' t remember having seen in real life .	67.02052
for instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and , with photographic realism , sees smith driving the car	302.2369
whereas , it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car .	128.84636
there is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams .	181.37526
the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .	89.9098
a `` mental image ' ' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension .	132.34506
dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .	149.05087
as in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .	24.11789
but then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .	93.83306
the opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative perception , in the book philosophies of science by albert g . ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception ' ' .	65.52403
but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ?	32.635914
as retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location .	81.46898
hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness .	83.59545
modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy .	95.53563
we know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc . , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .	83.13358
so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies .	152.49947
this theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .	174.02945
space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions .	28.729555
if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? ?	197.52617
it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future .	115.60033
three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events .	53.38165
the body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies .	120.439926
the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .	109.834755
consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .	89.32956
when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .	116.74333
if the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life .	65.96668
dr . h . v . hilprecht , professor of assyrian at the university of pennsylvania , dreamed that a babylonian priest , associated with the king kurigalzu , ( 1300 b . c . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .	54.500774
as a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by dr . hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .	77.2836
some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest ' s information .	91.240105
dr . hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .	90.12046
he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite , and imagined it must have been german or english .	75.2212
we may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by dr . hilprecht ' s subconscious reasoning .	67.928444
but , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ?	92.98324
that the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor ' s brain , or 2 .	61.60742
that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met ? ?	86.96544
the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vue feeling .	83.30322
no doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper ' s mind .	70.34273
probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake .	451.90692
when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar .	85.06049
nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists .	80.61472
if deja vue is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people .	94.97871
chauncey depew , one-time runner-up for the republican presidential nomination , was attending a convention at saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met .	46.247417
after the preliminary business affair was finished depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for roosevelt .	110.50249
if depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue .	36.488407
but the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .	57.578938
he remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .	52.621822
one week before the convention , depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .	48.474514
`` the food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here ' ' ! !	16.218721
so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from north country school , lake placid , new york .	87.16077
in this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school .	79.77179
because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .	94.76857
when served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities .	106.14483
situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands .	61.05324
these contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight .	133.72134
from fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-september to june .	67.812614
the director , walter e . clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare .	141.29529
to him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind .	74.36857
the concept of good nutrition really began with the garden .	99.0768
the school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school .	45.371002
in a climate hostile to agriculture , mr . clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques .	61.716183
where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail .	134.57774
throughout the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat .	147.16548
mr . clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil .	93.20821
`` to give up these notions required a revolution in thought ' ' , mr . clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading `` organic gardening ' ' and `` modern nutrition ' ' in a search for help with his problems .	47.183216
`` louis bromfield ' s writings excited me as a conservationist ' ' .	11.804765
by 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray .	54.82292
he locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains .	146.99883
after reading `` plowman ' s folly ' ' by edward h . faulkner , he stopped plowing .	100.61861
the basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds .	58.43349
separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .	93.84908
all these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year .	59.142643
it was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader .	42.329174
years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity .	39.258038
soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this .	156.23564
to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , mr . clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth .	72.66003
sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , `` this soil used to be like that hard packed road over there ' ' .	75.251625
`` people and soils respond slowly ' ' , says walter clark , `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program .	50.944725
no chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used ' ' .	17.808525
the garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar .	19.414679
the carrots sometimes don ' t make it through the winter	156.89133
the cabbage and squash keep until march or april .	121.19045
there is never enough corn , peas or strawberries .	4.911357
mr . clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future .	82.48601
a new project planned is the use of bio-dynamic starter .	8.34952
new ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment .	140.47409
`` after the soil , the kitchen ' ' , says mr . clark .	10.768638
the first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread .	88.523476
`` adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push ' ' .	51.403835
at first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves .	119.07813
`` you can ' t make french toast with whole-wheat bread ' ' , was an early complaint .	62.986023
of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better .	183.58759
mrs . clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering .	43.546806
then miss lillian colman came from vermont to be kitchen manager .	145.92819
today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread .	73.377625
mr . clark ' s studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour .	83.0589
once the grains are ground , vitamin e begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week .	86.48153
a mill stands in a room off the kitchen .	34.73077
surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state .	22.035408
miss colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor .	20.078495
she goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding .	56.21756
the bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma .	27.858795
it is well liked by the children and faculty .	120.87885
`` lillian ' s bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much ' ' , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds .	48.533596
the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at one time that was all they ever served .	78.07947
when the chance came , they first eliminated cold cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day .	116.782364
they serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal .	3.8419409
occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot ' ' .	72.49319
at the beginning of the school year , the new students don ' t eat the cereal right away , but within a short time they are eating it voraciously .	50.80749
when they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal .	58.454613
the school has received letters from parents asking , `` what happened to johnny ? ?	43.331676
he never used to like any hot cereal , now that ' s the only kind he wants .	55.636124
where can we get this cereal he likes so much ' ' ? ?	13.987897
salads are served at least once a day .	4.9956203
most come from the root cellar or from the freezer .	7.2107363
sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey .	26.923782
sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today ' ' ? ?	96.921715
the school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs .	49.37318
lots of cheese made from june grass milk is served .	26.346628
hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .	57.701107
organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week .	103.15359
also , salt water fish is on the table once a week .	49.717754
for deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week .	32.24646
most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at least , sometimes at snack time .	90.981995
dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed .	43.596523
apples come from a farm in vermont where they are not sprayed .	51.403698
oranges and grapefruit are shipped from florida weekly from an organic farm .	77.69729
finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem .	22.054636
following a talk by mr . clark at the new york state natural food associates convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from vermont .	90.073296
wheat-germ , brewer ' s yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves .	32.67584
miss colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables .	44.71591
raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves .	44.29604
very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged .	32.914623
pitchers of water merely appear on the tables .	1.9930253
the source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues .	45.379593
the cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin c content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible .	233.66844
since mr . clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons .	70.89277
to solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains .	37.07601
on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail .	108.708885
they learn to like these so well that it isn ' t surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time .	65.31475
they tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey .	112.91485
maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .	38.186535
this and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking .	58.194996
parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts , but no candy .	122.613914
mr . clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs .	43.86495
the heavy meal comes in the middle of the day .	9.345295
soup is often the important dish at supper .	3.5725205
homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins .	75.29348
the school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality .	71.41265
the cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day .	90.87507
even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , mr . clark felt the school had a good health program .	93.012726
rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule .	53.567596
a vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking .	22.480934
since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof .	203.56662
visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children ' s hair to bring out the sheen .	42.658
the ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment .	330.80038
buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond northfield gulf .	62.803318
wires whined as a cold november blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit .	30.381151
he peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below .	155.00517
`` good old iron compass ' ' ! !	1.130532
a plume of smoke rose from a central vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights .	77.18133
the girders of a shattered dog river bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream .	56.711918
vermont ' s main railroad line was prostrate .	4.848486
and in the dark days after the great flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state ' s history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the united states mails .	68.06258
rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of friday , november 4 , 1927 , when officials of the post office department ' s railway mail service realized that their distribution system for vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight .	60.521275
clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail .	187.22787
the state ' s railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks .	194.92278
and once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood ' s victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems .	102.009285
from burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across lake champlain to the railroad at port kent , n . y . .	18.984274
the nearest undisrupted end of track from boston was at concord , n . h . .	15.113111
when governor al smith offered new york national guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing burlington ' s bottleneck and that at montpelier too .	81.844795
the question was `` where to land ' ' ? ?	3.2189713
there was no such thing as an airport in vermont .	37.433086
burlington aviator john j . burns suggested the parade ground southwest of fort ethan allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned national guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged `` jenny ' ' and dehaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base .	50.864105
the only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged montpelier was on the towne farm off upper main street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions .	119.29125
over in barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone .	96.76231
anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , granite city citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd infantry , vermont national guard , laid out runways on wilson flat , high on millstone hill .	95.47465
the `` barre aviation field ' ' was set to receive its first aircraft the sunday following the flood .	137.10757
though the makeshift airports were ready , the york state guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule .	106.935104
they had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their world war 1 , planes .	87.75391
it seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air .	110.532524
they had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals .	47.473278
down in concord , new hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time robert s . fogg , a native new englander , had been a world war 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the concord airport .	48.106377
tall , wiry , dark-haired bob fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history .	234.45015
piloting a curtiss navy mf flying boat off lake winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original rural delivery air service in america .	71.46634
during the excitement following lindbergh ' s flight to paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes .	96.76794
in concord , bob fogg was the most prominent new hampshire boy with wings .	245.52583
public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map .	146.75847
the ship was a waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225/hp wright radial engine known as the whirlwind .	42.619297
a trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long , the waco was entered to compete in the `` on-to-spokane ' ' air derby of 1927 .	46.753357
as a matter of fact , fogg and his plane didn ' t get beyond pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers .	203.79932
so with all this experience , bob fogg was a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract .	119.35254
his work began just six days after the flood .	101.978935
by airline from concord to burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier .	63.381847
the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back of the state house when the wind was right , and used wilson flat above barre when it wasn ' t .	112.952324
between the unsafe towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory .	167.3431
each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river .	69.900696
`` but fogg ' ' , they countered , `` we can ' t get over there .	20.196753
and besides you seem to make it all right here ' ' .	22.118694
it took a tragedy to bring things to a head .	202.11569
after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field .	80.49722
sent to montpelier by secretary herbert hoover , red cross aide reuben sleight had been killed , and his pilot , lt . franklin wolfe , badly injured .	47.9636
with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside .	207.86371
faced with this situation , postmaster charles f . mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of berlin .	100.14249
a long flat known as the st . john field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the winooski bridges were at last passable , they decided to use it .	85.65833
with a wary eye on the farmer ' s bull , fred somers of montpelier and mr . st . john marked the field with a red table cloth .	75.16484
as a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling .	27.990124
with these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the waco , bob fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21 , 1927 .	83.23294
each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches .	52.360886
during the second week of operations , fogg received a telegram from the post office department , asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one sunday trip ' ' .	75.38896
since fogg ' s was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions .	101.33632
over the weeks , america ' s first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation .	145.68153
each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home .	112.02386
always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer ' s boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them .	75.240036
a sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit .	41.450394
the airman ' s stock answer to `` weren ' t you cold ' ' ? ?	16.625792
became `` yes , the first half hour is tough , but by then i ' m so numb i don ' t notice it ' ' ! !	37.64469
as daylight began to show through the frosty windows , fogg would place a call to william a . shaw at the u . s . weather station at northfield , vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings .	48.339207
shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station .	130.15173
`` ceilings ' ' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions .	390.56232
later on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank e . hartwell .	80.686485
out at the airport each morning , fogg ' s skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar .	39.38308
( he ' d get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover .	40.448753
) wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , bob fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition .	107.13614
concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the whirlwind ' s exhaust overhead .	64.6227
sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed .	192.10632
plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation .	125.32205
often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the winooski or the white river along the line of the broken railroad .	79.84017
when driving rain or mist socked in one valley , fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the ottauquechee up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes .	198.66893
the dependable wright engine was never stopped on these trips .	52.249725
it ticked over smoothly , idling while fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen , and one from montpelier and barre at the st . john field .	43.40546
sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs ' ' high over the clouds .	89.85511
there he ' d take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he ' d be over the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him .	76.444466
bob fogg didn ' t have today ' s advantages of instrument flight and ground control approach systems .	478.27347
at the end of the calculated time he ' d nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable .	133.22638
usually back in concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of mrs . fogg ' s hot broth before starting the second trip .	47.192295
day after day fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .	44.290558
at fort ethan allen the ever-present wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated .	92.03151
once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved the engine and got the tail up .	66.30181
at a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream .	89.204666
tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet .	30.669628
one afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , fogg took off for concord from the st . john field .	23.879011
if so , are you saying , `` where did the last few years go ? ?	64.63198
how did i get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?	73.39431
what do i do now ' ' ? ?	1.0121918
yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly .	104.88294
somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire .	40.303932
we always thought we would die with our boots on .	356.1148
out of the blue comes talk of pension plans .	14.480766
compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon .	1.5668355
still , it seems in the far future .	26.720402
suddenly , one day , up it pops ! !	17.0156
sixty-five years and you ' ve had it ! !	15.959742
you ' ve thought about it before in a hazy sort of way .	56.893333
never seemed as if it could happen to you	210.75896
a great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers .	62.848976
if so , you are of the old school .	115.07636
you are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose ends .	62.994827
also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word .	149.77351
you never are late for work and seldom absent .	112.644455
actually , you can take no special credit for this .	26.094181
it is the way you were taught and your way of life .	39.55622
all this is standard equipment for a man of your day	101.06257
however , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing .	129.05418
your way doesn ' t seem to be so darned important any more .	209.33173
you realize you are getting in the old fogy class .	69.84169
to put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded .	55.47572
now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and i . b . m . machines .	149.1997
this is followed by a boom in conferences .	7.2117343
when a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on .	235.82848
you had your day and it was a good day .	19.273052
well , to get back to the problem of retirement .	35.83268
every retiring person has a different situation facing him .	17.316454
some have plenty of money -- some have very little money .	46.7024
some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids .	76.644844
some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments .	95.67408
some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass .	59.108444
some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything .	112.62121
well , whatever you have , that ' s it ! !	11.620765
you ' ve got to learn to live with it .	16.984634
the question is `` how are you going to live with it ' ' ? ?	9.142089
you can sit back and moan and bewail your lot .	39.43332
but , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged .	75.60684
it seems to me , the first thing you ' ve got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be .	32.255165
make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life .	69.90969
one thing , i am sure of , you must get an interest in life .	54.983093
many of you will say , `` well , what can i do ' ' ? ?	11.367
there are many , many things to do .	12.602567
find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl .	134.99043
if you can ' t think of a thing to do , try something -- anything .	102.57578
i , frankly , can ' t draw a straight line .	91.89732
maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? ?	76.87823
you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it .	28.91425
anyway , i ' ll bet you have a lot of fun .	12.386558
does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?	81.16219
do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? ?	35.12354
there is always a market for this line of work .	30.681198
some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work .	147.76648
where sewing is concerned , i ' m a total loss .	50.169758
when you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and i have to sew them back on , or get out the safety pins .	111.05513
then again , there ' s always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs .	37.04929
not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you .	50.361732
how ' s about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? ?	51.08744
some people love to crack tile and it ' s amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time .	96.65762
do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? ?	22.446993
there is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary .	32.348278
some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood .	25.45256
some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc . .	14.871064
perhaps you couldn ' t do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? ?	30.481583
outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some dandy little gadgets .	76.83487
some women get a real thrill out of housework .	173.99858
they love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball .	105.521935
i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that ' s where it belongs .	233.99133
perhaps you would like to become a writer .	5.4002385
this gives you a wide and varied choice .	13.495298
will it be short stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children ' s stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious ? ?	40.38733
ever since i was a child , i have always had a yen to try my hand at writing .	99.14698
if you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection .	54.570625
just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep on plugging , and finally you will make the grade .	93.81646
few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me .	66.05422
but , it could happen , and it may happen to you .	66.68428
then there ' s always hobbies , collecting stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires ? ?	65.57761
i can hear some of you folks protesting .	37.990143
you say , `` but it costs a lot of money to have a hobby .	23.713217
i haven ' t got that kind of money ' ' .	8.035583
it does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free .	123.14631
how about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? ?	72.537964
also , there ' s scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you .	78.976524
it ' s getting interested in something that counts .	139.04907
as for me , i am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( i love puzzles ) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands .	309.48495
so far , the covers have never been off the boxes .	76.8344
i just don ' t have time to do half the things i want to do now .	67.074684
so in closing , fellow retired members , i advise you to make the most of each day , enjoy each one to the n ' th degree .	76.387146
keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet .	221.22968
to one and all -- good days ahead ! !	23.368887
what does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ?	226.94202
when we turn to noah webster we find him helpful as usual .	142.31639
`` to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power ' ' .	112.139725
we are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .	176.03206
thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a league of nations or , developing a mature character .	111.32436
all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .	104.870834
while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .	56.923214
an animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .	51.05281
man ' s great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .	18.279964
this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .	135.0666
it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .	107.98213
in our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne come into actuality .	45.539536
the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of 1941 .	170.39516
in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man ' s projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .	61.646507
it is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his creator .	28.533274
not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .	96.8938
we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .	82.17249
we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .	39.691296
by this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .	81.96638
we must realize with prof . charles morris in his the open self that `` man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation ' ' .	106.39672
so far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .	99.17965
is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .	134.56715
is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? ?	88.12031
sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity .	108.81707
some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , victorian past	52.298058
that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation .	103.116806
perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance .	67.83632
joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women .	85.8888
various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .	74.05755
privacy must be highly assured both in time and place .	42.427315
that is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment .	72.37423
if the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other ' s arms will be bliss enough for these few hours .	136.29643
the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose .	157.48497
first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .	85.09063
one thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act .	140.5931
ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion .	37.79083
the hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .	106.357765
( hymen , in fact , is the greek word for membrane .	45.129665
often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse .	191.01833
as might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity .	74.922615
it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one	191.5649
so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations .	62.257706
but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs .	63.67557
some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood .	92.56338
more rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration .	35.232723
extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated .	82.28012
these cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds .	112.14828
in recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .	97.734856
obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation .	63.78549
is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? ?	130.20084
gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .	94.08899
if he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it .	89.88481
as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .	51.11518
this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act .	42.65166
the vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation .	11.597739
this is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby .	65.48099
the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .	57.48298
but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .	84.85494
that is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain .	84.12068
the advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .	106.12697
since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .	157.46063
by using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape .	92.02097
in this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .	168.89798
she learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object .	171.14943
apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment .	120.464905
it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation .	141.21883
when no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves .	83.11036
special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .	44.47129
folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints .	222.96544
the long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels .	58.066685
under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .	60.26483
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .	63.246986
but during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain	38.87812
and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .	146.78918
these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .	31.15763
the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind .	141.03592
they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina	24.270235
at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .	74.005264
in fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon .	69.936935
locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration .	87.18463
the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all .	207.04482
ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .	77.06324
the insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen .	58.50799
the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .	119.10625
serious attention must also be given to the husband ' s problems in the honeymoon situation .	60.981987
the necessity for keeping alert to his bride ' s hazards can act as an interference with the man ' s spontaneous desire .	61.433495
the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .	152.26202
this is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife .	134.17892
or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .	110.85767
the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them .	56.509514
the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again .	157.73965
this may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .	77.19163
he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .	138.85912
now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .	217.00389
the accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman .	119.96093
too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment .	31.400253
only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .	102.72493
both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid .	62.793346
if the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older .	87.45853
writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled the nude a study in ideal form , kenneth clark declares `` the human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations .	88.7009
it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves ' ' .	18.91292
perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form .	90.527
the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality .	47.262344
differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds .	30.974215
whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations .	123.92067
such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked ' ' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period ' ' .	86.86373
attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .	127.37415
the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger ' ' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons .	80.816444
the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man ' s spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration ' ' .	70.73349
one is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .	185.90201
i still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism ' ' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit .	98.998405
in tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .	32.029324
the partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy .	101.782684
at its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares .	484.2718
but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .	163.29388
instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .	168.22556
in the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .	73.2452
but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .	20.19976
in a growing number of american homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .	116.2429
it is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act .	51.30094
it is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband .	131.2456
the whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs .	38.20034
beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .	182.76549
but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .	61.164143
of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned ' ' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .	42.717762
yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .	88.33436
the meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother ' s or grandmother ' s standards .	27.469406
to many experts , this trend was inevitable .	5.362336
they consider it simply a sign of our times .	158.74269
our society has `` emancipated ' ' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .	133.40718
it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .	34.913986
`` the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum ' ' , declares dr . mary steichen calderone , medical director of the planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent book , release from sexual tensions .	60.904835
`` it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .	79.19876
a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too ' ' .	58.122753
yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .	75.28486
it can , in fact , wreck a marriage .	74.68998
when a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife ' s desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .	59.01655
and she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .	7.1543345
on the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .	18.270632
he is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well .	158.7495
`` a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband ' s maleness ' ' , declares dr . calderone .	53.169605
this opinion is supported by one of the nation ' s leading psychiatrists , dr . maurice e . linden , director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health .	20.685783
`` when the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous ' ' .	56.26202
in one extreme case , cited by a pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker ' s wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .	63.125656
to win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .	136.517
caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .	31.599106
while he was in custody his wife divorced him .	34.220085
more typical is the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage counselor .	97.27572
this woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired ' ' for marital relations .	15.098599
to please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .	26.527008
finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .	59.834034
one wife , described by a new york psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood card parties .	205.58118
after every money argument , she rebuffed her husband ' s overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .	31.690742
experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .	178.27353
the wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .	69.68933
she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .	47.208817
the husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is `` don ' t rock the boat ' ' .	91.2999
sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .	29.576103
hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .	87.85808
more often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .	137.08392
some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .	133.45758
the wife ' s attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .	61.014297
naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .	84.76836
unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .	62.857006
generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife ' s mercy .	50.07703
`` the pattern ' ' , says dr . morton schillinger , psychologist at new york ' s lincoln institute for psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night ' ' .	73.48295
no one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .	62.40995
after all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as dr . schillinger points out .	81.12509
there is no evidence that these milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .	72.33062
furthermore , dr . calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around .	106.516426
they aren ' t `` frigid ' ' and they aren ' t homosexual	19.86598
they ' re just restrained in all of life .	31.278938
one such man once confided to dr . theodor reik , new york psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .	33.771606
asked why , he replied primly `` because that ' s no activity for a gentleman ' ' .	32.443295
but such cases were , in the past , unusual .	272.36133
society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the bible appears to endorse the concept .	99.58193
family survival on our own western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man ' s strength and ability to bring home the bacon	78.52976
and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .	70.77712
this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring life with father manner .	54.29262
in those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere .	120.42241
`` grandma wasn ' t expected to like it ' ' , dr . marion hilliard , the late toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the ' 90s .	27.287474
wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used ' ' by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were .	118.81649
when did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?	12.454463
some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .	151.06161
virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .	118.90809
left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .	122.49734
circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance .	165.08304
she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .	70.48972
she liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .	38.384327
`` very few wives ' ' , says dr . calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .	59.954617
a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well ' ' .	51.036076
and an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .	107.746925
marriage manuals and women ' s magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .	50.126965
they began to describe in detail the woman ' s capacity for response .	25.817574
in fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , dr . albert ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior ' ' to men .	25.329483
according to dr . ellis , the average 20-year-old american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .	86.96947
not surprisingly , dr . ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .	147.52435
yet , paradoxically , according to dr . maurice linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .	82.79933
an aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .	239.74527
`` when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife ' s aggressiveness ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .	30.829103
often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction ' ' .	1.3448248
one such wife , dr . linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .	70.944405
but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .	117.189804
then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .	17.358435
in some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .	97.90701
thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .	131.81717
if his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .	93.888336
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .	96.466034
on the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .	148.83873
or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .	133.34473
in any case , dr . calderone remarks , such problems are a couple ' s own affair , and can ' t always be measured by a general yardstick .	53.12095
`` as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates ' ' , dr . calderone declares .	59.08153
`` the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment ' ' .	39.66736
other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .	111.13141
and just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .	162.35675
`` to get a marriage back where it belongs ' ' , comments dr . schillinger of the lincoln institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .	49.136616
he must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .	69.34058
he must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' ' ' .	87.31369
too many husbands , dr . schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they ' re doing ' ' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play .	82.54609
she gave herself a title , lady diana harrington .	9.298321
the new york d . a . gave her another , the golden girl of cafe society .	81.52925
houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute .	55.618088
and houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on september 20 , 1960 , `` diane harris graham , 30 , d . o . a . , circumstances -- unusual ' ' .	86.943756
early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor .	146.27032
she was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world ' s oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour .	64.952515
she never hid the fact that she liked to play .	28.644552
her neighbors in the expensive houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the golden girl of the mickey jelke trial ' ' .	81.67451
it was the trial of oleomargarine heir minot ( mickey ) jelke for compulsory prostitution in new york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl .	78.85701
( jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls .	54.01987
diane was needed as a material witness in the case and new york police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course .	95.39237
she had been moving in cafe society as lady diana harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns .	53.595882
it was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best .	151.29713
clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to assistant district attorney anthony liebler describe her to the arraigning judge	134.463
`` this girl is the golden girl of cafe society .	41.41166
`` in 1951 she was a prostitute in new york county .	53.4421
in the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to france , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all europe with him .	64.493256
`` at deauville she met an egyptian by the name of pulley bey .	10.669233
he was the official procurer for king farouk , now in exile .	22.917845
she was in egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty .	91.96105
`` we have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally back into this country .	47.87083
`` our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to jelke ' ' .	61.066372
i am not a prostitute , and i had only one very wealthy boy friend ' ' , she said .	24.754215
during the course of the trial , jelke backed up part of that statement .	301.61755
`` diane is the type of girl ' ' , jelke said , `` who wouldn ' t get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor ' ' .	45.340855
but she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends ' ' .	26.98367
she came to new york from detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor ' ' instead of a chaperone .	37.361526
as she told it , `` he ' s a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 ' ' .	41.50107
she was mary lou brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive .	34.235992
she had talked her `` boy friend ' ' into sending her to new york to take a screen test .	83.82437
the screen test was never made -- but diane was .	230.16689
she quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business .	249.77946
she seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke .	116.8115
an ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` mr . warfield , the famous producer ' ' .	47.769886
the phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows .	61.855804
`` i ' d love to audition for you ' ' , she gushed .	14.888969
the audition was held a few minutes later in somebody ' s apartment .	61.00761
she thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance .	169.42648
after a few minutes he said , `` i can ' t use you if you dance like that .	55.07207
i ' d like to see you dance nude ' ' .	11.161233
diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again .	230.9307
even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique .	247.90907
when the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` if you go home now , i ' ll scream ' ' .	25.0623
more often than not he would bow to the inevitable .	13.268397
one who needed no such threats was a french financier .	25.69329
one of the blonde ' s yearnings that he satisfied was for travel .	407.46457
she wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a french holiday .	49.439285
in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her .	175.96577
`` then she went to deauville where she met a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers ' ' .	37.157646
the greek evidently fell for her , `` monsieur x ' ' recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100 , 000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables .	57.078384
she could do no wrong at the tables that time .	50.391354
and in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way .	190.90277
smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to paris .	41.744545
no one ever learned what happened to the greek .	969.1982
the luxury of paris ' most fashionable hotel , the george 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to rome .	82.5052
she teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made nero envious .	50.29118
to climax her roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky hotel excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help .	88.25028
it was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night .	27.101469
discreet italian police described it in a manner typically continental .	240.466
`` there had been a threesome at the party in the suite ' s bedroom miss harrington ( this was diane ' s choice for a roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known american actors .	95.42209
`` the actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent .	122.06323
the hotel staff , as well as residents of the excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall .	101.768166
`` they were wearing nothing but their scratches .	7.891068
the girls , after dressing , were indignant .	6.703205
`` you can ' t do this to us ' ' , diane screamed .	26.380903
in the morning she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally luxurious hotel ambassador .	51.107384
with the ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad .	155.96188
of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do .	32.2939
by this time diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world .	67.77389
she thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in rome , she met pulley bey , a personal procurer to king farouk of egypt .	41.14674
a close friend of hers in the roman days described it this way	220.71588
she had a hard time making him understand that it was farouk she wished to meet .	84.84903
`` pulley bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him ' ' , the friend continued .	56.92104
it seemed as though she were always auditioning .	4.315182
no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see farouk .	79.6431
pulley had set her up at the semiramis hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key .	65.56913
she picked her own middle-eastern friends from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzzed around her .	123.9459
tewfik badrawi , mohammed gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of cairo society enjoyed her company .	181.80492
`` so extensive became her circle of admirers ' ' , egyptian police said , `` that her escapades caused distrust ' ' .	31.151134
the roof was about ready to fall in on diane ' s little world , but it took nothing less than the egyptian revolution to bring it down .	56.492165
when farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , pulley bey .	22.417942
they also called upon diane with a request for a look at her passport .	84.53461
the cagey pulley bey , who spoke no english , had taken the passport so that diane couldn ' t leave the country without his approval .	89.6443
officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the united states .	18.312895
and return to the united states she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the new york district attorney ' s office .	46.934944
held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the women ' s house of detention , a terribly overcrowded prison .	40.890068
it is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the district attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at vesuvio ' s , an excellent italian restaurant .	61.268208
newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the district attorney .	32.783672
with the end of the trial diane disappeared from new york .	16.694077
it was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` lady harrington ' ' .	64.63851
several years ago she married a houston business man , robert graham .	107.369095
she later divorced graham , who is believed to have moved to bolivia .	34.084713
houston police got to know diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring .	145.78702
last may , they said , she admitted being a prostitute .	61.443134
the next time the police saw her she was dead .	13.44176
it was september 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles .	20.494888
she had had a party with a regular visitor , dr . william w . mcclellan .	21.489378
mcclellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died .	66.923
he had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time .	71.737595
when he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police .	123.622444
when the police arrived , they found mcclellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently .	108.05378
the blonde ' s nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her .	122.87414
pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls .	33.960644
an autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in diane ' s body .	35.314583
police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her .	178.34563
`` i think that maybe she wanted it this way ' ' , a vice squad cop said .	43.626095
`` a maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date .	174.48079
she was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens .	603.46356
at least she never knew what the bottom was like ' ' .	24.174088
i work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the east .	45.30073
we cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8 , 000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores .	60.276157
i am selling the stuff of which is made one of the great american dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting .	45.031517
there is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream .	381.3374
from where i sit it looks more like a nightmare .	13.855069
they depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little .	148.6894
franklin d . lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs . claire shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in bakersfield , california , several months ago as a prospective patient .	54.053288
`` doctor ' ' lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes .	109.70416
then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .	73.69566
she had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder .	81.21741
( he explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it .	103.07128
) he knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator ' ' machine .	71.48494
as he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of mrs . shaefer ' s body , lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo .	49.99552
yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her .	119.97895
did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people ' s health ? ?	63.459568
the human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light .	174.68425
for that reason , he informed her , the lord made the sky blue .	163.80641
continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her	86.764885
this machine will cure your cancer-ridden body ' ' .	1.7837609
`` you didn ' t tell me i had cancer ' ' .	22.108492
but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about .	100.154045
why , i once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body ' ' .	27.152155
he urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300 .	214.25513
when she said that she didn ' t have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one .	95.62901
he then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again ' ' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away .	90.75724
lee renewed his pressure on mrs . shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .	73.05834
after another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts ' ' .	50.913486
he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine .	134.58421
when she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , mrs . shaefer felt intense pain .	49.785034
leaving lee ' s office , mrs . shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue .	89.52793
for several days , she was ill as a result of lee ' s treatment .	16.709488
mrs . shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some $30 , 000 for his ozone machines .	135.68747
for mrs . shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee -- and her friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection bureau .	129.32425
and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of lee ' s quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend ' s clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting franklin d . lee .	83.68802
the charge violation of the california medical practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs .	63.553295
the sentence 360 days ' confinement in the county jail .	25.5575
rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases .	47.744835
the machine quack makes his rube goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts .	112.88217
with these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people ' s respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age .	87.67164
he milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer .	80.53028
the gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10 , 000 -- anything the traffic will bear .	82.90909
he may call himself a anaprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor ' ' -- or what have you .	33.759933
not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .	95.82913
the medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines .	61.310642
his plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions .	36.776703
according to the food and drug administration ( fda ) , `` doctor ' ' ghadiali , dr . albert abrams and his clique , and dr . wilhelm reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10 , 000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines .	53.8524
authorities believe that many of the doctor frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .	139.6702
look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in cleveland .	26.914316
sarah gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and mr . a . , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast ' ' and the `` diagnometer ' ' .	28.797537
multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .	119.37144
you will come up with a frightening total .	11.912232
that ' s why the fda , the american medical association ( ama ) , and the national better business bureau ( bbb ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually .	46.002678
the postmaster general recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history .	81.66703
similarly , the american cancer society ( acs ) , the arthritis and rheumatism foundation , and the bbb have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high .	63.276066
for example , the bbb has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago .	130.53224
authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer .	165.99133
in this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .	310.03192
the economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .	23.112795
but it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .	77.54802
by preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity .	151.24303
typically , sarah gross and mr . a both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks .	135.64044
sarah gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .	87.10605
as a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor ' ' was using were phony .	99.833725
she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .	23.215036
mr . a . , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis -- and himself .	69.29451
mr . a has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man .	71.11284
`` that ' s a lot of hard-earned money to lose ' ' , he says today .	21.1167
`` neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor ' s treatments ' ' .	21.584734
and there was the case of tom hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine .	82.50863
after his pains got worse , tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .	56.217026
yes , tom caught it in time to stay alive .	172.25038
but he ' s a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor .	93.54852
but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .	57.311756
in such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor fraud ' s cure-all gadget can prove fatal .	70.86252
moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .	104.78442
in chicago , some time ago , mr . h . , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike ' ' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $306 as a cure-all .	60.593086
`` hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have ' ' , said the company .	60.83912
mr . h . is dead today because he followed this advice .	216.87624
doris hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see otis g . carroll , a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in spokane .	47.84604
carroll diagnosed mrs . hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic ' ' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) .	62.463593
his prescription hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .	55.477917
although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water .	101.1356
inevitably , mrs . hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds .	24.904425
moreover , her husband and child contracted t . b . from her .	36.31912
( small wonder a spokane jury awarded the husband $35 , 823 for his wife ' s death .	27.178297
in california , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of h . f . bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer .	58.57655
he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $185 each .	87.399956
when authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify he was dead of cancer .	74.709175
`` unfortunately ' ' , says chief postal inspector david h . stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court ' ' .	86.97216
that ' s where device quackery can lead .	7.783718
the evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands .	74.71677
who are the victims of the device quacks ? ?	11.722412
authorities say that oldsters are a prime target .	3.4232874
says wallace f . jannsen , director of the fda ' s division of public information `` quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer .	51.9743
people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks ' ' .	108.019066
the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like mr . a . , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to doctor fraud ' s avarice .	64.06467
they are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .	3.856462
ten-year-old richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year .	32.42478
his grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school .	129.98409
mr . and mrs . stewart were puzzled and concerned .	69.25111
then one day dick ' s classmate jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag .	68.87384
the youngsters in the boys ' class had nicknamed dick `` bugs bunny ' ' because his teeth protruded .	30.679787
when richard ' s parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested .	74.54591
during the year that followed , dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance .	141.29906
`` the majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment ' ' , says dr . allan g . brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field .	26.11288
what do parents need to know about those `` years of the braces ' ' in order not to waste a child ' s time and their money ? ?	77.59847
how can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ?	42.384945
why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? ?	1.0287672
occlusion is the dentist ' s expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed .	126.986885
malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for .	170.2876
one main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth .	51.529163
a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion .	50.899334
these two basic malformations have , of course , many variations .	44.126823
a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions	92.290344
a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw .	4.4576874
crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth .	59.555737
front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close .	163.20732
upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close .	68.15696
the eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs .	134.74823
second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row .	85.16894
contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition .	68.13401
however , this does not mean that a child ' s teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family .	51.561546
tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it ' s important to remember that there ' s a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits .	28.944757
it ' s perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old .	111.543015
occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster ' s teeth	76.890656
but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect .	67.35931
malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .	140.13635
if a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble .	106.72064
if baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place .	66.965485
every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth .	83.121414
some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed .	69.115
in certain cases , as in dick stewart ' s , a child ' s personality is affected .	27.677996
yet from the dentist ' s point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons .	55.32799
bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots .	82.00121
this serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults .	73.05618
then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay .	101.262276
`` for these and other reasons ' ' , says dr . brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth ' ' .	12.318677
the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system .	102.36592
because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition .	150.93842
badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping .	94.09509
`` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 ' ' , says dr . brodie .	48.56712
in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy .	186.02252
orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw	100.02495
they are not anchored directly to the bone .	3.182165
abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided .	82.959785
what can 10-year-old susan expect when she enters the orthodontist ' s office ? ?	10.175897
on her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and `` tooth prints ' ' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws .	70.09254
if he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs .	137.06613
this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone .	32.632656
as the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved .	111.436584
this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster .	184.90804
`` if teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place ' ' , explains dr . brodie .	92.36871
`` moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child ' s face ' ' .	46.529484
during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear .	112.373055
parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay .	150.23816
when in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered .	40.8136
next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending on the severity of her condition .	74.45547
during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth .	63.725563
susie ' s teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position .	39.303627
but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place .	44.61083
usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth .	38.206688
susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day .	17.414068
then comes the time when the last wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist .	73.388466
straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months .	64.80201
aligning all the teeth may take a year or more .	16.884882
an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct .	81.981346
the charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country .	16.093473
work that might cost $500 to $750 in the south could cost $750 to $1 , 200 in new york city or chicago .	64.256065
an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1 , 000 .	55.01619
`` factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner ' ' , says dr . brodie .	39.97466
to become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist .	88.250496
`` costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher ' ' , says dr . brodie .	30.450775
`` fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago ' ' .	28.190315
people today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field .	39.905136
most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years .	33.56519
in many cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee .	118.84567
some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents .	67.04738
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .	25.510088
dr . brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children ' s births .	115.13267
`` in the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at	160.9596
now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent ' ' , he says .	30.276476
`` fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do ' ' .	22.837517
this knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment .	59.46215
for example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another .	113.67452
in the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy ' s large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them .	127.42008
in other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment .	325.0199
the child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth .	86.29147
`` nature often takes care of the problem ' ' , says dr . brodie .	5.1056833
`` a child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity ' ' .	66.8903
that is why dr . brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist ' s advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early .	94.76844
`` both because of our culture ' s stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so .	85.003044
let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment ' ' , he urges .	54.608692
superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research .	53.64413
plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money .	89.270706
plaster of paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child .	96.22672
as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be .	62.508175
`` after your child ' s baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it ' s time for that first dental appointment ' ' , dr . brodie advises .	56.97693
`` then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year ' ' .	26.713547
to help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things	91.89022
he can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth .	54.71465
if a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed .	122.812164
in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them .	240.92119
from time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him ' ' , who were `` on the other side ' ' , and reports what they are saying .	26.243362
after a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames .	78.57523
as the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements .	97.5984
there are a few prognoses of coming events .	7.5670385
another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading .	96.77564
some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual .	111.00218
not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums ' ' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased .	48.024303
in fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( esp ) , on this side of the `` veil ' ' .	51.250904
however that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons .	107.9407
perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans .	144.56725
they may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship .	88.57364
the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control ' ' who speaks through an entranced sensitive .	125.41345
what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation .	190.36763
but it is not really only a conversation .	15.029828
many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind .	81.56075
he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood	29.30997
it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! !	118.42892
most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious ' ' moods and to clarify them .	51.15605
however , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading .	77.9568
instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing .	86.33448
for this was to be a `` proxy sitting ' ' .	4.2729163
as was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive .	89.38768
dr . karlis osis , director of research at the parapsychology foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` new research on survival after death ' ' , spring 1958 ) .	133.74234
he remarked `` it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter ' ' .	55.698902
the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium ' s esp may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated .	62.017437
one way to do this is by `` proxy sittings ' ' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .	44.886215
if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions .	117.64527
all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions .	151.32779
sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings ' ' are used .	27.964489
here the absent sitter makes a `` date ' ' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to `` come in ' ' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him .	39.614723
in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else .	34.885723
he gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator .	117.73703
as always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter .	31.453615
so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium ' s esp and the absent sitter ' s mind .	21.691986
it is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield esp can range .	204.83476
now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .	34.462227
here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic ' ' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual ' s own case .	79.40167
if you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! !	51.255352
an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit ' ' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ?	71.858215
it is , of course , easy to see how `` j ' ' will mean uncle jack to one person and little jane to another .	140.98045
`` a journey ' ' , `` a little white house ' ' , `` a change of outlook ' ' , can apply to many people .	23.822533
and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one ' s own point of view , which is by nature so personal .	55.876495
one sitter may think `` a leather couch ' ' identifies a reading as surely directed to him	87.33821
to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` atta boy ' ' ! !	56.68337
to get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him .	182.1688
if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame `` does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ?	141.03586
or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience ' ' ? ?	89.325554
conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant	79.56415
`` he had four children , two sets of twins .	24.788784
after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry .	110.05001
part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road .	19.48488
he died of typhoid in 1921 ' ' .	4.129297
methods have been developed of assigning `` weights ' ' to statements	16.558847
that is , it is known empirically that names beginning with r are more common than those beginning with z	408.8304
that in the united states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox .	145.74913
so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights .	122.65222
specific dates would be important , as would double names .	428.74448
various categories have been explored to find out about these `` empirical probabilities ' ' against which to measure the readings .	94.057274
in the parapsychology foundation ' s long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements .	56.023335
it is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself .	128.54573
or , on the other hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? ?	141.32103
that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out .	16.99049
so , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator ' s name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as correct ( hit ) , incorrect ( miss ) , doubtful , or especially significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) .	88.425095
he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his .	287.59506
all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the hits and significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter ' s own reading .	47.550465
that is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .	272.32938
conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material .	69.03172
and there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated .	59.16233
in another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements .	80.75554
does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ?	208.71895
does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? ?	242.39418
it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` hits ' ' .	133.16078
now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream ' ' , where the sensitive is at her best .	131.80157
mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses .	84.59384
`` i feel cold ' ' , the medium says , or `` my leg aches ' ' , `` my head is heavy ' ' .	30.064407
or perhaps she hears words or sounds `` there ' s such a noise of loud machinery ' ' , or `` i hear a child crying ' ' , or `` he says we ' re all here and glad to see you ' ' .	41.023476
maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door ' ' .	59.40669
the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions .	78.41343
sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there .	87.4416
if pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer .	153.7799
if asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them ' ' -- some more vividly than others .	75.20284
perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all .	11.786303
even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another ' s personalities , moods , intentions .	117.3921
of course , there is an element of training here these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power .	134.4569
simply using it increases its intensity , i was told by one sensitive .	136.24646
nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery .	166.07335
impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .	215.62213
it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning .	72.52523
if communication with an entity on the `` other side ' ' is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism .	87.32101
during one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons .	109.46891
but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail	1830.8202
taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement .	34.917305
in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained .	322.26584
though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols a slope to signify the name `` hill ' ' , for instance .	90.17497
one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter .	60.03738
the farmer ' s life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock .	56.45627
livestock must be tended every day , routinely .	162.99585
a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .	32.747505
even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .	88.34742
the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily .	231.88043
he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice	262.51462
such a move may mean a loss of capital .	74.47044
hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life .	19.917166
the farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night .	191.47485
frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .	93.12109
no matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up .	221.5227
it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .	46.625977
drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops .	183.3581
sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner ' s earnings , even into his capital .	59.204185
returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year .	90.37984
the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis .	44.282574
land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .	94.99864
part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .	204.53668
if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high .	67.27052
a part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .	110.23545
it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .	195.76698
he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn .	58.409508
there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job .	130.08919
the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost .	50.29183
this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .	16.848188
if the farm is rented , the rent must be paid .	14.6548395
if it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of .	70.478294
a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children .	19.134327
it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air .	70.512146
the children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .	96.03205
caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work .	67.085785
part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs .	109.81061
for some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income .	61.89351
it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health .	73.841995
generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city .	24.892397
the savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .	203.78552
usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more .	54.870968
where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same .	69.29213
a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .	100.72512
some persons consider the work on a farm recreational .	61.363197
for some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner .	55.14499
part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal .	36.72112
it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation .	47.421967
general requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below .	101.796555
specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .	73.18927
three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs .	50.46628
you could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .	164.67523
if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you ' ll need more land .	64.65765
in deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you ' ll need to bring in the income you expect .	43.84274
but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .	63.529022
the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .	545.7009
some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .	141.76979
sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .	46.98886
when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm .	81.73038
if you have a year-round , full-time job you can ' t expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help .	36.586338
as a rule , part-time farmers hire little help .	137.46724
in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .	81.36101
list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month .	30.25783
you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one .	50.99835
do not include all your spare time or all your family ' s spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work .	63.823063
if you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools .	172.79243
you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however .	55.123325
for larger plantings , you ' ll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .	26.49998
if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) .	93.161736
these tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing .	54.260323
cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer .	46.033344
if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises .	140.61407
you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .	78.135666
if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work .	40.802654
before you look for a farm you ' ll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake	43.66029
and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent .	38.64994
information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture .	93.32482
if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy .	56.015213
discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .	80.35195
choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .	135.51405
then if you change jobs you won ' t necessarily have to sell the farm .	34.82322
the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .	70.89382
obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .	11.602227
if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby .	488.31345
if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city .	75.112274
look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .	5.3168125
there are slums in the country as well as in the city .	14.289969
a tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .	108.61142
check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them .	81.90199
find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality .	25.24521
if these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect .	98.01464
you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .	141.58199
you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water .	12.858648
if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled .	93.78936
a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden .	54.70533
pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble .	44.701286
the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses .	55.937675
is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ?	37.90733
if you can ' t tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist .	255.84221
soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones .	94.38975
small areas that aren ' t right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop .	181.38374
will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? ?	98.66606
how much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? ?	69.30823
if the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements .	71.21451
the value of the farm to you will depend on --	317.65848
the value of the products you can raise on it .	34.37671
the possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision .	101.267105
decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town .	72.635574
take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work .	44.278416
next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm .	16.96471
to do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm .	125.50726
list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year .	48.36957
estimate the value of the produce at normal prices .	8.809002
the total is the probably gross income from farming .	17.806004
to find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming .	50.16909
include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment .	46.183643
also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family .	53.67833
it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it .	166.68661
otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor .	75.36248
to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .	68.07238
everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge .	163.3519
for almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .	38.95451
one who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers .	90.48997
the gruesome humor of the nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david -- nor the gratuitous sadism of ss officers .	124.88306
public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the german press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .	66.6407
and still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .	85.4174
most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant ' s department of jewish affairs .	66.40784
counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .	86.01725
would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client ' s chances ? ?	116.87195
those who feared `` emotionalism ' ' at the trial showed less understanding than dr . servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .	194.80312
interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the attorney general for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow .	86.98104
but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new york .	98.37326
in each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course in moscow the liquidation of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalin ' s dictatorship	34.8049
in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism , with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard .	16.708815
these trials were properly termed `` political cases ' ' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .	64.97032
but what could the eichmann trial initiate ? ?	1.0399717
of what new course could it mark the beginning ? ?	44.483105
the eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future .	60.780693
it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are jews .	78.19403
as such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message ' ' .	58.904118
`` it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial ' ' -- said ben gurion , `` and not the nazi regime alone -- but anti-semitism throughout history ' ' .	100.530365
how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism ? ?	101.394135
and if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove eichmann a `` fiend ' ' ? ?	75.64405
these questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution ' s case .	20.476528
it might be contended , of course , that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism .	68.900314
but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment .	61.906055
in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument .	84.31348
one who could be linked to anti-semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the ages .	140.32425
shout at eichmann though he might , the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism .	131.7331
yes , he believed that the jews were `` enemies of the reich ' ' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic ' ' anti-semites	22.9843
but he believed in the jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .	54.705986
the real question was how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself .	51.1365
in regard to eichmann , it was to be found in the nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent .	89.157295
perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could , as eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer .	239.50098
not through fear of disobeying orders , as eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitler ' s victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` well , let ' s try it ' ' .	73.85647
at any rate , the substance of eichmann ' s testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the ss , and though the prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to that extent .	89.47838
but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it .	149.32327
if anti-semitism was on trial in jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of eichmann ' s department of jewish affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of jews by non-police and non-party anti-semites in germany , as well as in poland , czechoslovakia , hungary ? ?	62.969658
the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the german state , including the reich minister of the interior , the state secretary in charge of the four year plan , the reich minister of justice , the under secretary of foreign affairs .	75.972565
the measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .	127.41553
heydrich , in opening the conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by goering which authorized the final solution as `` a complement to ' ' previous `` solutions ' ' for eliminating the jews from german living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .	83.92648
in other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating in every phase of german life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .	129.33658
this , in fact , it turned out to be .	27.0901
since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling german industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of hitler ' s crimes	121.50325
whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .	92.07382
what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?	70.3552
not in eichmann ' s anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning of the trial .	115.77475
no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had conceived their anti-semitism as an `` innocent ' ' dislike of jews , as do others like them today .	159.82135
the final solution proved that the jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .	77.25095
ought not an edifying trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere ' ' anti-semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ?	106.19323
the prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-semitism ' ' among the germans which hitler `` stimulated and transformed ' ' .	41.82245
but if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmann ' s head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .	82.46378
nor did the trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .	118.36558
certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .	100.688866
eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .	65.60428
do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the jews in germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ?	80.06385
the career of eichmann made the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization fearful of being mistaken for a jew , he seeks protection in his nazi uniform	192.7023
clinging to the enemy-jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness	149.89362
once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .	121.854454
`` is this the type of citizen you desire ' ' ? ?	32.061737
but though this characterization in no way diminished eichmann ' s guilt , the prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it .	72.99692
finally , if the mission of the trial was to convict anti-semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the final solution was aided by native jew-haters -- i . e . , germany , poland , hungary , czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- denmark , holland , italy , bulgaria , france ? ?	51.52279
should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports ? ?	81.31645
wasn ' t this meaning of eichmann ' s experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ?	101.65409
as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage , the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .	79.40099
only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin .	146.10387
it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe .	78.94922
it is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable	407.84244
most of the information elicited in jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .	105.49437
in poughkeepsie , n . y . , , in 1952 , a roman catholic hospital presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff .	57.432785
three agreed , but four declined and were suspended .	128.57661
after a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 .	23.101196
the peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy .	112.73436
in new york city in 1958 , the city ' s commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a contraceptive device .	54.461628
he thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving protestants , jews and roman catholics that continued for two months , until the city ' s board of hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .	73.817314
a year later in albany , n . y . , a roman catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood association .	39.882652
immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man ' s right to freedom of religious belief and conscience .	46.557438
these incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .	91.15739
it has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies .	266.03204
it has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .	73.63097
where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .	38.132397
the time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .	36.016243
the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .	102.845
instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .	56.059357
`` all too frequently ' ' , points out james o ' gara , managing editor of commonweal , `` catholics run roughshod over protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades ' ' .	78.493034
all too often our language is unduly harsh .	3.2740724
the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between catholics and non-catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning .	131.09874
instead of catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .	86.90094
family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring .	36.661144
pope pius 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications ' ' .	52.955143
this means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .	49.06785
these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics in family planning .	107.61112
the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons .	105.02553
the roman catholic church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning .	127.95393
catholics , protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used .	82.4895
the roman catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period .	92.0326
the church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author it involves no frustration of nature ' s laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .	120.8766
with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice .	104.6744
there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .	116.48732
the grounds for the church ' s position are scriptural ( old testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .	39.15854
the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .	66.00007
the roman catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end .	52.06402
this conclusion is based on two propositions that man by the use of his reason can ascertain god ' s purpose in the universe and that god makes known his purpose by certain `` given ' ' physical arrangements .	113.23793
thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .	31.849392
moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by god , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception .	83.01823
believing that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature , roman catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .	72.97924
let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable .	20.968868
but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .	75.21485
why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ?	57.049408
it is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others .	118.89362
it is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others .	93.2167
both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .	24.270449
consider what happened during world war 1 , , when the protestant churches united to push the prohibition law through congress .	135.67938
many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .	49.825405
with over four million american men away at war , protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public .	89.904396
with the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .	58.00677
the attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history .	34.72231
the so-called `` noble experiment ' ' came to an inglorious end .	18.904478
that tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .	84.618774
that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today .	109.068184
up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law .	82.22435
this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian countries .	49.9326
today , the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction .	507.7826
the various lambeth conferences , expressing the anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally .	125.43678
in 1920 , the lambeth conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race ' ' .	61.02713
denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the conference declared `` we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage .	100.981926
one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children	41.292778
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control ' ' .	47.064796
the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .	67.6163
in 1930 , the lambeth conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .	63.02643
in 1958 , the conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by god on parents everywhere .	206.93842
many other protestant denominations preceded the anglicans in such action .	94.46016
in march , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified artificial methods of birth control .	44.856422
`` as to the necessity ' ' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .	49.81007
there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right ' ' .	64.43623
since then , many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .	46.4761
what determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive in general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .	99.20633
this development is reflected in the action taken in february , 1961 , by the general board of the national council of churches , the largest protestant organization in the aj .	26.366356
the board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning .	111.07753
it called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives .	102.8503
the general board declared `` most of the protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .	84.54815
the general protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception ' ' .	90.90978
an action once universally condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .	55.027443
this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .	21.595825
repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control .	40.339
for all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american people is clear , profound and far-reaching .	62.218086
to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment .	122.803505
this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .	73.02839
conscience and religion are concerned with private sin the civil law is concerned with public crimes .	92.93616
only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .	95.84992
among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself .	108.400375
on april 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , discovery , weighed anchor in st . katherine ' s pool , london , and floated down the thames toward the sea .	29.915462
she carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic waters of north america .	46.032467
seventeen months later , on september 6 , 1611 , an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery limping eastward outside galway bay .	32.414032
when she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation .	188.02621
the captain was gone , and the mate was gone .	13.571932
the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .	58.426277
what disaster struck the discovery during those seventeen months ? ?	22.975441
what happened to the fourteen missing men ? ?	1.0607259
these questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .	44.076797
for hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain ' s fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man ' s desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports .	57.371666
all told , they offered a highly confused picture .	106.950356
but since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .	86.52451
not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .	35.05433
historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .	33.814873
first , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma .	20.19944
second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on american towns and counties , on a great american river , and on half a million square miles of arctic seas .	74.0797
this is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine	73.52161
the sailing in the spring of 1610 was hudson ' s fourth in four years .	32.417446
each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from western europe to the far east .	106.665596
in 1607 and 1608 , the english muscovy company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole or across the top of russia .	63.52527
twice he had failed , and the muscovy company indicated it would not back him again .	155.29051
in 1609 , the dutch east india company hired hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the half moon , and supplied him with dutch sailors .	109.680305
this time he turned westward , to the middle atlantic coast of north america .	25.454988
his chief discovery was important -- the great north ( later , the hudson ) river -- but it produced no northwest passage .	228.26347
when the half moon put in at dartmouth , england , in the fall of 1609 , word of hudson ' s findings leaked out , and english interest in him revived .	64.01196
the government forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship .	47.18801
he thereupon went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .	259.1114
by springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of henry , prince of wales .	53.451122
he had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .	89.02551
the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .	5.9684224
a century of exploration had established that a great land mass , north and south america , lay between europe and the indies .	91.03011
one by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .	253.19287
in fact , hudson ' s sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes .	186.25027
but there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .	22.723377
nearly twenty-five years before , captain john davis had noted , as he sailed near the arctic circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides ' ' .	64.654915
he named this opening , between baffin island and labrador , the `` furious overfall ' ' .	8.142821
( later , it was to be called hudson strait .	39.511616
in 1602 , george waymouth , in the same little discovery that hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .	162.78156
hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway .	114.05094
even hudson , experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the thames .	130.60432
on previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain .	139.8712
on the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .	65.32929
on the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic .	96.20947
worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .	46.246235
of only one could he be sure -- young john hudson , his second son .	135.54216
the mate , robert juet , who had kept the journal on the half moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity .	107.49337
philip staffe , the ship ' s carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .	48.302986
arnold lodley and michael perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against hudson in a crisis .	180.29776
but men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find .	197.52559
hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .	125.66049
it is believed that hudson was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was trained on company ships .	59.25166
he was a londoner , married , with three sons .	51.743057
( the common misconception that he was dutch and that his first name was hendrik stem from dutch documents of his third voyage .	129.27603
) in 1610 , hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession .	25.476276
hudson ' s first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the thames .	29.970297
there at the river ' s edge waited one henry greene , whom hudson listed as a `` clerk ' ' .	76.64401
greene was in actuality a young ruffian from kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores .	41.669918
he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had greene wait at gravesend , where the discovery picked him up .	76.11511
for the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of great britain , then turned westward .	45.127426
poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` lousie bay ' ' .	48.211346
the subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .	39.514256
with hudson looking on , his protege greene picked a fight with the ship ' s surgeon , edward wilson .	52.709507
the issue was settled on shore , greene winning and wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england .	226.18373
with difficulty , hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from iceland .	17.210453
early in june , the discovery passed `` desolation ' ' ( southern greenland ) and in mid-june entered the `` furious overfall ' ' .	21.915066
floating ice bore down from the north and west .	44.11229
turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet .	5.1268177
the ship ' s compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north pole .	82.70779
as the bergs grew larger , hudson was forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay , an inlet of the great strait .	82.124626
after finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled .	75.82625
the trouble was at least partly juet ' s doing .	29.51014
for weeks he had been saying that hudson ' s idea of sailing through to java was absurd .	64.09095
the great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason .	241.05899
a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther .	89.251854
instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( sir francis drake lopped a man ' s head off under similar circumstances ) , hudson decided to be reasonable .	67.56435
he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew .	58.355637
patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives .	120.29259
when hudson had finished , the `` town meeting ' ' broke down into a general , wordy argument .	43.644165
one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in england .	50.21184
up spoke carpenter staffe , who said he wouldn ' t give ten pounds to be home .	27.560472
all through july the discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands .	74.18514
on august 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as hudson knew , seen by europeans .	96.854904
to starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds .	48.22324
to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2 , 000 feet .	31.34997
hudson named the capes digges and wolstenholme , for two of his backers .	39.11295
hudson pointed the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called hudson bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the pacific .	77.672066
after three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas .	54.880306
the great `` sea to the westwards ' ' was a dead end .	37.327854
this must have been hudson ' s blackest discovery .	41.427284
for he seemed to sense at once that before him was no south sea , but the solid bulk of the north american continent .	103.26319
this was the bitter end , and hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure .	74.24593
feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .	143.32306
north and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week .	199.7504
hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to england through the `` furious overfall ' ' was again filling with ice .	51.100437
the men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .	117.38925
once more , juet ' s complaints were the loudest .	40.745045
hudson ' s reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .	95.665634
juet demanded that hudson prove his charges in an open trial .	47.074112
hudson , presiding , heard juet ' s defense , then called for testimony from crew members .	373.34753
juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward .	134.61362
hands on bible , seaman lodley and carpenter staffe swore that juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins .	41.83679
cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .	19.440004
others added that juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .	29.116339
the new mate was robert bylot , talented but inexperienced .	57.330864
there were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves .	228.963
the important result , however , was that juet and francis clemens , the deposed boatswain , became hudson ' s sworn enemies .	63.955338
as hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew ' s respect for him .	85.33158
once , after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather , hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed .	89.60067
just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .	80.75684
michael butt and adame moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .	21.892002
the anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but philip staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe .	59.15274
thomas douglas , fifth earl of selkirk , a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river of the north .	44.032818
since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the hudson ' s bay company , he purchased great blocks of the comany ' s stock with the view to controlling its policies .	64.98179
having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116 , 000 square miles in the valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers .	17.768234
the grant , which stretched southward to lake traverse -- the headwaters of the red -- was made in may , 1811 , and by october of that year a small group of scots was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay .	72.971855
thus at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle of tippecanoe , anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the north american continent to the west of the american agricultural frontier .	33.04499
seven hundred miles south of york factory , at `` the forks ' ' of the red and the assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in august 1812 .	44.141388
by october the little colony about fort douglas ( present-day winnipeg ) numbered 100 .	35.154392
within a few years the scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called meurons .	43.916557
the latter , members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the war of 1812 , had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .	55.025867
selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .	84.81894
the mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 .	128.14326
it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .	31.252945
when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the scots , swiss and metis moved up the red to the mouth of the pembina river .	40.503056
here they built huts and a stockade named fort daer after selkirk ' s barony in scotland .	50.189426
the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .	92.56943
the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by british fur traders .	42.207317
for many years the northwest company had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi river , some 300 miles southeast of present-day st . paul , minnesota .	30.729435
when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm out of the united states , its british-born employees , now become american citizens -- joseph rolette , joseph renville and alexis bailly -- continued in the fur business .	68.18368
on big stone lake near the headwaters of the red river , robert dickson , superintendent of the western indian department of canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .	51.616367
his trading goods came from canada to the forks of red river and from selkirk ' s settlement he brought them south in carts .	76.925896
these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk colony was begun .	125.72528
in 1802 henry referred to `` our new carts ' ' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack .	66.3533
they were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .	140.63132
it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states .	29.101593
in september 1817 at fort daer ( pembina ) dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of sioux , he escorted to prairie du chien .	51.888462
during the trip selkirk decided that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern united states was the best route for goods from england to reach red river and that the united states was a better source of supply for many goods than either canada or england .	82.38667
upon arriving at baltimore , selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams , secretary of state at washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` missouri and illinois territories ' ' .	104.046
this traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our settlements .	130.93794
the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .	141.63397
in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the forks ' ' ( fort douglas ) and in december 1819 , twenty men left fort daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien .	24.137604
it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on mackinac boats .	130.39432
with these completed and ice gone from the st . peter ' s river ( present-day minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to big stone lake , across into lake traverse , and down the red .	37.84493
this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk ab1 , 040 .	132.96738
nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to fort daer for food .	59.47505
thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .	59.196873
activity by british traders and the presence of a colony on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of prairie du chien , until then the most advanced united states post .	74.56948
in september 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the st . peter ' s river , the head of navigation on the mississippi , and began construction of fort st . anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , colonel josiah snelling .	42.054474
it was from the american outposts that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good .	37.106777
hercules l . dousman , fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien , contracted to supply selkirk ' s people with some 300 head of cattle , and alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers .	45.58805
bailly , after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the hudson ' s bay company ' s post on lake traverse `` in the sieux country ' ' and reached fort garry , as the selkirk hudson ' s bay company center was now called , late in the fall .	42.88154
he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward the united states .	74.578514
observing their distressing condition , colonel snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation .	53.66158
as these swiss were moving from the selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota , dousman of michilimackinac , michigan , and prairie du chien was traveling to red river to open a trade in merchandise .	46.76834
early in 1822 he was at fort garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco .	75.60039
alexander mcdonnell , governor of red river , and james bird , a chief factor of the hudson ' s bay company , ordered such `` sundry articles ' ' to a value of ab4 , 500 .	49.254692
for its part the hudson ' s bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement .	61.24729
as the time drew near for the drawing of the british-american frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the pembina colony -- its own post and fort daer -- was on american territory .	58.584675
accordingly selkirk ' s agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by october , john halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to `` the forks ' ' in rafts .	53.86225
`` i have done everything ' ' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment .	54.866386
' ' despite company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village .	84.20998
they would attempt to bring supplies from st . louis or prairie du chien at `` great expense as well as danger ' ' .	26.957258
at fort garry some of the swiss also decided to cast their lot with the united states , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to fort snelling .	88.11426
the disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave .	7.2678185
after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on october 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick .	78.5846
in april came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-june .	74.19569
on june 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the mississippi .	68.85342
by fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about fort snelling , but most of them were sent on to galena and st . louis , with a few going as far as vevay , indiana , a notable swiss center in the united states .	41.297714
in 1837 , 157 red river people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at fort snelling .	57.583168
below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the mississippi river .	34.83978
at the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by father lucian galtier in 1840 .	128.1962
its people , including pierre bottineau and other american fur company employees and the refugees from fort garry , were joined by the remaining scots and swiss from fort snelling when major joseph plympton expelled them from the reservation in may 1840 .	62.922623
the resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father galtier ' s mission , st . paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers who remained at red river .	56.576164
while population at fort garry increased rapidly , from 2 , 417 in 1831 to 4 , 369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .	59.9734
accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the hudson ' s bay company , some settlers went into trade .	77.91288
the company maintained a store at which products of england could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs .	147.72357
despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the fort garry merchants were trading with the indians for furs .	46.164047
in june 1845 , the governor and council of assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via hudson ' s bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the company ' s trade and power ' ' .	69.47751
to reduce further the flow of goods from england , the company ' s local officials asked that its london authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men .	99.86934
with their customary source of supply cut off , the fort garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the mississippi country .	151.34958
others carried pemmican from `` the forks ' ' to st . paul and goods from st . paul to red river , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the british settlement .	59.904236
this trade was subject to a tariff of 7 . 5 per cent after february 1835 , but much was smuggled into assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the london committee .	46.910667
the trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel .	111.56057
the letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .	97.16409
indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of american literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray .	56.26892
some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive .	21.845192
a confederate observed that the yankees were `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier ' ' .	24.486034
another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house ' ' .	92.83345
a third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide ' ' .	16.47526
one wrote `` ( i am so hungry ) i could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups ' ' .	61.56035
a second reported that the dilapidated houses in virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times ' ' .	132.18526
a third remarked of slowness of southerners `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god ' ' .	78.73674
still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget ' ' .	60.75991
a yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart `` my girl is none of your one-horse girls .	139.60387
she is a regular stub and twister , double geered .	64.902016
she is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and union from the muzzle to the crupper ' ' .	43.942585
a texan wrote to a male companion at home `` what has become of halda and laura ? ?	105.53713
when you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now , but love by god ' ' .	103.18783
william r . stillwell , an admirable georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the georgia department of archives and history , liked to tease his wife in his letters .	68.027016
after he had been away from home about a year he wrote `` ( dear wife ) if i did not write and receive letters from you i believe that i would forgit that i was married .	59.074127
i don ' t feel much like a maryed man but i never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if i should you must forgive me as i am so forgitful ' ' .	80.449486
a yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote `` i am growing so fat i am a burden 2 myself ' ' .	73.27825
another yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer `` now i lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o ' er my body creep	163.69943
if they should bite before i wake , i pray the lord their jaws to break ' ' .	54.550385
charles thiot , a splendid georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .	33.254494
but he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine .	170.34941
near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` fall-in ' ' and the other `` close-up ' ' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of fall-in and close-up ' ' .	39.528664
the soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the civil war armies were an earthy people .	115.823296
they talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body .	31.518372
one of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea .	93.82917
men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels ' '	29.21205
but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts ' ' .	6.4602475
a michigan soldier stationed in georgia wrote in 1864	78.39085
`` i expect to be tough as a knott as soon as i get over the georgia shitts ' ' .	35.43781
johnny rebs from the deep south who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the virginia quickstep ' ' .	98.63539
a georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea `` i have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days .	102.69515
it sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me ' ' .	33.41283
a michigan soldier wrote his brother `` i am well at present with the exception i have got the dyerear and i hope thease few lines find you the same ' ' .	84.32007
the letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .	64.18505
save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .	240.80106
most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee .	102.51755
in the south , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .	48.868893
scarcity of paper caused many southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing , i . e . , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written .	160.57301
sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .	39.55438
a yank writing from vicksburg , may 28 , 1863 , stated `` not less than 50 balls have passed over me since i commenced writing .	151.37029
i could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now ' ' .	27.279594
a reb stationed near petersburg informed his mother `` i need not tell you that i dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter .	105.58339
just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for i don ' t dodge every time ' ' .	36.946117
another reb writing under similar circumstances before atlanta reported `` the yankees keep shooting so i am afraid they will knock over my ink , so i will close ' ' .	117.35673
the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives .	86.771835
but fathers often addressed communications to their small children	109.51537
and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of civil war letters .	118.51112
rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the negro community .	39.454693
early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp negro `` body servants ' ' to perform the menial chores such as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes .	116.1722
sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners ' families .	72.68695
unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .	10.941363
owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century america , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling .	131.3109
occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in richmond , petersburg , washington , or nashville .	78.86299
an alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the virginia belles `` they thout i was a saint .	109.678635
i told them some sweet lies and they believed it all .	69.157814
i would tell them i got a letter from home stating that five of my negroes had runaway and ten of pappy ' s .	59.97509
but i wold say i recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk ' ' .	54.65629
an ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus `` dear sis .	115.07302
alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse .	121.73319
i think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as alf dyer and let that orney thefin , drunkard , damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you , the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion , he is too orney for hel .	66.34843
i will shute him as shore as i sea him ' ' .	25.923481
initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions .	126.14035
a federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in virginia `` dear pa .	35.350975
we got to one house where there were five secessionists .	107.444695
they brok & run and arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them .	64.57563
thay may say what they please but godamit pa it is fun ' ' .	28.084036
some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers .	74.01893
a mississippi soldier wrote `` our general reub davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass ' ' .	16.284826
an alabamian wrote `` col . henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn ' ' .	55.982075
a floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear ' ' .	49.778065
on december 9 , 1862 , sergeant edwin h . fay , an unusual louisianan who held a . b . and m . a . degrees from harvard university and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in louisiana , wrote his wife `` i saw pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke i ever saw .	55.43489
his head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps .	76.97602
jackson runs first and his cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader .	141.64769
but he is a west point graduate and therefore must be born to command ' ' .	74.35825
similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of northern soldiers .	41.642517
a massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a civil war version of bill mauldin , wrote `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks .	95.35176
they get all the glory and most of the pay and don ' t earn ten cents apiece on the average , the drunken rascals ' ' .	34.441734
private george gray hunter of pennsylvania wrote `` i am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago ' ' .	71.1359
another yankee became so disgusted as to state `` i wish to god one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ) ' ' .	125.485954
no group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors .	63.94171
one federal soldier wrote `` the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do ( c ) ters and offersey when this war is over ' ' .	67.55681
shortly after the beginning of sherman ' s georgia campaign , an ailing yank wrote his homefolk `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment .	70.8998
i insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that i had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) union quackery ' ' .	206.65758
the attitudes which the rebs and yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred .	101.32217
the rebs were , to a massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame ' ' .	98.11948
a pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever i saw .	182.83485
they looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings .	22.11211
' ' private jenkins lloyd jones of the wisconsin light artillery wrote in his diary `` i strolled among the alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity i think in the universe , their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect .	86.31193
they recooned as how you ' uns all would be a heap wus to we ' uns all ' ' ' .	33.349323
in a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , thomas taylor , a private in the 6th alabama volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated `` you know that my heart is with you but i never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe , by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is booty .	52.48291
the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america .	39.79766
and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world .	43.318474
thus , if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset .	28.107239
historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .	133.72314
1 ) every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .	182.38495
what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred .	144.5962
2 ) as a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness .	133.6724
its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .	87.770775
one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years .	44.198097
the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american war , the steady currency of the lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point .	89.4428
nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of american life , that learned societies such as the american folklore society and the american historical association were founded in the 1880s , or that courses in american literature , american civilization , american anything have swept our school and college curricula .	95.69657
of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century united states .	81.13832
yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .	74.21684
it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .	72.322
after all , the average american as he lies and waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen ' s comprehension and control .	115.13217
anyone ' s identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .	73.33477
such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes .	526.4923
in america , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .	171.9757
a heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land .	49.454105
but we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .	299.4105
parson weems ' s george washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting states .	86.12445
abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national constitution .	81.809685
robert e . lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .	18.1603
and their roles are paralleled by those of patrick henry , nathan hale , andrew jackson , davy crockett , theodore roosevelt and many , many more .	74.37318
therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts .	77.150566
1 ) most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all .	161.48706
2 ) the concept that an `` american national folklore ' ' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend .	93.68771
folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission .	110.14062
it has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .	26.63917
related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence .	218.12804
though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .	74.98917
in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .	108.91669
enthusiastically , americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like paul bunyan tales , abe lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition .	132.98456
nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .	97.236855
naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore .	102.79583
that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .	128.16978
as long as his material is americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic ' ' to his audience , he remains satisfied .	119.21261
from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore .	81.178375
on the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation .	75.56456
on the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western ' ' or colonial material willy-nilly .	90.57229
unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used american folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .	129.06853
after all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates .	244.73604
in addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever-expanding and changing society .	87.30012
for that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed .	77.601166
anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .	97.25731
they have little `` esprit de corps ' ' .	1.8929442
the outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque .	87.429886
his love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he doesn ' t care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote .	37.86997
folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such .	209.38664
the amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field .	43.655697
he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream ' ' reasons that many persons hunt game	223.4676
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .	35.994972
fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don ' t distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .	58.75844
but there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century german scholarship .	157.60043
both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .	43.11793
both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines .	86.40515
the commercial propagandist , who can ' t afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst ' s toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .	122.89904
his standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst .	171.93347
to both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .	88.526764
dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector .	111.94168
the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .	61.30453
the work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience .	141.30742
publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material .	204.6001
the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in .	115.22955
as a result , most people don ' t have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is	90.05736
they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there .	82.13786
and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .	114.81458
if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american public .	95.5616
and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each .	91.41382
does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz ' ' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?	66.50985
when the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? ?	147.62498
is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was ? ?	151.4396
or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? ?	309.43655
when he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged .	45.733665
in the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale .	78.18952
robert frost , for instance , writes about rural life in new england , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems .	48.47703
this has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet ' ' , simply because he is a rural one .	42.3419
in the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than frost to being `` folk writers ' ' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material .	88.090645
stephen vincent benet ' s john brown ' s body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does john steinbeck ' s the grapes of wrath and carl sandburg ' s the people , yes .	65.404785
the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass .	85.80251
folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .	276.7479
the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude .	114.31643
in fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don ' t care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits .	117.516045
nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days ' ' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .	57.37213
as part of the same arrangement , torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign , bestowed upon o ' banion a third share in the hawthorne smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade .	117.73995
o ' banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others ' .	53.067417
he had a round , frank irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone ' s body .	63.39805
he carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands .	67.175186
he killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately .	21.249771
the police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them .	44.119293
like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol .	121.864395
he was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths .	38.562935
he divided humanity into `` right guys ' ' and `` wrong guys ' ' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .	35.013367
he had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality ' ' .	15.339828
he walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns .	51.322952
landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly ' ' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath .	25.85004
he was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as torrio and capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the chicago underworld , the roughneck king .	66.54506
o ' banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant irish plasterer , in the north side ' s little hell , close by the sicilian quarter and death corner .	58.237022
he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral and also served as an acolyte to father o ' brien .	60.39927
the influence of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace	50.216152
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking .	27.581463
at the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .	73.52785
because of this he was known as gimpy ( but , as with capone and his nickname of scarface , never in his presence ) .	74.5495
in his teens o ' banion was enrolled in the vicious market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgovern ' s cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out .	73.119125
he then got a job with the chicago herald-examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper ' s news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors .	48.419277
he was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary , later committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor .	51.503483
o ' banion ' s first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to bridewell prison for three months for burglary	61.098526
two years later he served another three months for assault .	111.92011
those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .	165.31827
but by now o ' banion ' s political pull was beginning to be effective .	138.00145
on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10 , 000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed .	36.54149
on one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant john j . ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the postal telegraph building	103.064644
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30 , 000 in bribes , it was estimated .	29.916056
as promptly as torrio , o ' banion jumped into bootlegging .	9.943328
he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the sicilians , but he had his huge north side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money .	71.00871
unlike the sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .	27.872686
he was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 o ' banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state `` i always deliver my borough as per requirements ' ' .	85.615906
until 1924 o ' banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his north side domain solidly democratic .	207.49533
there was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time q . `` who ' ll carry the forty-second and forty-third wards ' ' ? ?	23.401505
a . o ' banion , in his pistol pocket ' ' .	8.479823
but as november 1924 drew close the democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that o ' banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important republicans .	61.49252
to forestall any change of allegiance , the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o ' banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .	88.497185
the reception was held in a private dining room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west .	117.00002
it was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .	41.163303
the guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of american civic life at this time .	33.23434
it included the top o ' banion men and chief of detectives michael hughes .	153.9356
when mayor dever heard of the banquet he summoned hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers .	56.929157
hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of jerry o ' connor , the proprieter of a loop gambling house .	90.19965
`` but when i arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , i knew i had been framed , and withdrew almost at once ' ' .	93.72082
in fact , o ' connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin .	34.754967
there was a brief interruption while one of o ' banion ' s men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip .	56.679016
then o ' banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .	31.152174
this dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth ' ' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` belshazzar feasts ' ' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels ' ' .	37.90488
pasley continued `` they became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 ' ' .	81.180855
however , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .	198.9468
o ' banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better republican deal .	134.53008
on election day -- november 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes .	70.36658
the result was a landslide for the republican candidates .	11.552262
this further demonstration of o ' banion ' s ballooning power did not please torrio and capone .	44.67921
in the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .	47.161316
he behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .	48.221737
they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , yankee schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by dave miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with torrio and o ' banion , frank , a policeman , and max , the youngest .	53.420776
to settle this slight , o ' banion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop , where , he had learned , dave miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy .	36.233086
at the end of the performance , dave and max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .	47.81809
o ' banion drew his guns and fired at dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .	46.61326
a second bullet ricocheted off max ' s belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .	55.90914
o ' banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre	50.45572
that sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of torrio and capone , was a nonsense .	41.08666
a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street and demanded $300 to let it through .	140.15266
one of the beer-runners telephoned o ' banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation .	112.84537
o ' banion ' s reaction was `` three hundred dollars ! !	150.31606
why , i can get them knocked off for half that much ' ' .	83.94789
upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if o ' banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen .	92.34502
but in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned torrio and returned to o ' banion with the message `` say , dionie , i just been talking to johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred .	87.14735
he says he don ' t want no trouble ' ' .	14.092413
but torrio and capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman .	29.200745
for three years , since the liquor territorial conference , torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated o ' banion ' s impudent double-crossing .	51.533783
they had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in cicero .	147.75421
when , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election , torrio had given o ' banion a slice of cicero , the profits from that district had been $20 , 000 a month .	55.19963
in six months o ' banion had boosted the profits to $100 , 000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb .	75.902466
these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the sheldon , saltis-mcerlane , and druggan-lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the torrio-capone saloons	75.06434
once again o ' banion ' s brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .	204.2109
the revenue from o ' banion ' s cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the torrio-capone takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago ' s south and west sides .	136.42537
but he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate .	26.522356
at last , even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that o ' banion should take a percentage in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer concession .	69.65793
o ' banion ' s reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .	80.12682
still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the o ' banion gang ' s seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of canadian whisky worth $100 , 000 and by one of the biggest coups of the prohibition era -- the sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .	48.890266
here was stored $1 , 000 , 000 worth of bonded whisky .	27.295229
these 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the o ' banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water .	72.854935
a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption .	55.22651
the most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883	49.44314
it raced across the pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of java and sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as san francisco .	54.957718
the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves .	166.6902
whether or not plato ' s tale of the lost continent of atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times .	88.1583
indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the arabian sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the biblical story of the flood .	77.34298
one of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november 1 , 1755	70.81263
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the english coast .	144.70581
tsunami are rare , however , in the atlantic ocean	672.977
they are far more common in the pacific .	4.249146
japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 .	25.735292
the hawaiian islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years .	86.303444
in 1707 an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the inland sea	162.8668
one wave swamped more than 1 , 000 ships and boats in osaka bay .	77.306625
a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been .	135.88773
in 1896 a japanese tsunami killed 27 , 000 people and swept away 10 , 000 homes .	53.28824
the dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .	79.32413
an ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the atlantic or 1 , 000 feet in the pacific .	25.516876
but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest .	26.827627
while a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .	35.532032
the greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave	84.20556
lagrange ' s law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity .	74.80471
in the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour .	62.46571
tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .	93.03845
their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest .	51.246002
usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights .	63.08738
on the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells .	108.48792
not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .	50.686478
the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .	49.092377
the giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .	50.20435
they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .	65.56807
generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .	101.01078
this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .	73.3181
reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish .	32.752735
at hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach .	49.484604
many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore .	44.22103
after an earthquake in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground .	92.03173
when a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides .	21.919033
just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them .	55.724377
a tsunami is not a single wave but a series .	140.99384
the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .	78.668434
the waves may keep coming for many hours .	3.1609156
usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest .	75.483604
among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at hilo was francis p . shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography , one of the world ' s foremost marine geologists .	18.091276
he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves .	18.099585
their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling .	24.143145
the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .	68.51131
on some of the islands ' beaches the waves came in gently	232.42131
they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come .	78.00805
in hilo bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .	37.667965
the highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at pololu valley .	35.24118
scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon .	29.602982
during a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night .	17.820494
the luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea .	32.03574
japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs	42.590115
the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance .	26.08819
the waves of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3 , 000 feet .	59.28416
gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .	11.340884
the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by commander c . k . green of the coast and geodetic survey staff .	78.88702
it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface .	112.10984
but when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit .	72.64575
this in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress .	70.53142
such equipment has been installed at hilo , midway , attu and dutch harbor .	24.128115
the moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .	34.662548
this center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with seismographs .	67.530754
its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami .	74.36683
by means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific .	97.548615
the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps .	119.328125
all of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .	103.56596
since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the pacific , but only one was of any consequence .	77.139305
on november 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula .	20.593142
at 17 07 that afternoon ( greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in honolulu .	38.047302
within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in alaska , arizona and california , the quake ' s epicenter was placed at 51 degrees north latitude and 158 degrees east longitude .	43.170002
while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific ( midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at 23 30 greenwich time .	129.64148
it turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 .	129.1227
they hurled a cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .	93.81154
but not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the hawaiian islands did not exceed $800 , 000 .	45.495975
there is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .	162.22714
but it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough .	64.54263
in the vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves .	155.36673
the key to the world of geology is change	9416.197
life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .	94.08611
the land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .	48.8609
earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break .	157.39136
sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface	52.92615
often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there	72.991
and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried .	226.47328
today ' s earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth ' s restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them .	63.79391
the effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .	56.011475
the role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster .	165.09982
superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .	331.1624
we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth ' s interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .	109.61118
these waves have shown that 1 , 800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core .	65.40469
earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths .	40.77103
two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .	3.9730184
( 1 ) as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .	100.99859
( 2 ) if earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ?	117.10858
knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields .	47.378334
in the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources .	134.75073
we have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate .	100.96031
the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book causes of catastrophe by l . don leet .	65.44974
at twelve minutes after five on the morning of wednesday , april 18 , 1906 , san francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .	36.162716
a sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll .	29.152426
in ireland ' s county limerick , near the river shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen , which means `` garden of owen ' ' .	35.885822
undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on american military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name .	108.67934
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes , sioux and apaches , mexican banditos under pancho villa , japanese in the south pacific , and chinese and north korean communists in korea .	49.63717
garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u . s . cavalry regiment , `` the fighting seventh ' ' .	14.775195
today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .	53.453926
but don ' t tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh , especially in a saloon on saturday night .	60.605133
of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than lieutenant colonel melbourne c . chandler .	80.8504
wiry and burr-headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper .	31.178879
the truth is , however , that when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil .	95.759155
chandler had been commissioned in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it .	51.77093
though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces .	95.211464
the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of troop h , 7th cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan .	51.751865
outside of combat , he couldn ' t have landed in a tougher spot .	73.36052
first of all , no unit likes to have a new co brought in from the outside , especially when he ' s an armchair trooper .	81.65609
second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it ' s on maneuvers .	64.87343
in combat , helping your co make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed .	238.5013
but in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it ' s easy .	55.791004
but his first few days with troop h were full of surprises , beginning with first sergeant robert early .	168.33124
chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .	57.74988
instead sergeant early was quiet , sharp and confident .	29.729168
he had enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade .	153.56705
there was no weapon early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .	269.17526
he could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .	78.924835
further , he had taken full advantage of the army ' s correspondence courses .	36.39174
he not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .	35.500862
but for all his erudite confidence , sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold .	206.7959
he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh .	6.815018
sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army .	40.398914
he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment .	64.84114
for example , it was a battalion of the 7th cavalry under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the battle of the little big horn .	28.6089
it didn ' t take captain chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of troop aj .	51.64942
but what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment .	92.108116
maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in tokyo , captain chandler still with them .	139.88248
it was the 7th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial palace of the emperor .	54.88709
but still mel chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word , `` garryowen ' ' .	57.948605
it happened at the st . patrick ' s day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an irish march .	75.30195
in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .	102.19834
the faces belonged to lieutenant marvin goulding , his wife and their two children .	52.67373
and when the singing began , it was the gouldings who sang the old irish songs the best .	109.802345
though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about marvin goulding , the jewish officer from chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange .	39.050987
for marvin goulding , like giovanni martini , the bugler boy who carried custer ' s last message , or margarito lopez , the one-man army on leyte , was a garryowen , through and through .	87.63239
it was no coincidence that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment .	28.591019
and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen .	11.538626
he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment .	39.802944
one of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop .	131.38742
even the mess sergeant , bill brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range .	56.824554
the troop received a new leader , lieutenant robert m . carroll , fresh out of rotc and bucking for regular army status .	88.892105
carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that ra berth , and he wanted to play it cool .	96.69902
so mel chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before .	75.671585
when the korean war began , on june 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of leyte during world war 2 , , the 7th cavalry was not in the best fighting condition .	38.23366
its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world war 2 .	129.72873
just a month after the korean war broke out , the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat .	38.30841
from then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in korea .	40.282665
one night on the naktong river , mel chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps .	100.91002
the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .	29.421661
the troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn ' t know when , and they didn ' t know where .	15.324592
at 6 o ' clock on the morning of august 12 , they were in doubt no longer .	49.40885
the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with russian machine guns , attacked the position held by chandler ' s men .	88.359886
first came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram .	48.038113
they were followed by crack north korean troops , who mounted one charge after another .	140.33154
they overran the 7th cav ' s forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead .	136.27902
another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .	39.400333
captain chandler saw that it was building up strength .	744.8743
he assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .	68.95849
one of the more seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll , the young officer bucking for the regular army .	36.566143
chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .	127.222946
he took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run .	53.877293
the first thing he knew the words `` garryowen ' ' ! !	6.7615166
his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran .	163.89665
the koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire .	22.191948
chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran .	56.342697
it was bob carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of garryowen .	29.750044
he had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge .	89.5024
because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again .	72.84601
but an enemy grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .	130.76361
he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire .	30.446098
enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .	231.12404
they found it at the junction between troops h and g , and prepared to counterattack .	42.50093
`` okay , men ' ' , he said .	3.9774883
goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` garryowen ' ' ! !	10.940313
but the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding fell dead .	55.7031
for an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead .	64.603264
then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` garryowen ' ' ! !	21.350302
they charged into the enemy like wild men .	4.4622235
that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll had begun .	75.199646
goulding ' s platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack .	54.196815
reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by goulding ' s platoon .	38.516907
the north koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies .	32.33214
artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .	75.60532
though bob carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived .	149.88176
today he is a major -- in the regular army .	53.666004
so filled was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment .	61.254566
after years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , of garryowen and glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit .	87.51551
the battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off .	75.70208
for nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment .	76.32773
take the case of major marcus a . reno , who survived the battle of the little big horn in 1876 .	58.937244
from the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus reno .	133.46927
many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him .	11.160497
but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him .	80.18592
he was a member of the fighting seventh .	4.035892
although it was at the battle of the little horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in american history , that the 7th cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then .	96.3893
brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment ' s first permanent commander and , like such generals as george s . patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military prominence , custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare .	116.85473
during the civil war , custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 .	90.117065
he finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the u . s . army .	41.48198
i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them .	36.95193
if they were , walter lippmann would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky , and herb lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about .	147.04356
i do mean , however , that i take them for granted , and that everything i shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions .	143.36365
the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity	78.09149
and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states .	42.096546
i speak of `` the largest possible measure ' ' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around .	77.314445
these conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense i have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world communism .	172.02515
this is true for two reasons because communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions	70.851105
and because communists have the will and , as long as soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .	62.70598
moreover , as communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote .	121.1366
it follows that victory over communism is the dominant , proximate goal of american policy .	44.788715
proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive ' ' ends we seek , to which victory over communism is but a means .	104.55178
but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .	135.28064
but if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin , then we must fight .	62.058765
freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective	37.077026
but if granting self-determination to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the sino-soviet orbit , then algerian freedom must be postponed .	99.40545
but if justice for bantus entails driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west , then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer .	100.79517
but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made .	75.703705
it may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism	71.53336
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of soviet communist power .	55.384216
this much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .	68.171814
this brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .	71.28174
i submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .	45.31131
and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of american policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously .	118.041595
in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .	59.659622
the other , for the most part , true .	199.06485
the first was that america had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .	97.41953
i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .	78.287346
you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- i certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all american strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of u . s . -soviet relations for the foreseeable future .	110.58989
i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts , and i think mr . jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth .	121.981834
suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the soviets ' position `` there would be more than 2 , 000 modern soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in mexico and the caribbean .	85.24508
overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast .	20.854162
half of the population of the u . s . would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people ' ' .	36.384544
add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .	81.45709
add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength .	94.75985
if we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of khrushchev ' s nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .	54.849827
the other charge was that america ' s political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .	46.985588
the contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it .	56.79741
the argument was typically advanced in terms of u . s . `` prestige ' ' .	15.243956
prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem	8.634902
and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .	17.6093
prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill .	184.39384
but contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .	55.871033
only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .	125.49409
the thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it .	59.061424
the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .	54.936493
this ignorant estimate , i repeat , is not of any interest in itself	107.65542
but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side .	117.8015
to the extent , then , that declining u . s . prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .	70.681435
still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves .	60.171852
here i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? ?	141.38634
and is western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ?	61.7206
in answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded the success of communism ' s war against the west does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .	108.59765
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence .	40.89478
communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages .	159.49345
fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they could not win , the communists seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the united nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level .	59.531403
the soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against the west .	76.6466
thus , typically , the first stage of a communist takeover is to `` neutralize ' ' a country .	45.168255
the second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist ' ' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy .	72.71475
and this may be as far as the process will go .	213.62263
the kremlin ' s goal is the isolation and capture , not of ghana , but of the united states -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist ' ' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the soviet foreign office .	60.08753
to recite the particulars of recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring .	98.39319
six years ago french indochina , though in troubie , was in the western camp .	45.4115
cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist .	1759.8381
indonesia , in the early days of the republic , leaned toward the west .	52.922268
today sukarno ' s government is heavily besieged by avowed communists , and for all of its `` neutralist ' ' pretensions , it is a firm ally of soviet policy .	34.017815
ceylon has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west .	22.925238
in the middle east , iraq , syria and egypt were , a short while ago , in the western camp .	89.90495
today the nasser and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west , are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel	71.67042
in almost every particular follow the kremlin ' s foreign policy line .	30.792067
a short time ago all africa was a western preserve .	304.4381
never mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west .	53.25195
today , africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging , it would seem , into the soviet orbit .	26.15898
latin america was once an area as `` safe ' ' for the west as nebraska was for nixon .	65.29121
one latin american country , cuba , has become a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast .	73.998604
in some countries the trend has gone further than others mexico , panama , and venezuela are displaying open sympathy for castroism , and there is no country -- save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where castroism and anti-americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause .	83.9828
only in europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface .	148.4535
the strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in england , and even in germany .	39.245396
what have we to show by way of counter-successes ? ?	73.4267
we have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron curtain .	45.341038
there was the hungarian revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .	72.9609
there was the polish revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests .	267.59872
there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended did not exist .	90.632126
only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing communist power in guatemala .	143.36455
and contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures ' ' and `` world opinion ' ' to bring down that communist government	59.632233
we moved decisively to effect an anti-communist coup d ' etat .	11.511456
we served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery .	204.05196
the first rattle of the machine guns , at 7 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear .	133.0848
`` sounds exactly like last time ' ' .	3.368377
the young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven .	54.7403
the middle-aged man said over and over , `` why did i come here , why did i come here ' ' .	26.270903
amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , i heard the thumping of mortars .	54.186024
this was my second day in vientiane , the administrative capital of laos , and my thoughts were none too brave .	93.10764
better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick .	51.970547
chinese and indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters .	36.865303
hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby .	3.9952412
a woman with a small boy slipped in between them .	205.67815
`` please ' ' , she said , `` please ' ' .	12.390977
she held out her hand to show that she had money .	34.8238
the american newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office .	160.78517
had the communist-led pathet lao finally come this far ? ?	95.2656
or was it another revolt inside vientiane ? ?	1.0480961
`` let ' s play hero ' ' , i said .	18.627937
`` let ' s go to the roof and see ' ' .	11.79507
there had been an eclipse of the moon .	6.949058
a traditional lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms .	47.9388
the din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around .	95.96531
how quaint it all seemed the next day .	5.2592454
a restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks ' ' .	172.81839
but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later .	434.74597
and no wonder , for vientiane , the old city of sandalwood , had become the city of bullet holes .	47.270645
i saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets .	60.514748
along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered .	50.02299
in place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble .	70.48589
mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door .	107.988785
what had been the ambassador ' s suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick .	110.51915
this damage had been done in the battle of vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( december 9-11 , 1960 ) .	78.99698
and now , in march , all laos suffered a state of siege .	63.980865
the pathet lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .	277.92007
throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .	31.222923
`` and it ' s all the more tragic because it ' s so little deserved ' ' , said mr . j . j . a . frans , a belgian official of the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization .	37.584023
we talked after i hailed his jeep marked with the u . n . flag .	13.639817
practically all the people of laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows .	158.69902
they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls .	98.65812
nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .	50.623615
they spread over an area no larger than oregon	2044.7087
yet they include peoples as different from one another as oregonians are from patagonians .	115.14195
faith in the buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits	74.54343
and to live in harmony with nature ' ' .	1.8172457
`` precisely ' ' , said mr . frans .	120.90197
he spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest .	30.979155
the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering mekong river .	2.5081136
shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside .	31.744879
for so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast .	66.77663
to many a frenchman -- they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti .	83.65131
yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe .	79.4733
the pathet lao , stiffened by communist veterans from neighboring north viet nam , were supplied by soviet aircraft .	26.68703
the royal lao army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with american funds .	51.65255
in six years , u . s . aid had amounted to more than $1 . 60 for each american -- a total of three hundred million dollars .	61.283077
we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened to ignite another war among the world ' s giants .	46.727238
even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ? ?	144.29846
to find out , we traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the royal lao army from attopeu , the city of buffalo dung in the southeast , to muong sing , the city of lions in the northwest , close to communist china ( map , page 250 ) .	52.024887
we rode over roads so rough that our jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .	125.80798
we flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn ' t crash .	38.83055
in the end we ran into communist artillery fire .	35.30056
`` we ' ' were bill garrett of the national geographic illustrations staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met	258.54935
boun my -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in savannakhet , the border of paradise .	76.38871
he had attended three universities in the united states .	1.8610387
but he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of vientiane , including the royal capital , luang prabang .	42.12796
before the airplanes came , he said , travel in laos was just about impossible .	384.58914
alas , so it almost proved for us , too .	24.350737
to go outside the few cities required permits .	17.031584
and getting them seemed a life ' s work .	30.534212
nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts .	53.178135
we were told that to the pathet lao , a kidnaped american was worth at least $750 , a fortune in laos .	44.937057
everyone had heard of the american contractor who had spurned an escort .	21.184042
now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil american intervention .	190.65926
although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in french , we were getting nowhere .	221.35577
we had nearly decided that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the prime minister .	52.443436
could we be ready in 15 minutes ? ?	1.1135205
his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off .	35.18275
and so , after a flight southeast to savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun oum of champassak , a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from texas .	52.983913
from his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a luger .	7.3594766
with our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust .	177.42497
in keng kok , the city of silkworms , the prime minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .	17.693031
then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls .	124.59059
an hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary .	37.37529
more bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well .	163.75394
then off again , rushing to keep up .	78.012215
but our two jeep mates -- keo viphakone from luang prabang and john cool from beaver , pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust .	61.936142
together they had probably done more than any other men to help push laos toward the 20th century -- constructively .	92.36038
mr . keo , once a diplomat in paris and washington , was commissioner of rural affairs .	57.517303
john , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the london school of economics , headed the rural development division of usom , the united states operations mission administering u . s . aid .	62.68
`` what you see are self-help projects ' ' , john said .	24.40663
`` we ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor .	80.88649
we send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs .	44.591934
that way they have an infirmary for $400 .	3.6792717
we have 2 , 500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools .	92.49892
`` our people have been used to accepting things as they found them ' ' , he said .	22.538572
`` where there was no road , they lived without one .	244.4975
now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence .	159.24039
that ' s a big step toward a modern state .	73.848854
you might say we are in the nation-building business ' ' .	31.010118
in the villages people lined up to give us flowers .	107.782845
then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine .	10.879869
the prime minister paid his respects to the buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech .	51.07938
the soldiers are fighting and the americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself .	51.548065
but our stumping tour of the south wasn ' t all misery .	26.688744
crossing the 4 , 000-foot width of the mekong at champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze .	78.104034
briefly we rolled over a paved road up to pak song , on the cool bolovens plateau .	45.919224
the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood , supported by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song .	46.6548
in the village of soukhouma , which means `` peaceful ' ' , we had a baci .	29.235086
this is the most endearing of lao ceremonies .	3.3454974
it takes place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the new year , for any good purpose .	60.9093
the preparations were elaborate flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string .	28.045515
the strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) .	17.17082
the candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables .	31.03988
i was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone ' s head , where the worthiest spirits reside .	96.75907
now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us .	88.82796
a man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body .	25.93302
those souls like to wander off , and must be called back .	82.98407
with the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power .	119.4884
then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists .	191.32024
these were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls .	80.94626
as we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to john cool and silently showed him his hand .	109.01956
it had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .	29.931316
john said `` i have some antiseptic salve with me , but it ' s too late for that ' ' .	20.715893
my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds .	82.36071
jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings .	7.335587
`` being jewish gives you tremendous drive ' ' , a boy remarked .	11.613617
`` it means that you have to get ahead ' ' .	9.866366
when i pressed for a purely religious definition , i encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty .	115.742516
`` i like the tradition ' ' , a girl said .	93.925186
`` i like to follow the holidays when they come along .	25.771034
but you don ' t have to worship in the traditional way .	13.456478
as i see it , there ' s no real difference between being jewish , catholic , or protestant ' ' .	42.091236
another teen-ager remarked `` most jews don ' t believe in god , but they believe in people -- in helping people ' ' .	43.89826
still another boy asserted `` to be a good jew is to do no wrong	115.54092
it ' s to be a good person ' ' .	2.2948523
when asked how this was different from being a good protestant , the boy answered , `` it ' s the same thing ' ' .	24.594051
this accords with the study by maier and spinrad .	3.6129296
they discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this conviction .	43.69603
the most important aims of the jewish students were as follows to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent	117.713455
to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent	1.0441275
nevertheless , most of the teen-agers i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .	236.62552
however , they were hostile to jewish orthodoxy , professing to believe in judaism `` but in a moderate way ' ' .	51.072998
one boy said querulously about orthodox jews `` it ' s the twentieth century , and they don ' t have to wear beards ' ' .	14.105936
the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers ' minds .	168.8421
`` we were brought up that way ' ' was one statement which won general assent .	111.592705
`` i want to show respect for my parents ' religion ' ' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism .	90.19488
still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since i ' ll be living in a suburb ' ' .	52.180508
intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval .	122.62398
most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds .	173.70808
`` when you marry , you want to have things in common ' ' , a girl said , `` and it ' s hard when you don ' t marry someone with your own background ' ' .	24.865807
a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle west observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious .	100.831085
it appears that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .	94.27576
another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only orthodox girl in town ' ' .	51.548676
this is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant .	259.50708
one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented .	51.700787
sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning .	115.68921
this is substantially higher than the figures for the american population at large -- 45 . 6 per cent for males and 29 . 2 per cent for females .	44.926422
this may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy .	25.571732
in their first two years in high school , jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .	98.22027
however , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement .	55.82432
it is significant , too , that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts .	65.32935
the percentage of jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .	105.43919
the motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different .	48.81246
the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed .	77.06049
one of the significant developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .	105.58978
it is they who read -- and make -- jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them .	65.89159
in upper teen jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality .	26.286676
`` people automatically assume that i ' m in college ' ' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably .	24.636236
however , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college .	58.063915
the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student .	123.74087
she is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .	285.54315
one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .	42.51667
this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york , chicago , and philadelphia .	45.67736
what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish world .	92.89765
perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class jewish student .	57.863342
there is , to begin , an important sex difference .	459.34573
typically , in a lower-middle class jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college .	96.78474
first , the girl ' s education has a lower priority than the son ' s .	72.1104
second , the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son .	218.77773
most jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home .	85.16593
the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .	64.42803
one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .	74.09266
brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school .	52.510532
on the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school .	71.150116
this is particularly acute for those who attended midwood high school directly across the street from brooklyn college .	47.516186
they have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school .	150.84842
at the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .	94.704384
`` it ' s people of your own kind ' ' , a girl remarked .	25.15891
`` you don ' t have to watch what you say .	69.06673
of course , i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but i would want lots of jewish kids there ' ' .	29.13959
for most brooklyn college students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family .	75.59354
brooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing .	80.57195
however , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents .	134.0111
and the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping .	74.251144
`` as long as i ' m home , i ' ll never grow up ' ' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly .	22.139456
`` they don ' t like it if i do anything away from home .	75.9554
it ' s so much trouble , i don ' t usually bother ' ' .	9.776013
for girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive .	12.649524
parents will drive on friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting .	137.8515
a freshman girl ' s father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn college and demanded the `` low-down ' ' on a boy who was going out with his daughter .	60.512962
the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .	36.97792
under pressure from parents , the majority of brooklyn college girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours .	712.501
this means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature .	101.510475
a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex .	55.730648
the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual .	397.65802
first , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights .	60.99307
then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of new york .	81.397644
it is significant that the catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of new york , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps .	77.29122
but it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- fire island , nantucket , westhampton , long island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously jewish .	59.319534
although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in europe .	63.73614
in general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith .	140.44121
and acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years .	103.33983
brooklyn college is marjorie morningstar territory , as much as the bronx or central park west .	112.50812
there are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry .	96.18887
it is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate .	61.092148
`` almost everybody in the senior class is married ' ' , students say dogmatically .	115.67796
and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the house plan association ) that have good news to impart .	99.03991
these announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts .	59.728878
there are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity .	31.74473
`` witt house happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz of fife house ' ' .	28.875706
the brooklyn college student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .	70.05806
the ivy league enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down ivy way .	58.83843
the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes .	122.55628
among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking .	113.55247
brooklyn college is distinctive for not having an official drinking place .	328.70578
the fort lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys .	185.37912
this should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) .	576.77014
for galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste .	29.791609
this could also be used for any other skin irritation .	64.37988
or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts .	71.54872
`` female troubles ' ' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier	56.34616
at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation .	98.58997
bruises , burns , cuts , etc . , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too .	179.14716
bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak .	12.403269
( doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain .	105.76217
) salted butter was another cure for bruises .	3.380589
many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water	32.995663
the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts .	99.586586
another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter .	49.935207
`` butter salve ' ' or `` butter ointment ' ' was used for burns , and for bruises as well .	9.813173
this was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil	36.065853
when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled .	25.608015
cow ' s milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly .	45.15333
one man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time .	39.3093
a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat ' ' .	54.95418
later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns .	41.992443
the results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known .	138.9794
to stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds .	72.15353
one old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool	68.64695
this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .	121.703995
my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds	65.58357
she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine .	81.20079
he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated	81.23224
a `` chaw ' ' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing .	100.18777
or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing .	53.82993
one old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head .	44.60291
his brother ran a mile to get the father	3447.425
when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices .	60.419197
then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place .	27.855127
there was no cleaning or further care , but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar .	60.71974
veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic .	38.2777
until quite recently , `` sterile ' ' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound	74.51446
they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated .	84.45366
tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .	51.643806
one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .	62.095173
another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke .	64.89085
rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones ' ' which the pioneer wore or carried .	68.85591
in 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in norton county , and one had been in the family for 200 years .	60.59768
another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker .	36.735813
while nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation .	117.963104
since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid .	97.96782
this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) .	47.344334
nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient ' s neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life .	29.910057
or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears .	36.30949
old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water .	133.30919
blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance .	198.90108
felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine	74.95288
this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part .	83.108696
as the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed ' ' .	35.275158
`` get a bite , spit on it ' ' was a proverb .	18.130093
yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings	104.428116
not long ago `` denver mud ' ' was most popular .	115.98428
chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived	72.04919
so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they buried themselves in the victim ' s flesh .	43.697433
bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests .	62.784367
ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing .	4.4086804
for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made .	20.94351
for wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief .	83.86679
a handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water	254.73555
mud was sometimes used as well as soap .	12.898641
just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings .	38.27787
to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900 ' s , was a chore .	27.62505
bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather .	57.835644
kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .	18.377531
at times pioneer children got lice in their hair .	46.297028
a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job .	33.064716
to remove an insect from one ' s ear warm water should be inserted .	255.14473
a cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye .	30.184164
as the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation , and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out .	63.596035
another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed	240.69867
the particle would then move toward the nose , where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton .	38.2917
shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations .	59.382137
for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth .	79.13522
itching skin , considered `` just nerves ' ' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .	32.178658
winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped .	37.472324
to cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water .	106.775925
they drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution .	57.042744
six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies .	48.511326
frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow .	86.852806
now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead .	56.08262
another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains .	9.031616
chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves .	80.322655
boils have always been a source of much trouble .	18.356691
a german informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice .	87.176605
another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree , steeped in water until it formed a sticky , gummy solution .	56.559143
another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns .	50.134937
one veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire ' ' .	35.253197
another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight .	75.5592
this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .	89.68654
one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times .	86.60963
another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days .	43.854664
saliva gathered in the mouth after a night ' s sleep was considered poisonous	174.55428
wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that .	103.86883
one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy .	49.353207
another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week .	62.717194
a simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way .	70.29209
one person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water	126.632416
another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily .	326.9979
another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment	57.97033
the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave .	30.850912
as the onion decayed , so did the wart .	18.62437
sore feet by calf ' s-foot , an herb from the pioneer ' s ubiquitous herb garden , or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved .	48.233143
leg cramps , one person tells me , were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard .	75.54154
this does give relief , as i can testify .	48.065437
one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps .	34.616867
pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient ' s waist .	42.230373
for sprains and swellings , one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief .	76.429375
except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one ' s dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him .	117.02245
in instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal .	110.66501
it may , on occasion , be anything but that .	193.08559
however , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine .	108.121765
again , by spreading one ' s purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad .	116.437065
this is important because , despite all the efforts of the french government , an appreciable segment of france ' s export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas .	55.918526
a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them	74.57418
he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district .	226.89214
these are the wines the french themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in france virtually no one drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis .	97.6408
the grands crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them .	12.593063
and certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown .	106.69917
there is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper .	52.59733
some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse .	85.349525
consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown ' ' -- are the requisites .	74.136024
especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts .	69.047005
most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and some other latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself .	100.35799
now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! !	110.25149
) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all .	109.25682
this is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter .	65.91251
a really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the visigoths .	72.347046
faced , on the one hand , with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines , and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks , it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence .	47.655598
the one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .	188.72252
only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains .	67.055084
wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .	50.632286
this is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort .	119.56637
it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .	58.80847
wine stored for a long time should be on its side	292.1776
otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it .	13.342524
when stacking wine on its side in a bin , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork .	55.648724
fat bottles , such as burgundies , have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props , such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood , to hold them in the proper reclining posture .	56.23692
too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects .	209.16989
the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right	149.02495
if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion .	761.8952
seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it prematurely .	316.4348
the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees , with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes .	73.57551
consequently , one ' s wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces .	61.68559
if one lives near a subway or an express parkway , the solution is to have one ' s wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time .	59.63067
light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine .	21.953457
all in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking	131.21745
many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork .	62.271244
no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !	145.607
but the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .	126.86081
a white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes	44.925903
for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow .	19.031635
though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .	59.74927
but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full .	76.34644
in this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ) , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .	68.17532
the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire .	104.22744
this invariably effaces any wine ' s character , and drives its fragrance underground .	143.07663
it should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in magnums -- and slower yet in tregnums , double magnums , jeroboams , methuselahs , and imperiales , respectively .	50.304913
very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air .	61.91293
white wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .	108.79201
thus , sauternes or barsacs should be very cold	169.22197
a pouilly-fuisse or a chablis somewhat less cold .	3.492853
over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .	105.40496
the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .	118.48671
to quote professor saintsbury `` the last glass of claret or burgundy is as good as the first	49.295067
but the first glass of chateau d ' yquem or montrachet is a great deal better than the last ' ' ! !	24.089897
this does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .	82.972206
if this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place	147.8971
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk .	32.33619
a few red wines , notably those of the beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .	59.88233
by tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well .	164.74255
thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken	237.20326
very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself .	95.24075
a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea .	66.17746
the cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward .	50.93574
many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment .	83.76248
another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .	92.806046
in france , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them .	115.308266
the wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted .	76.693214
it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .	65.35587
for , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs .	83.06377
though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten .	122.47397
red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer	125.04496
the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red burgundy .	360.73895
some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more .	37.794586
if a red bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while .	133.99486
most of the wines of beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young	59.92992
giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically `` rest assured that your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter and spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views ' ' .	109.081024
giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation .	3.5615888
the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john palfrey ' s overseer .	55.81466
william , who lived in neighboring st . mary ' s parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .	55.368687
giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation .	158.9319
if sold then , the land and improvements might bring only $5 , 000 .	85.495224
early in january , 1844 he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans , and upon learning of gorham ' s intention , henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother .	69.04944
the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless negroes .	49.34168
they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and louisiana law required their removal from the state .	66.154015
gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the north involved ? ?	109.66007
the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic , since no planter would take the risk of having negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves .	78.830315
henry hid his annoyance , although both he and william were furious with their yankee brother .	126.02846
william , who did not write to gorham , told giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue `` amicably ' ' to protect his interests .	52.64631
palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation .	111.74953
if william wished to continue operations for a year , why not simply leave the negroes undisturbed and pay them `` as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age .	258.9737
a disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme .	71.26165
their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement ' ' .	82.992744
when he heard of his brothers ' anger , palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages .	46.359756
if not , he was willing to accede to william ' s wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim .	81.79131
william was adamant on one point under no circumstances would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his and henry ' s slaves if they were told of their coming freedom .	68.25274
knowing the antipathy that existed in louisiana against increasing the number of free negroes , giffen suggested that palfrey bring them to boston at once , and then send them on to liberia .	88.87774
lacking specific instructions , he agreed to william ' s condition .	22.24736
in march there was a division of the slaves , and giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible .	68.31202
of the fifty-two slaves , giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females .	85.96439
`` i considered that your views would be best carried out ' ' , he explained , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of emancipation .	107.11147
i have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience & justice ' ' .	81.70914
the ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child .	33.486385
if palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited .	71.03049
this cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed .	126.13073
each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value .	153.56638
old sam ' s sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150	262.1776
rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 .	35.19162
in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property , palfrey was giving up close to $7 , 000 .	46.956886
palfrey ' s brothers each received lots of sixteen negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6 , 666 . 66 .	49.46045
thus twenty `` black souls ' ' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men .	45.122276
giffen extracted one concession from william the house servants could be free at any time gorham thought expedient .	138.53021
despite giffen ' s warning , palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in louisiana .	98.102875
yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special permission .	98.1317
according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed .	29.096243
palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement .	110.26942
otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain ' ' .	62.406464
on march 11 the louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition .	57.221207
news of the legislative veto appeared in the new orleans papers , and henry and william became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance .	44.215908
henry stormed into giffen ' s office waving a copy of the new orleans courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the `` ears of the people on the plantation , and make them restless & unhappy ' ' .	40.0899
his brothers ' anger caused palfrey genuine concern , for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself to free his slaves , and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue .	81.33502
when giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey , gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him .	71.815636
in view of these difficulties , palfrey decided to go to louisiana .	32.040176
giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters .	74.46494
his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-april .	32.613293
palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for new orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence that he might be allowed to see his family again .	44.571392
during his journey palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists .	209.06917
in both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the north .	68.78897
in new york , lydia maria child welcomed him enthusiastically `` i have lately heard of you from the legislature of louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man ' ' .	79.96327
mrs . child , who had once apologized for sending editor palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of henry palfrey ' s slaves escape to canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in louisiana .	115.596306
she agreed to take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send them north immediately .	111.955345
at lexington , kentucky , palfrey consulted with cassius m . clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result .	51.554
despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , palfrey ' s reception in new orleans was more than cordial .	36.488407
instead of the expected `` annoyances ' ' due to the nature of his mission , he received many calling cards and invitations from `` gentlemen of mark , on whom i had no sort of claim , & have had many more invitations than i could accept ' ' .	95.2076
he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of the `` marked attention and civility ' ' with which the new orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him .	57.831814
the memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and civil war .	88.03119
palfrey ' s autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans ' ' .	80.42161
he proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high ' ' .	59.096836
palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go north for freedom .	104.41692
the women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage .	25.53785
he had a short private talk with each adult slave .	281.15015
only one objected , but palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others .	36.32395
all the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce ' ' .	70.108284
the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account .	79.94334
william ' s threat that under no conditions would he allow `` freedom-conscious ' ' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before .	97.29034
palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience ' ' .	72.32569
from cambridge , palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves .	35.74992
in fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased .	160.08014
should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , giffen was to provide passage at once .	163.63333
when a sailing date of march , 1845 was finally established , palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters in new orleans and aboard ship .	101.528915
giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the negroes with consideration .	275.3601
palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 .	229.46051
the plantation was sold in january , 1845 , and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months ' wages .	122.72488
giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year ' s work	23.637236
the new owner at attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement .	94.922165
on march 21 , 1845 the bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans , while on the levee henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father ' s former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation .	55.16277
not all of palfrey ' s slaves were aboard the bashaw .	148.22101
giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants .	55.286057
two of these were included in palfrey ' s lot .	22.010962
giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the st . martin ' s parish police jury .	59.995308
after an initial rejection , which he attributed to a `` general excitement against abolition and emancipation ' ' , giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury , and got the permission without further delay .	50.17513
when the negroes landed at boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves .	28.379076
slavery was prohibited in massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 , which declared `` all men are born free and equal ' ' .	23.12144
nevertheless , palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at king ' s chapel to formalize the emancipation .	48.06251
an eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway , and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free .	128.33192
once the question of emancipation was settled to palfrey ' s satisfaction , he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants .	117.168465
palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a negro boy in the hopedale community , but he had better luck in his other attempts .	63.00501
mrs . child , true to her word , helped place anna and her four children with a quaker family named hathaway near canandaigua , new york .	101.81651
this group had been palfrey ' s greatest worry since anna was in bad health , and her children were too young to work for their keep .	80.80419
but certainly the new frontier has brought to washington a group more varied in background and interest .	263.54108
secretary of state dean rusk , a former rhodes scholar and mills college dean , has headed the rockefeller foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange .	102.19561
one of his initial acts in office was to appoint philip coombs of the ford foundation as the first assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs .	50.78085
( `` in the late forties and fifties ' ' , coombs has declared in defining his role , `` two strong new arms were added to reinforce united states foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance .	107.49906
as we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm , aimed at the development of people , at the fuller realization of their creative human potential , and a better understanding among them ' ' .	63.985687
many of the new appointees are art collectors .	4.3859496
ambassador-at-large averell harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include renoir , cezanne , gauguin , van gogh , toulouse-lautrec , degas , matisse , picasso , and walt kuhn .	15.758006
the director of the peace corps , r . sargent shriver , jr . , a kennedy brother-in-law , collects heavily among the moderns , including kenzo okada and josef albers .	19.60585
secretary of the treasury douglas dillon owns a prize monet , femmes dans un jardin .	19.553188
secretary of defense robert mcnamara , former president of the ford motor company , comes from a generation different from that of eisenhower ' s own first secretary of defense , charles wilson , who had been head of general motors .	54.38026
unlike wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism .	19.332617
an inveterate reader of books , he chose while working in detroit to live in the university community of ann arbor , almost forty miles away .	72.509056
he selected as comptroller of defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former rhodes scholar , charles hitch , who is author of a study on the economics of defense in the nuclear age .	42.042393
one of the president ' s special assistants , the harvard dean mcgeorge bundy , was co-author with henry l . stimson of the latter ' s classic memoir , on active service .	36.649277
another , arthur m . schlesinger , jr . , has won a pulitzer prize in history	10.964934
his wife , marion , is a portrait painter .	7.494045
the press secretary , pierre salinger , was a child prodigy as a pianist .	45.337524
( `` it is always of sorrow to me when i find people who neither know nor understand music ' ' , he declared not long ago in proposing that white house prizes be awarded for music and art .	102.66631
) mrs . arthur goldberg , wife of the secretary of labor , paints professionally and helps sponsor the associated artists ' gallery in the district of columbia .	68.39827
( `` artists are always at a new frontier ' ' , she claims .	35.170807
`` in fact , the search is almost more important than the find ' ' .	17.840853
) mrs . henry labouisse , wife of the new director of the foreign aid program , is the writer and lecturer eve curie .	34.364567
at last count , sixteen former rhodes scholars ( see box on page 13 ) had been appointed to the administration , second in number only to its harvard graduates .	124.7924
besides schlesinger , the justice department ' s information director , edwin guthman , has won a pulitzer prize ( for national reporting ) .	40.400208
postmaster general j . edward day , who must deal with matters of postal censorship , is himself author of a novel , bartholf street , albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense .	127.30536
william walton , a writer-turned-painter , has been a long-time friend of the president .	24.954485
they arrived in washington about the same time during the early postwar years kennedy as the young congressman from massachusetts	81.14765
walton , after a wartime stint with time-life , to become bureau chief for the new republic .	122.12931
both lived in georgetown , were unattached , and shared an active social life .	116.781364
walton , who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital ' s leading semi-abstract painters , vows that he and kennedy never once discussed art in those days .	129.19826
during last year ' s campaign , kennedy asked walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him .	99.85681
walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important new york city .	62.296753
walton , who served as a correspondent with general james gavin ' s paratroopers during the invasion of france , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy .	57.458424
he provoked outraged editorials when , after a post-inaugural inspection of the white house with mrs . kennedy , he remarked to reporters , `` we just cased the joint to see what was there ' ' .	41.566177
already the president and the first lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the white house to the renovation of lafayette square .	40.775066
a man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture .	43.611786
a more official representative is the secretary of the interior .	7.507702
udall , who comes from one of the mormon first-families of arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight .	44.597015
but even while sparring furiously with republican politicians , he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments .	92.15292
his private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as c . p . snow , arnold toynbee , and aaron copland .	84.105675
udall argues that interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves .	32.154823
after promoting frost ' s appearance at the inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of cabinet members , members of congress , and other washington notables gathered in the state department auditorium .	68.88681
the event was so successful that the interior secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the administration .	68.60618
his ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response .	420.05643
one tempest was stirred up last march when udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of william jennings bryan , sculpted by the late gutzon borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan ' ' to salem , illinois , bryan ' s birthplace .	38.570362
spokesmen for the nation ' s tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form .	100.38182
they dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which `` dot the washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans ' ' .	100.28293
hoping to cut down on such works , udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized .	82.04318
he is not likely to win this battle easily .	239.5533
in the case of the borglum statue an interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the secretary had no desire to `` hustle ' ' it out of washington .	46.415863
the last congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to taras shevchenko , the ukrainian poet laureate	34.650692
active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first roosevelt on theodore roosevelt island in the potomac , and tr . ' s own living children , who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary .	58.299957
the hotly debated plan for the capital ' s franklin d . roosevelt memorial , a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics , `` instant stonehenge ' ' ) , is another of udall ' s headaches , since as supervisor of the national parks commission he will share in the responsibility for building it .	61.763435
`` washington ' ' , president kennedy has been heard to remark ironically , `` is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm ' ' .	66.18677
there have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the white house .	79.932434
one of mrs . kennedy ' s initial concerns as first lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine .	76.82824
ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by president thomas jefferson , the white house has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic .	130.02786
mrs . kennedy shows a determination to change all this .	88.72915
not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the british ship h . m . s . resolute and presented to president hayes by queen victoria .	69.35533
it now serves the president in his oval office .	47.432552
later , browsing in an old issue of the gazette des beaux-arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by president james monroe .	51.749226
with its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval blue room on the first floor of the white house .	52.984444
but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which mrs . kennedy feels is the proper period for the white house ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms .	160.48979
the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee for the white house , to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them .	33.250706
her effort to put the home of living presidents on the same basis as mount vernon and monticello recognizes no party lines .	126.69142
by rough estimate her committee , headed by henry francis du pont , contains three times as many republicans as democrats .	88.8899
the press releases emanating from the white house give a clue to the activity within .	150.45065
a valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of benjamin franklin by jean-honore fragonard has been donated by the art dealer georges wildenstein and now hangs in the blue room .	43.092854
the american institute of interior designers is redecorating the white house library .	10.072306
secretary and mrs . dillon have contributed enough pieces of empire furniture , including dolley madison ' s own sofa , to furnish a room in that style .	46.283344
and part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware , bequeathed to the white house by the late mrs . margaret thompson biddle , has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the state dining room .	41.31223
woman ' s place is in the home man must attend to matters of the yard .	144.80742
one of the vexatious problems to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just across pennsylvania avenue from the white house .	88.32383
congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking lafayette square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality ' ' of government office buildings .	58.946323
while a senator , kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the belasco theater , as well as the dolley madison and the benjamin taylor houses , all scheduled for razing .	49.409073
what to do about it now that he was president ? ?	85.32113
only a few days after moving into the white house .	12.444238
kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square .	2.9663641
then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem to him , with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn ' t pile unnecessary burdens on the president .	74.55455
one of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged court of claims , diagonally across the street from the white house .	52.031994
but judge marvin jones , senior member of the court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk to work .	71.86051
more importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of sam rayburn , speaker of the house .	23.600536
there were aesthetic problems as well as political .	145.03448
on delving deeper , walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified as `` early nondescript ' ' .	40.590572
the old belasco theater , over which many people had grown sentimental , was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a uso center .	120.804634
the dolley madison house , walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving .	241.11382
`` the attempt to save the square ' s historic value ' ' , he declares , `` came half a century too late ' ' .	38.148754
surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful .	56.938225
the dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did .	31.394968
but his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures .	75.85116
he is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be .	51.04922
he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart .	83.162964
the men ' s shops on hanover ' s main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven .	59.205963
and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend , toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia .	88.3072
but there has always been an outdoor air to dartmouth .	282.5387
the would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .	662.36597
no one here pokes fun at manly virtues .	6.8798656
and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league .	83.16134
thus , when dartmouth ' s winter carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o ' -shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a smith girl .	91.5524
president dickey ' s golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .	55.18358
this carefree disdain for `` side ' ' cropped up again in the same television broadcast .	69.479095
dean thaddeus seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival .	20.436628
she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .	153.32552
dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .	2.4778016
for example , groups regularly canoe down the connecticut river .	86.90856
this is in honor of john ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days .	110.35621
and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .	3.5529666
they are hailed by the nation ' s press , and smith girls throng the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses .	74.87069
dartmouth ' s favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .	47.87155
since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the united states , the students have stopped regarding the olympic ski team as another name for their own .	84.13752
yet dartmouth still is the dominant member of the intercollegiate ski union , which includes the winter sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country .	31.156027
dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door .	76.52956
they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to oak hill , where there ' s a lift .	58.456566
the dartmouth skiway , at holt ' s ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the east , ranging from novice to expert .	49.219368
forty miles farther north is mount moosilauke , dartmouth ' s own mountain .	34.029057
here , at the ravine lodge , president dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the dartmouth outing club to life on the trails .	87.55458
the lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room .	74.29687
the outing club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through hanover to the college grant -- 27 , 000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country .	53.254932
the cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips .	46.807705
the club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing .	29.15595
under the auspices of the outing club , dartmouth also has the mountaineering club , which takes on tough climbs like mount mckinley , and bait & bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a woodman ' s team , which competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like .	71.93494
there is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon .	126.09338
city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp .	94.0483
and on the summit of mount washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas `` because it is there ' ' .	62.088184
there is much to be said for such a college -- and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly .	93.638405
their affection for their college home has even caused president dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty ' ' as something rather specially hanoverian .	161.1535
probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the supreme court of the united states .	15.580707
early in the nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university .	181.67822
it fixed on dartmouth college , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered .	386.2325
the legislators decided to `` liberate ' ' dartmouth and entered into a tug-o ' -war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel .	66.443214
for a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body .	65.158806
the struggle was resolved in 1819 in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history .	36.209484
in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters .	70.78728
a lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for dartmouth daniel webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea .	146.67606
in an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly tears , as uncle dan ' l reached his thundering climax	74.558075
`` it is , sir , as i have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it .	66.31461
dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to webster ' s eloquence .	94.371025
this is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the ivy group .	68.90729
eleazar wheelock , a presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor .	98.432144
eleazar , pausing on the hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first college hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences	147.89265
and also of english youth and any others ' ' .	4.4399524
it was a hardy undertaking , and wheelock ' s was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness ' ' .	34.49005
a road had to be hacked through trackless forests between hanover and portsmouth to permit governor wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first dartmouth commencement in 1771 .	68.87805
the governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college .	31.965672
the exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings .	398.98737
a student orator `` produced tears from a great number of the learned ' ' even before the punch was served .	80.52621
then from the branches of a near-by tree an indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the english language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue .	50.205944
governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached .	27.782825
the cook got drunk , and president wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself .	69.95464
future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace .	76.04129
by the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the big three , columbia , and penn were populous centers of learning , dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine .	165.52942
the dormitories , including the beloved dartmouth hall , could barely house two hundred students in spartan fashion .	187.99788
then in 1893 dr . william jewett tucker became president and the college ' s great awakening began .	69.49779
he transformed dartmouth from a small new hampshire institution into a national college .	115.06555
by 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1 , 107 .	7.673544
and at his last commencement , in that year , dr . tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college .	47.88805
the presidents of cornell , wisconsin , c . c . n . y . , bowdoin , vermont , brown , columbia , princeton , yale , and harvard and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there .	20.335152
dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .	52.626667
but it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside new england .	89.80414
over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class .	74.28195
only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation .	60.665504
about two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .	43.300644
it is still a college only and not a university	119.12925
it is , in fact , the only college in the ivy group .	89.14837
however , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the dartmouth medical school ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the thayer school of engineering , and the amos tuck school of business administration .	73.34187
all three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .	126.16604
all three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study .	150.10182
students of the college who are candidates for the a . b . degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year .	75.65069
the thayer school offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a b . s . in engineering .	51.13054
so dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the ivy group .	28.558014
it is still , however , the junior member of the league , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do .	81.02021
it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other ivies have enjoyed .	115.27347
however much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition .	165.66422
it has come on with a rush in more significant areas .	75.63197
today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .	202.20409
but dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy .	94.77847
president emeritus hopkins once proposed to corral an `` aristocracy of brains ' ' in hanover .	32.888203
the person who left the buggy there has never been identified .	22.54629
it was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside .	57.851063
there are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against emma .	86.24252
she didn ' t like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage .	102.3037
she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed .	119.5881
she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels .	155.87117
if she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her .	75.794395
if police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect .	86.9043
uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate popular suspect .	37.270256
his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer .	96.493645
lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day .	48.158524
it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her uncle morse .	64.64736
at that time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s . phillips .	66.43349
a few years ago , not too long before his death , phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders .	71.31635
he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from lizzie .	122.704575
it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door .	286.88748
the new bedford standard-times has reported knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what borden said during his conversation with morse , he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	48.199287
notice , knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of lizzie borden .	28.204842
he said he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	2.139012
it is known that morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at westport , a town not far from fall river .	120.4541
they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters .	102.13934
fall river police did go to westport to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men .	163.26755
morse ' s alibi was not as solid as it seemed .	40.342945
he said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11 20 streetcar .	43.869923
the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner .	99.0518
if this woman had delayed until after 11 20 to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days .	101.28367
it is possible that morse told the woman it was 11 20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time .	91.09534
police did make an attempt to check on morse ' s alibi .	13.886844
they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember morse as a passenger .	45.24866
questioned further , morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him .	35.790825
the conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so morse ' s statement really proved nothing .	193.10234
we do know that morse left the house before nine o ' clock .	28.786957
bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door .	106.04041
morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door .	28.747238
from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away .	36.677616
he met nobody he knew on this walk .	4.448905
there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs . borden was killed .	77.75378
morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , mrs . borden told the servant , `` bridget , i want you to wash these windows today ' ' .	32.607613
bridget ' s testimony was in direct contradiction .	6.944621
she said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs . borden told her to wash the windows .	48.95486
this was long after morse had left the house .	14.542642
morse ' s knowledge of what mrs . borden told bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there .	98.77961
he knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone .	65.502815
and despite knowlton ' s attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true .	67.53014
the screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back .	51.414055
it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows .	524.5583
morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied .	54.211575
mrs . borden would not have been alarmed if she saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .	39.19787
he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm .	74.65049
mrs . borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out .	102.495155
he could have left for weybosset street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar .	135.42296
if he took an earlier streetcar than the 11 20 on his return , he could have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr . borden came home .	80.66283
with lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and bridget upstairs in her attic room , he would have had free and easy access to the house .	59.089226
with the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood .	121.160225
his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding the side door , was odd .	66.61303
there was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them .	77.177605
and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed .	262.44952
there was no financial gain for morse in the murders .	21.072405
on the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying .	28.19141
the time would have been shortly after the murder of mrs . borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior .	59.54781
he said he had promised mrs . borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden house .	41.719273
what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? ?	46.28009
`` the police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr . morse as in possession of guilty knowledge .	154.37274
indeed , it was probably to mr . morse ' s advantage to have mr . and mrs . borden alive .	25.04115
both he and bridget were exonerated by lizzie herself ' ' .	10.85113
that was his complete discussion of bridget sullivan as a possible suspect .	30.510664
although pearson disbelieved almost everything lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about bridget as the whole truth .	171.62459
he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl .	127.19099
the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but lizzie ' s expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of assistant marshal fleet .	45.78906
this officer had asked lizzie if she suspected her uncle morse , and she replied she didn ' t think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them .	39.160427
fleet asked the same question about bridget , and lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her room before her father ' s murder and came down when she called her .	49.696007
lizzie , actually , never named any suspect .	4.8413677
she told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner .	83.90139
and , much as she detested hiram harrington , she also did not accuse him .	40.05542
at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father .	125.653725
she replied , `` i know of one man that has not been friendly with him .	30.950466
they have not been friendly for years ' ' .	1.4467124
asked who this was , she named harrington .	16.791235
the press reported the same facts in using harrington ' s interview , but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the killer .	54.528915
when i interviewed kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the borden yard , i asked if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders .	101.75463
he said he had not heard of anybody else .	5.3563175
`` how about bridget sullivan ' ' ? ?	1.1149262
`` oh , she was just the maid there ' ' , he replied , waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was .	104.25224
kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders .	44.07374
everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders lizzie borden and bridget sullivan .	48.903336
all the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers .	109.93672
true , it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations .	101.363
the actions of bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence .	183.58888
there are also other factors that require closer examination .	82.354225
the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle ' ' of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut .	99.55667
the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of lizzie .	237.90996
if bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been lizzie borden .	72.39221
bridget was born in ireland , one of fourteen children .	68.98378
she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time .	51.265755
she worked as a domestic , first in newport for a year , and then in south bethlehem , pennsylvania , for another year .	52.568848
she finally settled in fall river and , after being employed for a time by a mrs . reed , was hired by the bordens .	49.68764
i have previously described how , during the week of the murder , bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes .	67.4891
her father , james upton , was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port .	88.23867
a gentleman of the old school , mr . upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted christian .	103.42196
the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects .	45.72172
her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests .	111.79573
there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood had an unusual mind .	133.00111
she possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty .	47.873707
when she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited .	62.406555
she named 48 items , and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write ' ' .	52.0508
an essay on `` freedom ' ' written at 10 years of age quoted the declaration of independence , the freedom given to slaves in canada , and the views of george washington .	57.74862
lucy upton was graduated from the salem high school when few colleges , only oberlin and elmira , were open to women	96.32653
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .	31.996094
a picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , albert s . flint , friend of her brother winslow , and later , like winslow , a noted astronomer .	28.382904
he recalled lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys ' study hall to join the class in greek in the little recitation room beyond ' ' .	94.19569
the study of greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and lucy upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .	82.38278
the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this .	105.850464
with four younger children at home , lucy stepped into her mother ' s role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father ' s comfort and stay until he died in 1879 .	39.530357
but even so lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits .	46.181732
when her brother winslow became a student at brown university in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under professor diman `` what is prof . diman ' s definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ? ?	81.101654
do you think i might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you .	141.97064
' ' and that she proceeded to do .	18.129156
many years later ( on august 3 , 1915 ) , lucy upton wrote winslow ' s daughter soon to be graduated from smith college `` while i love botany which , after dabbling in for years , i studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school , it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing .	88.861725
whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study .	95.41835
she read maitland ' s dark ages , `` which i enjoyed very much ' '	36.918293
la croix on the customs of the middle ages , 16 chapters of bryce `` and liked it more and more ' '	84.00379
she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone .	73.64711
lucy ' s correspondence with brother winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies .	204.57649
also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately ' ' .	51.942825
who won is not revealed , but winslow ' s daughter eleanor says they got up to 1 , 212 words .	77.1435
winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him .	55.647747
at different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist .	131.02731
and it was lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music at spelman college .	65.887344
winslow upton after graduation from brown university and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the harvard observatory .	68.61577
for three years he was connected with the u . s . naval observatory and with the u . s . signal corps	15.340193
and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at brown university .	26.203625
the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to colorado , virginia , and california as well as to the south pacific and to russia .	47.801334
after her father ' s death , lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington , d . c . .	23.687727
`` their house ' ' , writes albert s . flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home ' ' .	57.14843
lucy was a lively part of the household .	20.116621
moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor .	269.03192
winslow , as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister ' ' .	42.702785
there is reason to suppose that lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother ' s death occurred just as she was about to enter college .	76.500626
as a matter of fact , albert s . flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings ' ' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country ' ' .	83.28194
while in washington , d . c . , lucy upton held positions in the u . s . census office , and in the pension bureau .	42.33959
they were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to germany with her brother winslow and his family while he was there on study .	76.70583
after the months in europe , she returned to boston and became active in church and community life .	64.3792
what was called an `` accidental meeting ' ' with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman .	74.201775
after correspondence with miss packard and to the joy of miss packard and miss giles , she came to atlanta , in the fall of 1888 , to help wherever needed , although there was then no money available to pay her a salary .	52.53484
she served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance .	381.30032
her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students	126.25288
of her `` great power of discernment ' '	1.0052774
of `` her exquisiteness of dress ' ' , `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers ' '	36.756824
her great love of flowers and plants and birds	170.36948
she drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world	45.41998
and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well .	40.78332
many a student was able to remain at spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help .	102.41201
under miss upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption .	208.30453
after all , she had come to spelman seminary in 1888 , and had been since 1891 except for one year , associate principal or dean .	91.39155
she had taught classes in botany , astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ) , geometry , and psychology .	57.434784
miss upton and miss packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common .	70.74526
and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and christian zeal .	144.32083
both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding .	8.837318
in 1890 when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss packard , it was miss upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability ' ' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end ' ' .	59.911236
so strenuous it was physically , with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both miss packard and miss upton .	77.34247
at the fifteenth anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted , miss upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future as a college of first rank , with expanding and unlimited horizons .	147.1358
when dr . wallace buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the science building named for him , he wrote miss tapley ( april 7 , 1923 ) `` if you had asked me , i think i would have suggested that you name the building for miss upton .	95.22068
her services to the school for many years were of a very high character , and i have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her ' ' .	43.96
such were the qualities of the acting-president of the seminary after the death of miss giles .	34.586105
at the meeting of the board of trustees , on march 3 , 1910 , miss upton presented the annual report of the president .	29.817404
she noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence	826.6966
that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired	216.07181
and that the year ' s work had gone forward smoothly .	77.1293
she urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .	29.143126
the raising of the $25 , 000 improvement fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration ' ' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to miss giles .	129.81339
with the fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid	48.557762
and ground had been broken for the superintendent ' s home .	6.9021235
miss upton spoke gratefully of the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise the fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .	85.332886
she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results .	251.23317
two bequests were recorded one of $200 under the will of mrs . harriet a . copp of los angeles	53.92857
and one of $2 , 000 under the will of miss celia l . brett of hamilton , new york , a friend from the early days .	57.274437
miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss giles was `` the sorest grief ' ' the seminary had ever been called upon to bear .	33.65477
the daughters of spelman , she said , had never known or thought of spelman without her .	241.85109
the removal of miss packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow , but they still had miss giles .	115.68905
`` yet spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come ' ' .	44.085026
miss mary jane packard , sophia ' s half-sister , became ill in march , 1910	37.279198
and when school closed , she was unable to travel to massachusetts .	31.929491
before coming on a visit to spelman in 1885 , miss mary had been a successful teacher in worcester , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period .	70.85627
she helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping .	63.383755
soon the office work claimed all her time .	9.024656
she was closely associated with the founders in all their trials and hardships .	117.793236
quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary .	120.87494
miss giles always used to refer to her as `` sister ' ' .	13.161479
she served as secretary in the seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping .	33.52882
the books of the school hold a memorial to her	56.236435
and so do the hearts of students and of teachers .	68.66797
mary j . packard , states a messenger editorial , was `` efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her master .	40.337894
with infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer .	95.57915
in a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .	168.00117
in those vocational programs organized with smith-hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other .	52.532974
in these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 .	61.854683
the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school .	68.83428
these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work .	32.034756
formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation .	69.02261
the `` diversified occupations ' ' program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers .	61.890114
the `` distributive education ' ' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields .	56.820786
in both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half .	83.88827
in a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation .	90.53373
adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth .	81.24711
in general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next .	91.905075
if the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete .	111.32484
when there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well .	195.47409
indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .	93.82344
statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one .	57.89163
i make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .	63.69391
he may or may not be `` better off ' ' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school .	65.33945
but in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .	195.73534
in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , i shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found .	36.41409
in the negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation .	52.91071
high motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .	114.4499
undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the negro schools .	79.16067
however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual .	41.090096
and the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .	158.55856
this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern universities .	36.24751
quite the contrary , as i can testify from personal experience as a former university president .	90.73655
the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic careers .	115.584114
i believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized .	110.142136
here again we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated as negroes in the press .	92.96878
how can the vicious circle be broken ? ?	1.0312023
this is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both negro and white , should devote far more attention .	92.90178
it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south .	90.908226
i should like to underline four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education .	43.460407
first and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation .	100.228386
second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student ' s time in those years	51.1545
however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier .	107.93292
third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work	64.0871
they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time .	48.846912
fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .	14.387093
this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .	77.58086
vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore ' ' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .	136.97433
those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .	88.93446
i have been using the word `` vocational ' ' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used .	78.00336
i intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .	132.44817
these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic ' ' .	59.987873
practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill .	41.07842
they are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school .	45.03731
to be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .	132.81999
similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school .	81.59105
of course , it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill .	67.71781
so , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics .	36.35266
in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained .	73.49374
in spite of the shading of one type of course into another , i believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses .	58.339973
perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule .	77.832855
today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school .	75.559845
most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools .	50.663944
in this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts .	65.25205
the neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school .	48.710136
indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs .	55.593216
he prefers to designate such schools as `` general ' ' high schools .	27.920494
the suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs .	43.96936
the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .	11.170176
therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report .	69.75076
the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .	35.42684
by and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system .	59.004223
it is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .	122.96258
one has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` i want to be a plumber ' ' , and then , by doing good work , find a job .	42.987404
it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation .	88.06931
two stories will illustrate what i have in mind .	20.128145
one vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .	86.24051
in the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can ' t get in .	92.48294
in a far distant part of the united states , i was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work .	66.10359
`` what does he have in mind to do when he graduates ' ' ? ?	20.197657
`` oh , he ' ll be a plumber ' ' , came the answer .	17.336155
`` but isn ' t it almost impossible to get into the union ' ' ? ?	14.773402
`` he ' ll have no difficulty ' ' , i was told .	11.222475
`` he has very good connections ' ' .	2.6475496
in my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .	163.52927
ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest .	57.48824
an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the dunbar vocational high school in chicago .	32.151043
located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students .	90.01018
hardly a window has been broken since dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) .	112.57234
i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were negroes .	138.33925
they were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics .	30.729097
the physical facilities at dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils .	51.523552
the soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world .	28.789318
in the united states , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil .	37.70947
the residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds .	54.951927
soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the orient .	51.85109
american chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of indonesia .	78.16578
soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk ' ' , and curd can be bought in the united states .	16.727365
peanuts are the world ' s second most important legume .	24.191723
we produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed .	89.091125
blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off .	67.67833
cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of asia and africa .	38.351418
in western europe and north america , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed .	54.790127
rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats .	19.48016
people depend less on seeds for foods in australia , new zealand , and argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high .	54.91685
feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world ' s cereal crop in 1957-1958 .	34.638535
most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry .	18.551897
about 90 percent of the corn used in the united states is fed to animals .	54.14829
the rest is used for human food and industrial products .	22.268251
more than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock .	71.48611
more than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the united states .	18.235264
the efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the united states since the 1930 ' s and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil .	43.15035
the demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops .	66.02179
seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position .	83.060356
chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax , castor , tung ( nuts from the china wood-oil tree ) , perilla ( from an oriental mint ) , and oiticica ( from a brazilian tree ) .	25.72706
oils , or liquid fats , from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal .	28.264454
these oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances .	69.5764
the artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages .	63.87366
one of the finest of artists ' oils comes from poppy seeds .	71.86901

some are used in paints along with drying oils .	18.880249
palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin .	54.405224
castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine .	66.77118
this nondrying oil , however , is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant , as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment , and as a source of chemicals to make plastics .	52.765923
almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances .	88.73546
it is still used in drugs and cosmetics , but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds .	48.963287
liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives .	75.1035
sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins .	33.19968
solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree , the shea tree , and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries .	22.999432
seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world .	32.992004
corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the united states , canada , and australia .	19.285582
in other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region , starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch .	72.19996
starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations .	30.121262
gums were extracted from quince , psyllium ( fleawort ) , flax , and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times .	15.35715
today the yearly import into the united states of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds	33.08248
of psyllium seed , more than 2 . 6 million .	13.449369
the discovery during the second world war that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western asia and initiated it in the united states .	62.2069
water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents .	40.4051
guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream .	5.81273
quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions .	6.864506
once regarded as an agricultural nuisance , psyllium was sold in the 1930 ' s as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands .	40.19605
locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper .	37.24856
the seeds of hard , fibrous , stony fruits , called nuts , provide highly concentrated foods , oils , and other materials of value .	35.186115
most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick , adherent , brown covering -- the seedcoat .	98.47406
the kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily .	11.303643
almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein .	82.64238
the world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds , brazil nuts , filberts , and the english walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually .	24.600046
coconuts , the fruit of the coconut palm , have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in south pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets .	119.0435
the oil palm of west africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit .	44.02212
world production of copra , the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut , was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 .	21.81839
exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons , about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil .	70.487335
other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg	6.221605
the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins	69.15165
the marking nut , used for ink and varnish	12.02898
and the sweet-smelling cumara nut , which is suited for perfumes .	31.162848
a forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm .	158.96144

victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry .	162.98341
handmade christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year .	23.53609
tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components .	43.49172
although science has given us more effective materials , preparations from anise , castorbean , colchicum , nux vomica , mustard , fennel , and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments .	26.42432
flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons .	102.1466
peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection .	45.896194
still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible .	68.268326
the common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group .	197.5076
each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported .	29.323362
single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica .	15.2796
less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom .	33.528988
white pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit .	59.63829

the japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain .	20.012955
arrack is distilled from fermented rice in india .	6.129888
beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage .	54.666218
beer was brewed by the babylonians and egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago .	37.29988
brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley .	13.204542
distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol .	36.871746
seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the united states .	16.312387
the farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year .	50.367344
cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised .	100.72176
the economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater , because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn , oats , barley , and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed , cottonseed , and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry , meat , and dairy products .	32.44166
seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock .	9.125961
hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed .	83.39754
seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed .	17.262295
more than 11 thousand business establishments in the united states were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 .	24.147324
the value of products from these industries was 15 . 8 billion dollars , of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes .	91.03559
not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products .	51.7113
cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the american diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry .	17.426838
to hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin ' ' ' ' em .	30.608406
to keep ' em scattered somewhat and yet herd ' em was called `` loose herdin ' ' ' .	25.959242
to hold ' em in a compact mass was `` close herdin ' ' ' .	24.296392
cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted .	77.41749
that became their `` home range ' ' .	5.28637
yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin ' grass and water .	65.8332
these became `` strays ' ' , the term bein ' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses ' ' , not merely `` strays ' ' .	49.02747
cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over .	38.724705
you had to go with ' em or wait till the storm was over , and follow .	226.10725
such marchin ' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift ' ' , or `` winter drift ' ' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range .	31.817865
the cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals .	41.086063
the single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays ' '	20.996859
but when a large number were `` bunched up ' ' or `` banded up ' ' , and marched away from their home range , as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a `` drift ' ' .	27.925402
drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede .	55.619705
drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had ' nough sense to avoid ' em , and to find shelter for ' emselves .	94.07198
the wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards , and sometimes droughts , over a wide range of territory was called a `` die-up ' ' .	21.920204
followin ' such an event there was usually a harvest of `` fallen hides ' ' , and the ranchers needed skinnin ' knives instead of brandin ' irons .	21.362455
cattle were said to be `` potted ' ' when `` blizzard choked ' ' , that is , caught in a corner or a draw , or against a `` drift fence ' ' durin ' a storm .	39.419563
cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill ' ' .	28.534857
when cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up ' ' .	43.03511
this term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin ' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` he arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm ' ' .	43.244633
cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature ' em into prime beef were said to be `` double wintered ' ' .	53.973835
cattle brought into a range from a distance were called `` immigrants ' ' .	51.726048
them new to the country were referred to as `` pilgrims ' ' .	12.5947
this word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot .	61.53664
hereford cattle were often called `` white faces ' ' , or `` open-face cattle ' ' , and the old-time cowman gave the name of `` hothouse stock ' ' to them newly introduced cattle .	26.615751
because holstein cattle weren ' t a beef breed , they were rarely seen on a ranch , though one might be found now and then for the milk supply .	65.58239
the cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies ' ' .	2.999866
a `` cattaloe ' ' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle .	37.76915
`` dry stock ' ' denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin ' no milk .	60.36264
a `` wet herd ' ' was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows , while `` wet stuff ' ' referred to cows givin ' milk .	43.48665
the cowboy ' s humorous name for a cow givin ' milk was a `` milk pitcher ' ' .	15.087153
cows givin ' no milk were knowed as `` strippers ' ' .	7.0539684
the terminology of the range , in speakin ' of `` dry stock ' ' and `` wet stock ' ' , was confusin ' to the tenderfoot .	37.644054
the most common reference to `` wet stock ' ' was with the meanin ' that such animals had been smuggled across the rio grande after bein ' stolen from their rightful owners .	57.99933
the term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals .	596.1518
`` mixed herd ' ' meant a herd of mixed sexes , while a `` straight steer herd ' ' was one composed entirely of steers , and when the cowman spoke of `` mixed cattle ' ' , he meant cattle of various grades , ages , and sexes .	46.115597
in the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass , this was spoken of as `` turn-out time ' ' , or `` put to grass ' ' .	38.82654
`` shootin ' ' em out ' ' was gettin ' cattle out of a corral onto the range .	38.70956
when a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin ' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin ' ' ' .	52.185833
to stir cattle up and get ' em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle ' ' , and the act was called `` ginnin ' ' em ' round ' ' , or `` chousin ' ' em ' ' .	18.705778
after a roundup the pushin ' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called `` throwin ' over ' ' .	50.78291
a cow rose from the ground rear end first .	91.03971
by the time her hindquarters were in a standin ' position , her knees were on the ground in a prayin ' attitude .	72.71021
it was when she was in this position that the name `` prayin ' cow ' ' was suggested to the cowboy .	80.28222
they were said to be `` on their heads ' ' when grazin ' .	51.49909
`` on the hoof ' ' was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin ' to cattle travelin ' by trail under their own power as against goin ' by rail .	101.21873
shippin ' cattle by train was called a `` stock run ' ' .	11.985369
a general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers ' ' .	2.6581836
when a cowboy spoke of `` dustin ' ' ' a cow , he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes .	37.245518
the cow , unlike a bull or steer , kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin ' , and a cow `` on the prod ' ' or `` on the peck ' ' was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges .	62.19774
the injun ' s name for beef was `` wohaw ' ' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the injun on the trails .	38.412216
the first cattle the injuns saw under the white man ' s control were the ox teams of the early freighters .	88.51051
listenin ' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted `` whoa ' ' , `` haw ' ' , and `` gee ' ' , they thought them words the names of the animals , and began callin ' cattle `` wohaws ' ' .	20.254044
rarely did a trail herd pass through the injun country on its march north that it wasn ' t stopped to receive demand for `` wohaw ' ' .	71.63266
`` tailin ' ' ' was the throwin ' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope .	47.935043
any animal could when travelin ' fast , be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin ' the brute , seizin ' its tail , and givin ' the latter a pull to one side .	110.90161
this throwed the animal off balance , and over it ' d crash onto its head and shoulders .	196.50339
though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin ' results , many men assured success through a turn of the tail ' bout the saddle horn , supplemented sometimes , in the case of cattle , by a downward heave of the rider ' s leg upon the strainin ' tail .	92.62435
such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough `` tailin ' ' ' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed ' im that he ' d behave for the rest of the day .	46.14081
it required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin ' rider .	107.00345
when cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was ' round .	101.152824
when the cowboy used the word `` tailin ' s ' ' , he meant stragglers .	14.614974
`` bull tailin ' ' ' was a game once pop ' lar with the mexican cowboys of texas .	119.49803
from a pen of wild bulls one would be released , and with much yellin ' a cowhand ' d take after ' im .	64.09428
seizin ' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin ' the bull off balance , and `` bustin ' ' ' ' im with terrific force .	54.68705
rammin ' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold ' im down was called `` peggin ' ' ' .	38.400826
colors of cattle came in for their special names .	36.58477
an animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a `` brindle ' ' or `` brockle ' ' .	15.362424
a `` lineback ' ' was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin ' down its back , while a `` lobo stripe ' ' was the white , yeller , or brown stripe runnin ' down the back , from neck to tail , a characteristic of many spanish cattle .	55.853134
a `` mealynose ' ' was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter ' n the rest of its body ' round the eyes , face , and nose .	76.33377
such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed ' ' .	3.858873
`` sabinas ' ' was a spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin ' .	63.499706
the northern cowboy called all the red mexican cattle which went up the trail `` sonora reds ' ' , while they called all cattle drove up from mexico `` yaks ' ' , because they came from the yaqui injun country , or gave ' em the name of `` mexican buckskins ' ' .	33.14295
near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin ' on the sides and belly , were called `` zorrillas ' ' .	57.34546
this word was from the spanish , meanin ' `` polecat ' ' .	11.523607
`` yeller bellies ' ' were cattle of mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color .	66.67674
an animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a `` marker ' ' .	68.90002
such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler .	28.11854
countin ' each grazin ' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin ' it back so that it didn ' t mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count ' ' .	35.66284
the countin ' of cattle in a pasture without throwin ' ' em together for the purpose was called a `` pasture count ' ' .	39.027493
the counters rode through the pasture countin ' each bunch of grazin ' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn ' t get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead .	36.96797
this method of countin ' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd .	67.204285
them notes and mortgages were spoken of as `` cattle paper ' ' .	37.571407
a `` book count ' ' was the sellin ' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller .	72.31952
this led to the famous sayin ' in the northwest of the `` books won ' t freeze ' ' .	16.405521
this became a common byword durin ' the boom days when eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests .	206.02837
the origin of this sayin ' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of luke murrin .	18.750748
his saloon was a meetin ' place for influential wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin ' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin ' long faces , he said , `` cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won ' t freeze ' ' .	49.124165
in this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin ' custom of buyin ' by book count , and created a sayin ' which has survived through the years .	92.06688
`` range delivery ' ' meant that the buyer , after examinin ' the seller ' s ranch records and considerin ' his rep ' tation for truthfulness , paid for what the seller claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it .	113.44617
when a cowhand said that a man had `` good cow sense ' ' , he meant to pay ' im a high compliment .	36.99326
no matter by what name cattle were called , there was no denyin ' that they not only saved texas from financial ruin , but went far toward redeemin ' from a wilderness vast territories of the northwest .	102.22213
the first use of the word `` rustler ' ' was as a synonym for `` hustler ' ' , becomin ' an established term for any person who was active , pushin ' , and bustlin ' in any enterprise .	60.917004
again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler , and when the order was given to go out and `` rustle the hosses ' ' , it meant for ' im to go out and herd ' em in .	54.454617
eventually herdin ' the hosses was spoken of as `` hoss rustlin ' ' ' , and the wrangler was called the `` hoss rustler ' ' .	16.458763
later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief , startin ' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to `` get out and rustle a few mavericks ' ' .	42.466362
it was john who found the lion tracks .	12.371561
he found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and jones knew it was a hot trail .	89.75367
he stifled the comanche yell and let john lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain .	86.51474
this mountain was known as the black reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass .	76.12277
on the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly .	69.73181
kearton and ulyate had started the day together while jones followed the dogs , and means and loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the reef and pointed .	100.32607
`` that ' s the colonel ' ' , he said , `` but i can ' t see the dogs ' ' .	7.685515
as they watched , jones rode straight for the reef .	26.360151
then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him .	31.75912
the dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ?	80.460075
the pack had made a bend to the north , swinging back toward the reef , and kearton and ulyate could hear them faintly .	29.906761
kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring loveless and means and the rest of the party .	82.06622
`` not yet ' ' , cautioned ulyate .	6.0954843
jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern toe of the reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , old john with his grand canyon voice outstanding above the others .	103.3218
there was sounder , too , also a veteran of the north rim , and rastus and the rake from a pack of english fox-hounds , and a collie from a london pound , and simba , a terrier .	56.783325
a motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty .	315.3474
jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on .	71.85109
ulyate said , and kearton touched a match to the pile of grass , blew on it and flame licked out .	56.00338
he threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose .	97.42181
`` that will fetch the gang and tell the colonel where we are ' ' .	40.189056
then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying .	14.151725
kearton and ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound .	48.919624
it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away .	153.23788
at the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot .	92.178154
the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when kearton lost sight of ulyate and called , ulyate answered from ten feet away .	90.89007
nice country to meet a lion in face to face .	17.654009
ulyate and kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the crest , and peering through the branches of a bush , this is what ulyate saw jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside , sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness , who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs whirled around her .	79.28722
ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to lips , almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off , `` the dogs have got her bayed .	129.22981
she ' s just the other side of that bush ' ' ! !	31.968353
and when they had drawn back a step he added `` jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her .	61.02836
why she doesn ' t charge him , i don ' t know .	14.140606
and he hasn ' t even got a knife on him .	38.791763
he couldn ' t get away from her in this kind of ground .	65.20885
careful , don ' t disturb her ' ' .	1.512006
jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the reef .	48.755985
she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared , opening her mouth wide , lashing her tail , and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation , as much as to say `` how dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct ' ' ? ?	67.89826
intuition told him , however , that she was tired and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge , yet .	103.67763
he moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less predictable than the male .	69.35577
( in the graveyard at nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso .	203.23608
of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses .	46.42289
) she snarled terribly but intuition told him , again , that she was bluffing , and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs .	50.973595
it was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock .	53.479633
even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her .	85.96194
but john nipped her rear end -- one lion ' s rear end was as good as another to john , africa , arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at john , but he ducked back .	115.70245
jones then recoiled his rope and threw again , this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her .	140.8223
she whirled and faced him , roaring terribly , and ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him , because he wouldn ' t have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace uncertain	86.3517
while jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer .	317.93958
from the lioness ' point of view , this strange creature on the back of another creature , lashing out with its long thin paw , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with .	108.53102
but now she sank lower to the rock .	3.0330672
although she appeared more subdued and defeated , jones knew she was growing more dangerous .	107.591774
she was rested and could mount a charge .	12.515637
just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet .	51.280693
at this moment , loveless and means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks .	41.209145
the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded old john .	218.87122
`` we ' ve got to get her out of there ' ' ! !	22.818087
jones yelled , `` or she ' ll kill ' em all .	36.453854
for such an emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of their equipment .	50.51836
lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed .	57.173695
`` ain ' t she a beauty , though ' ' ? ?	30.098259
`` don ' t you go a step nearer her than i do ' ' , jones warned , `` and if you do , go at a run so you ' ll have momentum ' ' ! !	32.306644
for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the reef , trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw .	66.134964
but she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away .	47.80059
it was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again .	67.73131
and the sun was beginning to go down .	12.220918
`` i ' ll get a pole ' ' , jones said finally , `` and i ' ll poke a noose over her head ' ' ! !	18.240656
at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the reef .	43.45713
ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions ' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason .	56.458206
`` it won ' t work , colonel ' ' .	9.330173
`` just the same we ' ll try it ' ' .	4.467812
but without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain .	71.55858
john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood .	50.573677
john himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning .	99.50295
she took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up .	23.485435
with the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land .	58.501297
`` careful , now ' ' , jones warned .	8.755449
very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion .	50.19851
they tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion , but these didn ' t .	45.909042
again she snarled , and again he edged .	5.4718776
with a whirling jump , it could get into gear .	75.24771
however nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a cheetah .	45.201393
she was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here jones and loveless and ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound .	113.12611
means held steady one jump ahead of her .	7.573121
a western cowpony had outrun an african lion , from a standing start .	53.34722
photos showed later that she ' d been about six feet from means .	102.15703
of course the factor of head start made all the difference .	56.854797
the lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn ' t catch means , and made for jones .	70.47537
as she had done with means , she gained rapidly at first , but then baldy began to draw away .	102.740654
somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point .	117.52988
when jones too drew away , she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully , crouched low and waited as before .	58.818737
this new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance .	204.57356
there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went .	325.12656
so means edged around on the north side of her , jones moved in from the south .	69.12679
tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .	42.39547
he succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back .	126.0468
from behind her means shot forward at a run .	140.25468
kearton began shouting , `` wait , wait -- the camera ' s jammed ' ' ! !	24.20033
he raced by within twenty feet of her , roped her around the neck , but a lioness ' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off .	65.6924
the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies .	142.44966
but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life .	76.48173
the christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .	121.912224
the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .	50.250813
most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .	87.54227
they may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical rover boys ' ' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so .	118.8123
as long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt .	31.972097
the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .	84.2362
progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference ' ' of the national council or the world council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors .	61.986633
the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .	212.59973
until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality .	66.588196
as things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main street in the nation .	89.22028
the crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community .	55.259335
the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members .	60.43545
it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .	137.4787
it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .	194.38509
it has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots ' ' .	37.54161
this way of describing the matter is unfortunate .	1.9660457
one is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top ' ' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels ' ' .	57.249264
the truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world .	39.001446
the other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .	74.20881
however needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ in the world .	44.116653
the basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation .	65.92555
it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .	11.447757
most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .	110.806206
the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .	191.53703
the jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the christian congregation , but hinduism , buddhism , islam , confucianism , taoism , shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .	49.139717
their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship .	72.840904
how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia ! !	189.98277
what is now called christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .	90.23347
the koinonia of acts and of the epistles means sharing in a common relation to christ .	82.596725
it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of christ in his people .	56.636574
as dietrich bonhoffer puts it , `` our community with one another consists solely in what christ has done to both of us ' ' .	120.49001
this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all .	73.17346
there is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .	73.188225
whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal church , in vital relation with the whole body of christ and participating in his mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .	62.596134
the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .	71.931335
of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place .	65.650566
each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .	37.800644
our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .	48.3366
and this is what all too often happens .	15.016883
a little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor bela vasady at the end of the second world war .	31.637016
with great difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world council of churches .	37.05495
when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .	199.77792
he often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical ' ' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church .	51.958878
it is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both .	136.05586
as things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other .	44.20987
on the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town .	84.5074
they do not escape the pitfall into which charles dickens pictured mrs . jellyby as falling .	97.38181
her concern for the natives of borrioboola-gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son peepy ! !	122.7878
likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in east germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary china , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .	56.36046
on the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission .	95.78011
as a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families .	42.510113
it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members .	93.58984
the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .	41.898445
the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .	142.95067
it is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .	13.527142
its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .	86.74788
it provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .	630.3776
it helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible .	60.624702
it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation .	58.65587
and it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .	131.647
but what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians in the world ? ?	62.21491
all too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind .	65.49307
it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of christ .	63.718544
it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .	22.658058
it is not making them sensitive to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .	162.16919
it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples .	42.422523
it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in asia and africa .	89.40362
to put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want .	177.21123
it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility in relation to the world .	35.015694
we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness and mission to the world .	73.78332
there is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community .	71.812584
he built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn .	82.81181
desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it .	117.826385
a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` do you belong to this church , mr . rancher ' ' ? ?	30.215132
`` why , no , ma ' am ' ' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me ' ' ! !	11.180839
the story reflects the way too many people feel .	48.551662
as long as the congregation regards the church as `` our ' ' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my ' ' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .	74.81174
there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to christ , and that it is his purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do .	53.474766
a local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .	101.78447
it would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the church of christ .	79.92512
yet the truth , according to the new testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place .	96.78011
yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms	73.900955
and buggies and wagons and chugging fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap .	133.75023
this was a bitterly fought game , carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight , with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd .	140.95337
every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision .	138.23268
at one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys , he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead ' ' or the base runners were free to score .	95.200066
this was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship .	139.52733
when the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly , `` you bunch of hay-shakers ! !	56.06366
baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business .	88.62826
radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the cubs or the pirates or the indians or the red sox .	78.30384
young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major leagues .	95.263916
nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the three i league , or the pony league , or the coastal plains league , or the fast eastern league , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere .	115.65976
even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over .	85.39964
babe ruth , of course , was everyone ' s hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball .	143.78381
his face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life .	209.78719
as the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by babe ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account .	113.65035
boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up ' ' on a bat as willie keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done .	64.89072
other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching ruth , who was still called jidge by all his friends , or leo or two-head by those who dared to taunt him ( leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` kid ' ' .	73.60102
lou gehrig was given the nickname buster , and he ran ruth a close race in home runs .	132.4743
but the nickname never stuck and gehrig was no match for ruth in `` color ' ' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field .	103.03998
ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it .	69.67856
a few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with daddy browning ' s , al capone ' s , earl sande ' s , and the prince of wales ' .	36.34571
one who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was charles arthur shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , art the great , or the great shires .	78.116035
it was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists .	81.86244
he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond	163.34567
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in art ' s pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first baseman for some forgotten reason .	142.21912
( this made a sportswriter named pegler wonder in print if art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager .	175.49008
) the sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public .	100.1967
in his minor way charles arthur shires was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these scott fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers .	129.30347
there were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down	29.263363
or who ingested strange objects , like live fish	1445.7788
or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner	243.3683
or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .	74.30799
one young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the yale-army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once .	74.080894
but the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition .	205.51588
the business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to george herman ruth ' s spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too .	125.315056
while fifty years before , albert goodwill spalding , secretary of the chicago ball club of the national league , could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in august , in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate .	53.12804
and while less than ten years earlier the wayward black sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy charles comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season .	87.89286
the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new york yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named ed barrow and miller huggins .	112.92906
boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the red sox -- sold to millionaires huston and ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire .	58.524006
ruth himself , still owning his farm in massachusetts and an interest in the massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from fenway park , followed by pitchers carl mays , leslie `` joe ' ' bush , waite hoyt , herb pennock , and sam jones , catcher wally schang , third baseman joe dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio ' ' of ruth , dugan , and hoyt ) , and shortstop everett scott .	50.348213
by 1926 , when the mighty yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like tony lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , mark koenig , lou gehrig , george pipgras , and gray-thatched earl combs .	47.12324
the deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two world ' s series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said .	82.5405
but there is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one world ' s series game in 1926 like best to recall .	124.01383
babe ruth , as he always did in the stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and tommy thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st . louis cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where ruth could not reach it .	101.150024
the ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` where ' s the -- -ing ball ' ' ? ?	75.84165
but , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me ' ' , so little tommy ran all the way home .	82.722855
the ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those golden days , or of any other sporting event for that matter .	148.95703
promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .	69.26174
radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers ' ' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .	136.1225
in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .	135.31543
this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .	112.19695
while women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport ' ' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one .	73.120834
the questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers	143.59511
for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male american in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists .	105.79929
and women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball .	58.424297
radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` ladies ' days ' ' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home .	95.85829
women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears .	104.64555
the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .	94.51432
this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal ' ' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .	89.687614
our discussion of this involves using erik erikson ' s schema of `` identity vs . identity diffusion ' ' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .	55.309105
our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers .	57.447792
we hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .	56.147316
hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual ' s infancy and end in his old age , erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises .	46.493202
the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual ' s positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .	76.54141
within erikson ' s schema , the adolescent ' s delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion ' ' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively .	47.781208
the adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs . time diffusion .	149.49731
time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives .	89.425316
erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .	152.7947
experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately .	86.73163
these polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .	66.147835
some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .	65.19246
others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .	68.72074
for many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general .	92.26241
however , as erickson has noted , the individual ' s failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .	65.42674
and , as shown in chapter 6 , , some snp females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .	163.82257
in the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .	103.03055
the adolescent experiences two closely related crises self-certainty vs . an identity consciousness	163.1082
a sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one ' s own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy .	104.75719
however , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups	134.22034
inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards	453.20343
and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded .	180.23491
her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .	112.25989
to be different is to invite shame and doubt	3845.3562
and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one ' s parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one ' s peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status .	86.37945
the attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .	92.506454
many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others	139.52774
but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one ' s self .	75.91966
another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs . work-paralysis .	24.672714
the adolescent ' s capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood .	83.04
the developmental process involves the individual ' s progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one ' s own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be ' ' ) .	125.45095
these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .	107.04652
if she has not had such experiences , the female ' s normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded .	64.41571
she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e . g . , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker	83.21406
whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school	824.6906
whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school	171.1474
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .	194.50655
erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship ' ' .	17.408176
this paralysis may be expressed in the female ' s starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study	152.90715
and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes .	81.55566
the absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .	146.86761
the comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .	37.45922
they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made	97.22054
they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .	131.42941
these things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .	61.718304
as their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs .	45.103924
these affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done .	194.39835
childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy .	44.840984
the excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .	133.46146
for example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence	89.129875
they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .	137.12177
on the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .	139.38722
the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs . diffusion of ideals .	80.13928
in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose erikson ' s concept on our data .	44.82204
adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or ' ' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant .	42.511166
this tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .	91.572136
erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man ' s-land between childhood and adulthood .	65.65598
it provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .	118.97501
the positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty .	116.83255
most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .	34.801853
the diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .	93.35976
a pronounced ideological diffusion -- i . e . , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .	81.96146
for example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice .	170.68587
it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .	87.00883
in another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers ' ' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs .	39.543083
the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother ' s inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .	97.02214
for example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly ' ' .	107.03377
they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .	49.41384
they condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .	47.01044
they criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong	56.42112
and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive ' ' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant ' ' .	60.914124
in the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent ' s search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .	152.35533
for example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys ' ' and the `` bad guys ' ' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences .	43.549713
in the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .	75.44636
an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive .	46.11172
yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure .	128.86252
the duration and other circumstances of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions .	42.25111
the suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the american patent system .	80.95039
chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .	75.10067
in a long and angry footnote to his opinion , judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism .	95.57423
`` it is a duty ' ' , said hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the supreme court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation .	88.17822
as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , i fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of equity ' ' .	53.931156
observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples ' ' , hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures .	86.50372
he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case record	295.1029
the `` objections stated at outrageous length ' '	1.0011702
and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , `` uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct ' ' .	66.98573
the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example ' ' , concluded hough , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony ' ' .	89.95667
not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the selden suit .	84.85919
william a . redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years .	95.49319
inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the selden litigation as a `` horrible example ' ' .	35.268993
its costive deliberations were likened to those of the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in bleak house .	76.85037
parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects .	47.374718
but he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried .	26.16069
in a detailed letter published in the scientific american in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements ' ' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts .	82.00391
the suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases .	205.47719
parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony .	49.712856
in a private communication written in 1911 , parker had been more to the point .	54.79705
noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded ' ' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent .	52.110054
the vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance ' ' for or against the patent , said parker .	93.72743
`` this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur ' ' .	70.09201
parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony .	109.53355
the most important of these found him in agreement with hough ' s plea for reform .	93.53465
parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony .	116.1197
the taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony .	127.12313
`` i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that ' ' .	103.980286
in the end hough ' s acidulous protest , which parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' selden ' case ' ' , did not go unheeded .	128.22842
in 1912 the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on february 1 , 1913 .	59.322872
the revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform .	55.28854
under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character .	70.575325
other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits .	22.137981
one of the a . l . a . m . lawyers observed that if the selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume ' ' .	72.06255
while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money .	118.90446
there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme court as a direct result of the selden patent suit .	11.926208
even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the a . l . a . m . was succeeded by the automobile board of trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturers association .	30.534204
the trade bodies which came in the wake of the a . l . a . m . were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion .	37.067833
nevertheless , it is from the selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .	60.97396
one of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of american industrial cooperation .	68.38326
its origin lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath .	102.19225
from the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the a . l . a . m . was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem .	30.990095
many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .	44.29647
the fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims .	46.039955
as early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers .	159.1858
this scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 .	96.30421
in this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the a . l . a . m . at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation .	64.475914
the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the a . l . a . m . patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology .	61.95865
one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among a . l . a . m . members .	30.159151
within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement .	139.60901
its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly .	42.41567
since the a . l . a . m . holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry .	63.605682
the highly important dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the a . l . a . m . pool .	27.93256
but henry ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor .	102.56307
for those affiliated with it , the a . l . a . m . pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 .	66.62234
by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions .	24.412731
it was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail .	54.908657
`` purely from the business man ' s standpoint and without regard to the lawyer ' s view ' ' , commented a trade journal , `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation ' ' .	113.52247
occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .	83.888504
one manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said `` i would readily put over $50 , 000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits ' ' .	60.084606
the prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee `` the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste ' ' .	104.957085
by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information .	86.31251
at this point charles c . hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the national automobile chamber of commerce , successor to the automobile board of trade .	62.351078
hanch was treasurer of the nordyke & marmon company , an indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the marmon car in 1904 .	70.49151
he had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890 ' s .	43.9847
anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , hanch went to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading a . l . a . m . members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan .	36.20442
the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal , but hanch did not abandon his scheme .	78.7216
after the demise of the a . l . a . m . , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool .	27.788252
most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .	54.442375
`` it is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned ' ' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day ' ' .	90.99345
with the other members of the patents committee -- wilfred c . leland , howard e . coffin , windsor t . white , and w . h . vandervoort -- hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution .	70.83165
the plan was supported by frederick p . fish , counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce .	41.134796
it will be recalled that in his summation for the a . l . a . m . before judge hough , fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial community .	49.297737
he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value .	128.1685
`` my personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making ' ' , he later told a congressional committee .	181.36151
the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .	23.099012
drawn up in 1914 , the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 .	55.61217
it remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925 .	48.43564
a little farther along the road you come to the church of santa sabina , called the `` pearl of the aventine ' ' .	18.211124
continue another hundred yards to the piazza of the knights of malta .	22.615444
on the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .	39.6395
the massive gate of the maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in rome .	27.457033
if you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of st . peter ' s framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees .	29.471313
retrace your steps a few yards on the via di santa sabina and turn right on the via di s . alessio , a street lined with stately homes .	25.469358
oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section .	239.31013
turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the via di santa prisca to the viale aventino .	27.507877
here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city .	38.18224
these two walks take you through the heart of rome .	11.067941
you will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi .	94.06709
you will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the spanish steps , and the lovely pincian gardens .	67.70886
by seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of renaissance rome .	103.17646
you will realize why rome is indeed the eternal city .	169.41476
start on the via d . teatro di marcello at the foot of the capitoline hill .	12.442686
the majestic circular tiers of stone of the theatre of marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the emperor augustus erected in 13 b . c . .	45.60327
twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in roman days .	235.91034
andrea palladio , an italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its doric and ionic columns .	52.15771
wander past the three superb columns of apollo by the arches of the theatre .	24.662552
the remains of the portico of octavia are now in front of you .	47.487293
climb the steps from the theatre to the via della tribuna di campitelli for an even better view of the columns of apollo .	41.551105
turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny piazza campitelli , then proceed along the via dei funari to the piazza mattei .	17.724596
here is one of the loveliest fountains in rome , the fontana delle tartarughe or `` fountain of the tortoises ' ' .	14.115985
it ' s typical of rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square .	71.627335
stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin .	55.341976
the figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement .	70.767365
opposite is the palazzo mattei , one of rome ' s oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the italo-american association .	30.971563
go inside for a closer look at a renaissance palace .	38.594673
in the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall .	55.964115
the palazzo caetani , still inhabited by the caetani family , adjoins the palazzo mattei .	46.329815
keep straight ahead on the via falegnami , cross the wide via arenula , and you will come to the piazza b . cairoli , where you should look in at the church of san carlo ai catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling .	50.465282
follow the colorful and busy via d . giubbonari for a hundred yards or so .	44.698357
now turn left at the via dell ' arco del monte to the piazza dei pellegrini .	9.786797
just a few yards to the right on the via capo di ferro will bring you to the palazzo spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the council of state .	23.887114
paintings by titian , caravaggio , and rubens are on display ( open 9 30 to 4 00 ) .	47.904675
before you enter the palazzo , note francesco borromini ' s facade .	8.420388
the great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts .	48.096066
the large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of pompey at the base of which julius caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) .	81.14146
( this is shown in the afternoon and on sunday morning .	73.74924
by tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard borromini ' s unusual and fascinating trick in perspective .	43.57708
when you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away .	44.139347
the sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front .	62.136017
the gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive .	38.79413
from the palazzo spada you continue another block along the via capo di ferro and vicolo de venti to the imposing palazzo farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all .	25.695606
michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it .	124.59535
today it is occupied by the french embassy .	3.8519225
its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen sundays ( 11 00 to 12 00 noon ) .	70.21953
ask to see the modern tapestries of paris and rome designed by lurcat .	100.4775
directly in front of the palace along the via d . baullari you will come to the campo di fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of renaissance rome .	38.89247
today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market .	82.01818
continue on the via d . baullari to the corso vittorio emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the church of sant ' andrea della valle .	20.87602
as you approach the church on the via d . baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the roman theatre of pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where julius caesar was assassinated .	63.99704
the dome of the church is , outside of st . peter ' s , one of the largest in rome .	18.282469
opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of tosca .	46.309273
at this point you cross the wide corso vittorio emanuele 2 , , walk along the corso del rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the via dei canestrani to enter the splendid piazza navona , one of the truly glorious sights in rome .	25.490633
your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk .	111.30923
the site of the oblong piazza is domitian ' s ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races .	35.24113
for centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events .	28.969639
from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages .	80.23465
giovanni bernini ' s `` fountain of the rivers ' ' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a roman obelisk from the circus of maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the danube , the ganges , the nile , and the plate .	51.53531
the eyes of the figure of the nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the church of sant ' agnese in agone , the work of bernini ' s rival , borromini .	53.943707
in the piazza navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square .	48.336823
the scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about rome .	165.4801
perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch .	373.1797
take the via di s . agnese in agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful church of santa maria della pace .	52.47847
inside you will find the lovely sibyls painted by raphael and a chapel designed by michelangelo .	46.517673
the church ' s cloisters are among donato bramante ' s most beautiful creations .	7.9966645
now return to the piazza navona and leave it on the opposite side by the corsia agonale	30.957092
in a moment cross the corso del rinascimento .	13.105148
in front of you is the palazzo madama , once belonging to the medici and now the italian senate .	132.19371
walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the via giustiniani you will come to the piazza della rotonda .	30.943804
you are now facing the pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient rome .	93.248665
this circular edifice , constructed by agrippa in b . c . 27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the emperor hadrian .	32.343815
it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century .	30.44149
as you pause in the piazza by the egyptian obelisk brought from the temple of isis , you will admire the pantheon ' s impressive corinthian columns .	33.305824
the pantheon ' s interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph .	89.9804
its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling .	19.58055
the only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .	64.94279
standing before the tomb of raphael , the great genius of the renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of rome .	114.97423
as you leave the pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the via del seminario , a block to sant ' ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city .	22.745605
( along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , la sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in rome .	46.7898
) the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set .	52.079117
this is one of the most charming little squares in this part of rome .	47.58458
one block along the via de burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the stock exchange in the old temple of neptune .	55.57882
a few yards farther , on the via dei bergamaschi , is the piazza colonna .	12.773815
the great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor marcus aurelius .	18.280212
you are now at the corso , though narrow , one of rome ' s busiest streets .	54.0762
horse races took place here in the middle ages .	5.409688
if you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the palazzo doria ( open sunday , tuesday , and thursday , 10 00 to 1 00 ) .	64.773254
here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives .	68.64044
otherwise , cross over the corso and walk a block or so to the left .	66.16499
you will come to alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries .	54.399426
either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of rome .	81.460075
the second walk through the heart of rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the pincian hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best .	70.0774
rare , indeed , is the harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality .	65.53197
i myself have witnessed and endured it more than once .	28.72974
the businessmen and racketeers also have a story .	45.1177
( and this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss harlem ' s very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to harlem , that they are nearly all downtown .	127.97662
it is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves .	63.58106
he , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed .	58.96679
he has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ?	166.94061
-- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it .	57.57422
there is no way for him not to know it there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people .	108.00732
he moves through harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country	75.09834
which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes .	35.64637
and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company the people who are watching him know why , too .	125.19178
any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination .	194.70596
and these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination .	111.830124
the white policeman standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world .	73.96773
he is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him .	74.05755
even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in .	182.36398
he cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children .	72.46553
he knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .	111.828255
he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature .	354.96216
he becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased .	101.18553
one day , to everyone ' s astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up .	92.59428
before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened .	59.111687
what happened is that negroes want to be treated like men .	202.22028
negroes want to be treated like men a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words .	149.1086
people who have mastered kant , hegel , shakespeare , marx , freud , and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable .	76.509445
the idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions .	125.48727
a kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place .	39.592434
i once tried to describe to a very well-known american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south .	163.73253
and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` why don ' t all the negroes in the south move north ' ' ? ?	29.811007
i tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of negroes move north .	295.2079
they do not escape jim crow they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety .	319.00012
they do not move to chicago , they move to the south side	32.010735
they do not move to new york , they move to harlem .	43.01691
the pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent .	122.29778
white people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence .	57.552505
but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto .	25.228907
the white people fall back bitterly before the black horde	153.09853
the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep	71.719505
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf ' ' .	19.076532
this is precisely what happened when the puerto ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as i write , being fought out all up and down those streets .	179.93094
they seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil war , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the south , without taking any responsibility for it	52.39778
and that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse .	85.60705
well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse ' ' .	41.746326
i know negroes who prefer the south and white southerners , because `` at least there , you haven ' t got to play any guessing games ' ' ! !	70.73852
the guessing games referred to have driven more than one negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river .	69.5631
i know another negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` the spirit of the south is the spirit of america ' ' .	35.59784
he was born in the north and did his military training in the south .	55.081734
he did not , as far as i can gather , find the south `` worse ' '	114.99742
he found it , if anything , all too familiar .	96.880905
in the second place , though , even if birmingham is worse , no doubt johannesburg , south africa , beats it by several miles , and buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world .	56.206303
but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes .	43.119522
this perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling .	64.62169
the emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes .	87.71534
thirdly , the south is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us .	79.535126
as far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the southern white and the northerner the southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of eden in which he loved black people and they loved him .	69.01175
historically , the flaming sword laid across this eden is the civil war .	67.28435
personally , it is the southerner ' s sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past .	115.815605
everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need .	131.40529
the resulting , indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the basis of the southern hysteria .	54.364513
none of this is true for the northerner .	11.631958
negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality .	74.854416
northerners never think about them whereas southerners are never really thinking of anything else .	71.16057
negroes are , therefore , ignored in the north and are under surveillance in the south , and suffer hideously in both places .	65.635666
neither the southerner nor the northerner is able to look on the negro simply as a man .	47.467304
it seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many negroes , comparatively , bought cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) .	113.21969
they are two sides of the same coin and the south will not change -- cannot change -- until the north changes .	222.46152
the country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .	158.1444
in the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us .	43.103664
it is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one ' s own in the face of one ' s victim , one sees oneself .	65.061035
walk through the streets of harlem and see what we , this nation , have become .	135.04373
east river , downtown postscript to a letter from harlem	119.176636
the fact that american negroes rioted in the u . n . while adlai stevenson was addressing the assembly shocked and baffled most white americans .	53.62854
stevenson ' s speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in katanga , the day before , of patrice lumumba .	53.38477
stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the united states was `` against ' ' colonialism .	28.541103
god knows what the african nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the u . n . were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the u . s . abstention when the vote on algerian freedom was before the assembly -- but i think i have a fairly accurate notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking .	53.04284
it was my first reaction upon hearing of lumumba ' s death .	17.03307
i was curious about the impact of this political assassination on negroes in harlem , for lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there .	334.47974
i was curious to know if lumumba ' s death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our ' ' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric .	81.97787
and i was curious about the african reaction .	12.272464
however , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the u . n . gallery .	25.711914
had i been there , i , too , in the eyes of most americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the communists .	29.190517
the climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold ' ' war , have given americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were `` communist ' ' inspired .	59.550083
nor was it long , naturally , before prominent negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the u . n . rioters do not represent the real feeling of the negro community .	50.38967
according , then , to what i take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , stalinist-corrupted provocateurs .	66.12027
it is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict .	273.83752
one has only , for example , to walk through harlem and ask oneself two questions .	320.5926
the first question is would i like to live here ? ?	32.447586
and the second question is why don ' t those who now live here move out ? ?	85.65854
the answer to both questions is immediately obvious .	2.1927602
unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that negroes are , somehow , different from white people , i do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the negro ' s status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability .	72.105995
now , i do not doubt that , among the people at the u . n . that day , there were stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .	55.51282
wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found .	66.30357
their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .	102.91241
what i find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the american assumption that the negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest .	80.6646
it is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .	64.80272
color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties .	110.0542
movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .	73.38473
each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen .	78.26289
as long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .	289.34305
motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as times square .	105.73167
brief snips of actual events were shown parades , dances , street scenes .	75.75379
the sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .	45.274734
an early edison production was the execution of mary , queen of scots .	99.51927
an early film by a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .	134.2444
in the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows .	145.0392
in response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .	75.74151
despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story .	68.419075
moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .	183.18227
thus such great american documentaries as the river and the plow that broke the plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .	188.41466
the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a french magician , georges melies , and an american employee of edison , edwin s . porter .	37.6357
of the two , porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands .	131.50089
melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film .	58.18892
one of these is the `` dissolve ' ' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .	90.97449
as the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .	122.300476
for a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .	217.73233
in a series of fairy tales and fantasies , melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions .	88.527695
immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time .	217.21466
physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers ' ' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .	157.24545
linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement .	37.195465
the `` projection ' ' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions .	89.28659
the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .	97.641365
the time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .	156.79591
the film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames ' ' , 35-mm . -wide .	40.08155
each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .	94.24111
time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time .	150.06877
now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .	139.08237
the `` moving ' ' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree	79.678345
the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo .	107.01804
in narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .	49.83309
almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .	258.36438
this discovery of melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician ' s tricks produced on film .	129.7163
it was porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .	169.5718
the movie was the great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .	147.79973
overnight , for one thing , porter ' s film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten .	228.13681
the great train robbery is a one-reel film .	3.9745295
one reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of robbery , 1903 , until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of a nation in 1915 .	106.02908
the reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .	106.887024
much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old west -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950 ' s .	60.417297
a band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes .	77.32732
a posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .	99.343796
the robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .	69.11473
as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .	90.652176
all this is simple enough , but in telling the story porter did two important things that had not been done before .	131.60275
each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , porter ' s camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play .	138.88593
the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen .	48.56838
if the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen .	92.781624
in that apparently simple shift porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device .	38.662025
he revealed the potential value of the `` cut ' ' as the basic technique in the art of the film .	27.771132
cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film .	55.285007
the meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .	109.53548
the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .	66.991745
if , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .	110.52404
if , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child ' s grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film	93.41136
as the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher ' s little daughter arrives with her father ' s dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor .	71.31843
the two events are taking place at the same time .	4.3261766
we leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in `` reality ' ' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance .	82.628395
the `` chase ' ' as a standard film device probably dates from the great train robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device .	61.46086
it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both .	249.32239
the simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .	90.199005
the cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence	84.17593
these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .	73.01384
the creator of the art of the film d . w . griffith	22.442225
there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .	80.398674
when he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .	148.22807
in about seven years griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker .	99.812164
before he was forty griffith had created the art of the film .	21.680342
not that there had not been attempts , mostly european , to do exactly that .	235.84657
but in general the european efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .	85.91354
staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .	54.716682
great actors and actresses -- the most notable being sarah bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera .	123.12217
in all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author .	99.094376
the phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .	67.07261
not surprisingly , this approach did not work .	16.170485
the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names .	95.78449
but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .	79.899666
in general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis	41.99993
congregational membership , however , is another thing .	21.668184
a congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership	244.51767
that is , when it can preserve economic integration .	4.9032774
religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining	109.33228
the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .	52.198677
the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches .	102.00525
central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes	72.99727
( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .	159.50964
the central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations they have too few middle-class people	104.40945
central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities .	41.297447
with few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .	146.32097
the key to protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation .	38.8421
members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes	227.87502
but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum .	39.2436
the congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood	103.46123
moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive	47.292416
they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .	29.295294
the congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group	519.49225
it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .	2.5605242
if it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the new protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do .	55.40622
they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .	24.68097
the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit ' ' of protestant religious life	47.654915
in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal ' ' roman catholic parish .	36.483913
we have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers	211.28593
consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations	59.896038
actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection .	100.47189
the vulnerability of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration .	38.404415
this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .	32.48909
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .	16.562674
there is much talk in theological circles about the `` church as mission ' ' and the `` church ' s mission ' '	28.512403
theologians have been stressing the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .	30.840132
a crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism .	246.12953
if economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration .	69.09977
the task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .	59.588825
( co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy	32.02383
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .	68.230896
) in a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment	100.85047
this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation	65.18267
therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated .	59.729958
evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches	100.152565
one study in pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .	94.19421
in a sample of new members of pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members ' ' .	69.69587
if we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church ' ' ( 11 . 2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .	61.33076
on the surface , this seems a sound approach to christian mission members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people	125.83894
the new people respond in kind by joining the church .	6.405736
missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods	250.21277
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position	56.747894
association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .	28.84724
this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation	37.95629
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation	85.79936
the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation .	23.948038
churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration	69.19417
once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going .	317.66333
the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .	99.76753
the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17 . 3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .	123.7289
publicity accounted for 1 . 1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .	34.007168
in general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church	73.36303
economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .	187.42717
the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together	122.26286
the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership .	49.83775
economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation .	79.152626
in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation .	68.19353
the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .	63.58291
the expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society	145.1043
nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the protestant development .	62.602135
it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .	102.3061
these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .	40.51423
residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .	4.870483
the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized	320.20517
the schism between central city and suburb , negro and white , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .	64.72388
it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .	41.94998
the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .	38.921413
this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .	106.92133
more than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples .	61.12242
since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .	63.76049
consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests .	44.28588
negroes , puerto ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .	116.56184
soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .	127.60839
the identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .	50.430126
mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion .	103.87027
this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .	120.977455
it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .	89.99996
it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .	169.02866
whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .	38.299213
attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches	92.82601
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .	47.59267
the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .	143.66257
these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .	56.240376
`` fellowship by likeness ' ' and `` mission by friendly contact ' ' form the iron cage of denominational religion .	92.77424
its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .	51.52375
what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church .	77.410065
an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .	66.13386
the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need .	103.12467
with capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue .	137.53497
the directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company .	115.374596
these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .	92.88034
the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to france in company ships .	76.84418
the company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show .	182.04929
in accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians .	130.15248
the lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men .	61.74724
traders from the english colonies were far more generous , and indian loyalty turned to them .	81.535
protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company .	103.738754
in 1721 the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .	73.45149
they ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75 , 000 livres with which to build forts .	61.815144
they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts .	60.951084
in each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses .	62.66159
for southeastern louisiana , mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by british traders .	33.025948
mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the tennessee river .	43.04169
fort toulouse , on the alabama river , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas and choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present nashville , tennessee , and this was soon abandoned .	59.59553
west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district , of which new orleans was headquarters .	52.10348
dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of new spain .	41.502434
on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas .	25.985987
it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the arkansas river .	70.677666
on the ohio or wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers ' ' .	92.62576
other posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication with canada .	113.724724
on the upper mississippi the illinois post was to be established near kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the missouri , `` where there are mines in abundance ' ' .	43.775223
each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at new orleans .	60.372402
an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way .	57.591957
concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors .	14.703805
engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended .	84.58158
the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires .	44.14466
only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at mobile , the other at new orleans .	99.14367
new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi , and west of that river , and on the ohio and wabash .	38.968742
mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district .	56.624634
the power that bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .	123.65529
regulations for the indian trade were made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane , and bienville apparently did not have control of that body .	68.42554
the conseil even treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade ' ' .	80.94792
it decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen carolinians .	31.306871
during the first administration of bienville , the peltry trade of the mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue .	43.446274
the alabamas brought in annually 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 deerskins , and the choctaws and chickasaws brought the total up to 50 , 000 pelts .	28.45955
these deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods .	138.88347
during his first administration , bienville succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country .	144.59912
the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the indian needs .	70.41242
the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply .	49.085037
de la laude , commander of the alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the british as poor competitors .	50.348648
diron d ' artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors .	41.91669
he became , after a time , commander of a post on the alabama river , but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade .	42.979763
the chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district .	37.640305
their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the alabama , the tombigbee , the tennessee , and cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees .	42.126587
in 1720 some chickasaws massacred the french traders among them , and did not make peace for four years .	56.67434
venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the french markets .	37.386147
british traders from south carolina incited the indians against the french , and there developed french and british factions in the tribe .	49.796513
the chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana .	151.08554
to hold them was an essential part of french policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile .	56.03346
they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french settlements near the gulf .	135.58812
bienville realized that if the french were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british goods , french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the carolinians and at reasonable prices .	50.810062
the company of the indies promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins .	59.62575
but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country .	110.53142
the insistence of bienville upon giving liberal prices to the indians , in order to drive back the carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 .	67.611626
for two years his friend and cousin , boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance .	198.08888
although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the carolina advance continued .	103.029854
the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina , and when perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district .	71.88484
but the company of the indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices .	188.16154
to the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .	38.607174
perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the indians .	87.99644
these agents were to ascertain the difference between english and french goods , and the prices charged the indians .	56.806805
they were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina .	55.631294
they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering .	84.760796
one was british and the other , french .	155.12917
so hostile did these factions become that , among the choctaws , civil war broke out .	72.17713
perier ' s efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country .	66.18752
he asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest english traders and disloyal indians .	60.000175
in spite of the company ' s restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .	46.81486
he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians ' pelts .	47.85067
no help came from the crown , and perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d ' artaguette .	36.468178
d ' artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters .	100.19102
but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon french trade in the region was at an end .	51.427383
perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france .	47.26322
the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the mississippi .	70.432304
with the loss of the mobile trade , which ended all profits from louisiana , the natchez indians revolted .	63.280987
they destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed french shipping on the mississippi .	61.547028
the war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .	24.800234
in january , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony .	49.710392
it stated that it had lost 20 , 000 , 000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade .	45.364113
it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity .	68.16482
the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1 , 450 , 000 livres .	21.650537
thenceforth , the commerce of louisiana was free to all frenchmen .	49.944363
company rule in louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies .	23.064123
the difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .	44.78033
others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the indian trade .	48.33809
if this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois .	76.2753
this was a slow and difficult course , and french trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders .	89.966415
perier and salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts .	120.42372
bienville , who returned to succeed perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits .	61.446735
he reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king ' s goods .	66.83964
he did find some to trust , however , and he employed the king ' s soldiers to trade .	35.032738
with no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders .	149.56078
in order to compete with english traders , bienville radically changed the price schedule .	267.78494
the king should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders .	75.69948
they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury ' s expense .	106.481895
they would be particularly displeased with the state department if it were the source of such reports .	62.00904
few things are more perilous for the state department than a displeased congressman .	60.72663
the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are so available .	102.018234
first , the state department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters .	101.14023
the farmers may be aroused if congress cuts into the agriculture department ' s budget .	20.111786
businessmen will rise if congress attacks the commerce department .	12.818886
the chamber of commerce , assaults upon the treasury .	123.8574
a kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the department of health , education , and welfare .	43.569622
the congressman ' s patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense department .	55.677654
tampering with the post office may infuriate every voter who can write .	122.31662
with all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly .	164.96596
no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the state department in anger .	47.737164
in many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .	155.8291
after all , the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners .	102.88145
not only do these foreigners not vote for american congressmen	153.11467
they are also probably ungrateful for uncle ' s sam ' s bounty .	19.54671
and are not the state department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ? ?	108.36306
will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ? ?	94.05938
the result is that the state department ' s perpetual position before congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife .	105.38682
people in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers .	86.15493
the department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion .	45.807404
state is expected to arrange the touring cicero ' s foreign itinerary	19.603096
its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way	197.03877
embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children ' s college tuition .	59.951897
but come the next session of congress , state can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats .	271.6985
the congressman who , in paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury .	178.76247
in the matter of money state ' s most unrelenting watchdog during the eisenhower years was representative john j . rooney , of brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses .	102.600586
diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with nikita khrushchev , but with john rooney .	80.33257
in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps .	108.40187
`` the trouble , ' ' explained loy henderson , then deputy undersecretary for administration , `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we do ' ' .	87.3555
one year the department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government ' s entertainment bills out of personal income .	84.66999
next day , reports went through the department that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar .	141.07697
the department ' s constant fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the senate .	66.90932
armed with constitutional power to negate the executive ' s foreign policy , the senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department ' s back , or on the head of the secretary of state .	42.477905
with its power to investigate , the senate can paralyze the secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with dean acheson .	103.18468
john foster dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson , who was then operating the senate , refused to let it become an inquisition .	92.03068
during dulles ' s first two years in office , while republicans ran the senate , the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 .	96.01936
an internal police operation managed by scott mcleod , a former f . b . i . man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance .	103.50371
so was the attack upon charles e . bohlen when eisenhower appointed him ambassador to moscow .	257.30103
the principal mauler , however , was senator joseph mccarthy .	7.4498878
where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the department , dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates .	73.16087
fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way .	93.33576
in view of eisenhower ' s reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country ' s foreign policy .	42.935413
in any event , the example of acheson ' s trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke it .	44.374836
he elected to `` get along ' ' .	3.157858
during this dark chapter in state department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol hill .	245.60419
their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent .	49.5631
their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas .	109.63957
this , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats took control .	210.52905
in the new style , the department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the russians .	98.49618
for three or four years in the mid-1950 ' s , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon .	61.971146
it became smart to say that the fault was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself .	193.59059
an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the senate ' s own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation .	59.89778
there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in washington .	11.997067
they range from the soviet embassy on sixteenth street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what congressman rooney has called `` that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street ' ' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the belgians .	50.612816
here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired lothario .	43.460644
into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies .	76.96516
here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner .	37.314194
out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington .	125.4604
some , like the british and the french , maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the american scene .	161.30705
other embassies cable home the new york times without changing a comma .	154.08092
the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage headquarters .	19.627447
when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over in 1957 from georgi zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea .	60.585865
menshikov hit washington with a tv announcer ' s grin and a hearty handclasp .	14.272185
to everyone ' s astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov .	89.85742
where his predecessors had glowered , menshikov smiled .	10.704417
where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers ' assistants , menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails .	95.54606
overnight he became the most available man in washington .	21.21332
speeches by the soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club alike .	169.96863
in senator joseph mccarthy ' s phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of .	76.349464
a newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked menshikov `` what should we call you ' ' ? ?	29.686113
and that menshikov replied `` just call me mike ' ' .	18.28798
`` smilin ' mike ' ' was the sobriquet washington gave him .	150.94986
his english was usable and he used it fearlessly .	589.17944
toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator ' s wife and gaily cried `` up your bottom ' ' ! !	46.740807
for a few giddy months that coincided with one of moscow ' s smiling moods , he was the sensation of washington .	40.023174
at the state department , hard-bitten russian experts complained that the capitol was out of its wits .	55.9253
newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that judas , too , had been able to smile .	47.157608
the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians usually end .	359.53943
finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics , moscow resumed scowling and `` smilin ' mike ' ' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west .	37.23486
the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs ' , and the most inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians .	29.924686
when king saud visited washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family .	68.94593
rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds .	48.615788
the state department was little help on this , or on much else about saudi arabia .	159.63771
a reporter who consulted a middle east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the arabian-american oil company .	137.92409
`` this is where i get my information from ' ' , he confided .	33.20768
it ' s the only copy i ' ve got ' ' .	4.9575086
the size of saud ' s family was still being debated when the king appeared for his first meeting with eisenhower .	88.54264
when it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into hagerty ' s office to report on the interview .	40.8886
the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american friendship to bore in on the central question .	157.67424
how many children did the king have ? ?	1.3241026
`` twenty-one ' ' , replied the sheik .	65.30183
and how many of these were sons ? ?	1.0352682
`` twenty-five ' ' , the sheik replied .	6.732362
`` do you mean to tell us ' ' , a reporter asked , `` that the king has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons ' ' ? ?	21.357985
the sheik smiled and murmured `` that is precisely correct ' ' .	46.37478
the egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language .	6.0552573
when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east peace after israel ' s 1956 invasion of egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo , a language as anarchic as casey stengel ' s .	101.30656
the reports of president nasser ' s pledges which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the israeli foreign minister , mrs . golda meir .	56.25478
finally he reported that nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli concessions .	104.49995
the deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside .	50.203583
i know now why our japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom .	75.63093
of course , most toilets are eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside .	163.74472
a few newer homes have western flush toilets , but even with running water , they are usually eastern style .	113.66932
the next day i visited international christian college which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know japan well .	97.07476
they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning .	57.9088
the library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom .	87.453064
spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be christian .	18.870127
they have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates .	117.65874
in the afternoon miss hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young mrs . kodama to see the famous spring dances of the geisha dancers .	58.581017
mrs . hosaka is one of the japanese women one reads about -- beautiful , artistically talented , an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a pampered , gentle japanese woman .	130.09886
the dances were as beautiful as anything i have ever seen -- they rival the new york rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination .	50.87512
because don was leaving the next day , i spent the evening with him at asia center .	141.66687
the following morning mr . morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- mr . yoshimoto ' s school .	35.508633
there is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected -- some think too much .	288.1775
there is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools .	36.07858
with the loss of the emperor diety in japan , the people are left in confusion with no god or moral teachings that have strength .	86.72025
the older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents .	99.6798
there seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability .	88.80187
as a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value .	62.150036
the government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused .	136.8268
i was told that it is quite likely that japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? ?	91.25146
it will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop .	166.4028
in the evening the former oregon state science teachers met for dinner at the new tokyo restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good .	94.064766
they suggested several new foods , and usually i found them good , except the sweets , which i think i could learn to like .	132.32127
six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun .	90.474266
after a day at nikko , mrs . kodama put me on the train for kyoto .	36.126858
my instructions were that mr . nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome .	73.99369
my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by masu and the japan travel bureau and were more elegant than i would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be elegant -- i did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their salaries are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well .	71.3273
they understood and teased me a bit about it .	11.021427
i think i would have been much disappointed in japan if i had not seen kyoto , nara , and hiroshima .	55.52682
kyoto is the ancient capital of japan and still its cultural center .	236.81618
it , along with nara , was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar japan .	47.399857
here i was accompanied by mrs . okamoto ( fumio ' s mother ) , her son , mr . washizu ( a prospective student with whom i have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and mr . nishima , one of the science teachers .	48.546814
i arrived at 7 00 a . m . and by 9 00 a . m . i had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned .	50.552227
we walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens .	34.376217
we visited the okamoto home -- where for the first time i saw the famous tea ceremony .	41.404938
at 6 00 p . m . we went to the kyoto spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated .	97.724464
they were even better than those of tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .	89.54138
after a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of mt . fuji ) , i returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day .	44.444794
we started at 9 a . m . to visit the kyoto university where mr . washizu is attending .	79.3118
i was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school .	88.8366
they apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and i was a little at a loss to know what to say .	86.420235
i don ' t have the answer yet .	6.4088354
we had tea at mr . washizu ' s home where i learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family .	38.17048
and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest .	40.850304
this is a significant fact in japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice .	25.318531
in his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big .	102.20634
also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc . .	33.37155
he had displayed more of them than usual so that i could enjoy them .	143.53404
about 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum .	45.393414
the house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older , less-hurried times .	79.18524
mr . nishima went with me on the train to nara .	40.4984
we passed his house and school on the way .	20.409477
in nara i stayed at the hotel where the prince and princess had stayed on their honeymoon .	34.078552
a new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but i walked on it , too .	37.063557
here mr . yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches .	35.21851
even though we had walked miles in kyoto that day , we started out again to see nara at night .	59.586586
in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to osaka to put me on the train for hiroshima .	69.84652
again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn ' t let me .	18.189741
at osaka , mr . yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home , but mr . nishima and i had an hour and a half before train time to see osaka at night .	45.451195
it is the second largest city in japan , with about four million people .	63.63162
one spot in osaka i shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river .	68.27272
in the midst of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light .	127.82964
my train arrived in hiroshima at the awful hour of 4 45 a . m . .	22.746393
i had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which mr . uno would arrive and pilot me around .	131.08511
but there he was at the train with an oregon state pennant in his hand .	151.63652
i know now why the students insisted that i go to hiroshima even when i told them i didn ' t want to .	48.904884
they knew that i was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if i could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret pearl harbor , i would be happier and would understand better a new japan .	75.9151
there were no words to say this but there was no need .	32.62554
the teachers of mr . uno ' s school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming .	86.39662
hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace and understanding .	72.35332
i was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience .	59.578373
a better world may yet come out of hiroshima .	204.95161
on arriving in tokyo later we were met by masu who took us immediately to her university , the japanese women ' s university .	79.559326
this day was `` open house for parents ' ' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables .	90.32736
everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun .	41.765083
it was thrilling to see the effect of an american-trained teacher on japanese students in a class in home planning .	110.40821
our masu is one of the very few architects in japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women ' s needs .	165.91988
i am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants .	51.546394
many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american homes , but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using japanese artfulness in our own western architecture at the same time that the japanese are adopting western utility patterns .	93.28851
at this women ' s university we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that japanese women also should be educated .	103.703094
even today there are some doubts about the value of education for japanese women , but this university continues to grow and to send its students out into the community .	63.380157
active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings .	69.60222
as far as i am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions .	147.58867
masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for japanese widows in tokyo .	34.165432
here the women learn to keep house as maids	14610.039
they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests .	160.89758
they learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family .	30.981703
they have model kitchens , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a nursery with a life-like doll .	49.50954
although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough .	38.87366
graduates of this maid ' s school are much in demand and can always find work immediately .	295.86697
masu ' s home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials .	247.64085
masu also uses the training she got in an american home where she learned to polish furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a shiny house .	110.219536
her education in the united states , not just in a classroom , but also in an american house with an american housekeeper , stands her in good stead .	64.884964
after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria , the kitchen of which masu had planned , mr . washizu and i left to meet representatives of the usis for a visit to the university of tokyo .	83.23556
here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could not see , but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant .	84.2135
the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between attorney general rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be applauded .	117.215065
but for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case .	75.48814
the suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the south , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in new york and general company policy .	94.62719
then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one .	49.10264
it would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which , for love ' s sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , indivisible from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy .	56.577995
perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation .	63.43773
such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification .	84.46434
action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate .	144.77925
moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-civil war south , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) .	112.22028
in any case , anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by white citizens ' councils in the entire state of mississippi against every local philco dealer in that state , in protest against a philco-sponsored program over a national tv network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a `` high yellow gal ' ' smooching with a white man .	105.14433
it is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different .	54.47534
but since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force .	118.296455
the need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that white citizens ' councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence .	94.53027
an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means .	143.88608
the end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e . g . , against negroes who register to vote in fayette county , tennessee , at the present moment .	65.84742
here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies .	146.0017
this , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used .	111.20011
it is also sufficient to show the christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i . e . , that , if economic pressure has to be resorted to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them .	112.324196
it is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian morality , like any other form of resistance .	89.203476
the language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) .	77.87161
one of the sit-in leaders has said `` nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom of hell can stop the march to freedom .	144.88306
everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them ' ' .	137.78165
the present writer certainly agrees with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice .	40.5554
however , it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward .	78.04161
and when charity interpenetrates man ' s struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will .	96.58884
it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means .	73.40579
r . b . gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance .	106.763756
he suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him ' '	136.17645
and again , that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope .	82.78181
in another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values ' ' .	62.771854
a trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent	73.99123
and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause .	54.28276
this makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified .	91.07453
the question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him .	37.203453
here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives	163.71153
and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently .	78.97024
a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression .	215.65637
among christian groups , the mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the christian use of all forms of pressure .	55.7684
since the will and word of god are for them concentrated in christ-like love , it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing .	71.22456
`` the primary objective of non-violence ' ' , writes the outstanding mennonite ethicist , `` is not peace , or obedience to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage ' ' .	81.51623
without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the mennonite position and affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance .	115.56218
economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified	107.16629
and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action .	128.81404
economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed .	75.87768
that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals .	109.33431
there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent .	33.088688
the justification in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good .	162.89001
in these terms , the `` economic withdrawal ' ' of the negroes of nashville , tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out .	65.18733
we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above .	210.20555
there may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people .	46.528744
an excellent article was published recently in the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in south africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the united states in these conditions .	50.801838
`` billions of american dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of u . s . taxpayers ' ' , this author states , `` are being poured into south africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white ' ' .	83.144684
both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail .	25.681717
this leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is inescapable that america does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue ' ' .	138.97754
our leadership in a wide economic boycott of south africa would be not only in accord , it seems , with the moral conscience of america , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in accord with our law , u . s . code title 19 , section 1307 , which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor .	58.428253
not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every american who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation ' ' .	82.4584
northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .	42.225494
they have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .	51.533146
and both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners who are called bourbons .	133.87103
the name presumably derives from the french royal house which never learned and never forgot	140.69235
since bourbon whiskey , though of kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the north as by conservatives in the south .	37.62797
the nature of the opposition between liberals and bourbons is too little understood in the north .	50.65064
the race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .	193.27959
it is these other differences between north and south -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which i chiefly discuss herein .	225.44505
i write about northern liberals from considerable personal experience .	9.574413
a southerner married to a new englander , i have lived for many years in a connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .	66.76965
most of them are democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .	246.90182
this is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government .	93.864075
yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view jefferson as one of their patron saints .	57.836662
when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , i find that they fall into two categories the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis	120.451866
and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don ' t count any more in the world of to-day .	32.579697
i am naive , they say , to make use of such words .	66.24029
i take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? ?	135.07639
-- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it .	123.09411
this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a president of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court .	59.530582
as for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .	103.44686
the american liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case	96.11832
but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .	44.810886
why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ? ?	139.93884
if he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? ?	56.552563
and if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? ?	150.07112
i am concerned here , however , with the northern liberal ' s attitude toward the south .	35.08589
it appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friends .	55.192028
his assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .	131.97333
time ' s editor , thomas griffith , in his book , the waist-high culture , wrote `` most of what was different about it ( the deep south ) i found myself unsympathetic to .	80.06351
' ' this , for the liberals i know , would be an understatement .	27.041605
theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against fascism .	82.7987
i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the north .	49.041264
in business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found .	64.828125
but in our case -- and neither my wife nor i have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more .	153.63062
in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .	124.48822
accounts have been published of northern liberals in the south up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .	76.1594
but these accounts do not show that northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings .	41.9705
from my wife ' s experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles .	74.06609
but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the south , especially among those who studied in the north .	57.2701
and social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting northerners .	122.37263
also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problems .	556.2233
but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven ' t .	62.695576
my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war .	64.66888
nobody knows how many southerners there are in this category .	13.866814
i suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the north likes to believe .	88.46516
i never heard of a poll being taken on the question .	19.874872
no doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .	74.467896
prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerners would have voted against the confederacy .	28.141878
since the supreme court ' s decision of that year this is more doubtful	183.53139
and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to little rock i believe the majority would have been for the old south .	89.759834
belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .	84.24203
probably a larger percentage of virginians and south carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with georgia , north carolina , and alabama following along after them .	101.31323
old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont	484.81403
so that a line running down the length of the south marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the old south from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .	69.48619
the long-settled areas of states like virginia and south carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .	85.541954
also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on charleston had closer ties with england and the west indies than with the north even after independence .	94.85198
the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .	31.763662
in certain respects defeat increased the persistent anglophilia of the old south .	14.560995
poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .	95.89536
and no doubt many people in states like the carolinas and georgia , which were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the crown .	55.213478
among bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .	150.27678
but many historians maintain that except for northern meddling it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did .	87.00887
southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and reconstruction	135.50764
their fears now are of miscegenation and negro political control in many counties .	111.01293
but apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed south -- to use the moderate words favored by mr . thomas griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the north .	108.956314
and this , in effect , means most of modern america .	44.87239
it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .	45.007385
and therein , i feel , many northerners delude themselves about the south .	25.265793
for one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed .	421.99316
there seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .	43.42577
i suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking don ' t talk about the final stages of reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .	47.572624
or else the north really believes that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the american dream , like everybody else .	75.86683
if the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .	33.289307
the situation of the south since 1865 has been unique in the western world .	29.505552
regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre-world-war- 1 great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .	175.32188
and the great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or celtic descent .	38.07822
this is the only case in modern history of a people of britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .	132.2186
the fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .	73.343864
in every war of the united states since the civil war the south was more belligerent than the rest of the country .	14.294969
so instead of being tests of the south ' s loyalty , the spanish war , the two world wars , and the korean war all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion .	71.31244
and there is no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold war against communism .	47.660393
had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , england been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to new england , there is little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain .	78.05281
it is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as southerners should have been as docile as they have .	51.856964
the north should thank its stars that such has been the case	76.10041
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .	124.42995
the two main charges levelled against the bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .	58.000854
there is much truth in both these charges , and not many bourbons deny them .	48.512875
whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .	7.713247
most of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .	81.00993
many northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .	117.313194
the bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of northern conservatives .	46.05038
but those among the bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .	703.2861
they believe that if the south had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern america .	132.08559
as it is , they consider that the north is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` american way ' ' has been proved inferior to the english and scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .	82.82144
the south ' s antipathy to northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .	80.5854
their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to southerners	255.94763
and i have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .	140.09387
in the past , the duties of the state , as sir henry maine noted long ago , were only two in number internal order and external security .	207.76213
by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders .	66.04644
outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior ' ' peoples of the non-western world , a position of dominance .	47.390995
it became the sole `` subject ' ' of `` international law ' ' ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world arena .	60.460846
( that corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .	36.345028
speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the western powers .	87.41499
the enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era .	54.24433
beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .	96.91164
this was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires .	40.787415
that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .	120.89614
his duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated .	64.56165
thus , to cite but one example , the pax britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the british navy ruling the seas or with the city of london ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e . g . , the united states ) may have incidentally benefited .	103.94003
at the same time , all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted .	125.97576
social darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century .	97.52462
however , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity .	149.64096
a concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .	83.685196
already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters .	84.01384
a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned an important corner .	151.01234
in what has aptly been called a `` constitutional revolution ' ' , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` night-watchman state ' ' ) to one with affirmative duties to perform .	96.678505
the `` positive state ' ' came into existence .	48.278004
for lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the supreme court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in `` the switch in time that saved nine ' ' , president roosevelt ' s ill-starred but in effect victorious `` court-packing plan ' ' , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation .	83.88711
of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the american people .	76.65472
labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms , and all the many facets of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom .	59.2355
a national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary .	69.17312
ratified in the republican party victory in 1952 , the positive state is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be .	133.12999
the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i . e . , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the american people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in american constitutional history .	48.87
the other , of course , was the civil war , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation .	124.09842
a third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed american immersion and involvement in world affairs .	87.7173
internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented .	115.40337
nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept .	126.935715
thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces ' ' to operate and cure the distress .	94.509186
that guiding principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege guns of the new deal	73.630295
less than a score of years later congress enacted the employment act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment .	69.266594
hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution .	196.28586
in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state ' s-responsibility ' ' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus .	120.9759
the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .	45.662075
internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the industrial revolution .	22.330484
reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era .	28.16963
national responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or even to the western nations .	30.922298
a measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the international congress of jurists in 1959 .	54.625233
meeting in new delhi under the auspices of the international commission of jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the congress redefined and expanded the traditional rule of law to include affirmative governmental duties .	70.03471
it is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations .	129.83084
the rule of law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court ' ' before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare .	94.77146
recognizing that the rule of law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society ' ' , the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized ' ' .	59.84813
the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-soviet world .	38.632523
for better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .	89.75276
whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation ' s external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish .	55.31929
the hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .	69.709435
the content is not the same , however rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group ' ' -- those in the `` free world ' ' -- that is basic .	48.458996
external national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations .	83.2081
if internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .	103.49206
reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .	44.948395
in its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the church .	89.86385
the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .	53.856964
( since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the united states as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging .	57.725628
) the concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure .	57.92407
for it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit .	94.43981
today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world .	53.928413
almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .	61.877544
historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the western civilizational group .	78.43909
by subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty .	70.079475
within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied .	155.99341
while the pattern is uneven , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the western peoples well .	190.41022
( whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today ' s nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions .	99.062386
it is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) .	77.22101
but it is more than irony one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet .	73.03483
in other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population	216.78513
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .	14.903954
complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty .	25.388626
the former receives its legitimacy from the latter .	13.425618
operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state .	232.48181
while sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern .	170.18346
jean bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood .	57.24386
austin ' s nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today ' s legal and political thinking .	110.1465
to him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the english monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i . e . , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations .	57.01658
these fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .	113.31064
the nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control .	177.16374
in fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined .	56.830868
high-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .	120.71055
that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular ' ' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .	72.589066
nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .	88.7829
is there a different reality behind the facade ? ?	18.521315
does the surface hide a quite different picture ? ?	12.8233795
the short answer to those questions is `` yes ' ' .	5.9864163
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .	29.239527
as evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances .	43.95064
can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ?	17.645063
what steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ?	79.3376
are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ?	93.21039
is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ?	22.280355
i have just asked these questions in the pentagon , in the white house , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` sherwood forest ' ' .	66.90405
i asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons ' ' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons .	92.53566
to the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow ' s impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .	58.210648
there is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .	67.39137
`` readiness exercises ' ' are almost continuous .	14.451308
in the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since `` e hour ' ' .	82.369896
`` e ' ' stands for `` execution ' ' -- the moment a `` go order ' ' would unleash an american nuclear strike .	66.766624
there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks .	83.43624
they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines .	109.88143
they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .	70.42777
accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks .	79.17471
among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware ' ' , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man ' s flair for what the professionals in this field call `` scenarios ' ' .	62.88666
as an air force psychiatrist put it `` you can ' t have dry runs on this one ' ' .	30.095778
the experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might .	225.14008
only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men the more highly placed they are -- that is , the more they know -- the more concerned they have become .	144.49538
already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security .	71.91707
only recently new `` holes ' ' were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more .	123.298065
work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons .	72.28136
meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by `` false pre-emption ' ' , `` escalation ' ' , `` unauthorized behavior ' ' and other terms that will be discussed in this report .	20.129948
they inhabit a secret world centered on `` go codes ' ' and `` gold phones ' ' .	13.803955
their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions .	52.402016
one arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs ' ' .	58.48208
yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me -- and the experts .	106.40692
it is their job to think about the unthinkable .	308.26813
unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more russians and communist chinese , too -- thought about accidental war .	123.024635
the first systematic thinking about this pandora ' s box within pandora ' s boxes was done four years ago by fred ikle , a frail , meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist .	38.53087
he was , and is , with the rand corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the u . s . air force .	25.733551
his investigations made him the paul revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased .	118.7552
in recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the kennedy administration , basic united states strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible .	78.996864
the chain starts at bmews ( ballistic missile early warning system ) in thule , greenland .	120.34927
its radar screens would register soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states .	17.7176
bmews intelligence is simultaneously flashed to norad ( north american air defense command ) in colorado springs , colorado , for interpretation	73.52174
to the sac command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base , near omaha , nebraska	44.738018
to the joint war room of the joint chiefs of staff in the pentagon and to the president .	13.408089
telephones , teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points .	111.502754
alternate locations exist for all key command centers .	4.515924
for last-ditch emergencies sac has alternate command posts on kc-135 jet tankers .	16.108145
multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .	76.524994
the same principle of `` redundancy ' ' applies to all communications on these special networks .	108.39707
and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources .	53.551212
additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications .	36.20726
only the president is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons .	11.302948
but what if somebody decides to break it ? ?	11.518515
the president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger .	106.81391
hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons .	27.982363
what if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the russians ? ?	110.42933
what if the president himself , in the language of the military , `` goes ape ' ' ? ?	39.772694
or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets without provocation ? ?	73.5913
nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .	7.1309905
however , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war .	39.083588
even the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a `` go ' ' order .	54.30352
even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the `` go code ' ' .	55.237732
in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` gold-phone circuit ' ' .	21.999651
a system of `` gold ' ' -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the secretary of defense , the joint chiefs of staff , the sac commander and other key men .	53.520546
all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes .	78.98775
all could help the president make his decision .	5.6669292
the talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble .	141.11464
vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda .	159.51292
officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the president ' s decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from aj .	84.43755
if communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order .	360.1154
for these centers , too , are on the gold circuit .	26.809132
they include the navy ' s atlantic command at norfolk , virginia , which is in contact with the polaris subs	29.046602
air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases	126.91981
and sac , which controls long-range bombers and atlas missiles .	13.961355
let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- sac at omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their aj .	161.77129
the key man almost certainly would be col . william w . wisman , sac ' s senior controller .	30.143106
he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day .	88.16385
it is a quiet but impressive room -- 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high .	38.491974
movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information .	166.34511
and bill wisman , forty-three , a farmer ' s son from beallsville , ohio , is a quiet but impressive man .	34.91355
his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .	181.54814
his movements and speech are precise , clear and quick .	98.79322
no question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .	118.254776
wisman , who has had the chief controller ' s job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .	58.24063
at least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him .	70.64784
in front of him is a gold phone .	4.306852
in emergencies the sac commander , gen . thomas power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman and his staff .	124.393036
at general power ' s seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .	41.48696
general power would participate in the decision making .	12.792696
wisman , below , would listen in and act .	353.92172
his consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every sac aircraft .	73.35803
he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert .	278.69644
( there are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .	159.01057
but wisman , too , does not know the go code .	124.07345
he must take it from `` the red box ' ' .	12.606314
in point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to wisman ' s right .	59.737278
the box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( `` it ' s real obnoxious ' ' ) .	34.168385
now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation ' s most guarded secrets .	39.054264
the codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed x-ray-proof `` unique device ' ' .	106.56637
they are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by wisman or his staff , at random intervals .	94.59818
but even the contents of wisman ' s box cannot start a war .	188.18523
they are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .	81.683426
what these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .	233.5625
the pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by wisman ' s staff .	43.372803
in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator ' ' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .	82.685
i asked wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .	117.31974
`` i ' d wind up full of bullet holes ' ' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .	23.75978
now let us imagine a wing of b-52 ' s , on alert near their `` positive control ( or fail-safe ) points ' ' , the spots on the map , many miles from soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets .	100.37172
they , too , have fragments of the go code with them .	173.66328
as wisman put it , `` they have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie .	34.496513
once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it .	66.71685
unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing ' ' .	135.98477
why does wisman ' s ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ?	38.63462
at any rate , three men out of a six-man b-52 crew are required to copy down wisman ' s go-to-war message .	90.59851
each must match wisman ' s `` pie ' ' with the fragment that he carries with him .	24.497965
all three must compare notes and agree to `` go ' ' .	28.201786
after that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .	134.74219
unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done .	141.5886
suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended .	173.77155
they went as rigid as black statuary six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still .	134.48987
they all swung at the same instant in the same direction .	27.978888
they saw it before i did , even with my binoculars .	71.5171
it was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth .	43.005352
in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more .	160.22997
a white man would not have seen it .	48.20792
the aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .	49.83531
watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land .	67.93107
at once the whole band set off at a lope .	14.085577
they went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .	77.90608
i followed them in the jeep and now they did not care .	50.048435
the games were over , this was life .	22.671995
occasionally , for no reason that i could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot .	67.568535
sometimes i guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .	101.949036
their gait is impossible to convey in words .	2.8433921
it has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve .	47.550556
it is the gait of the human who must run to live arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful .	99.81278
it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .	47.11077
finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall .	19.69665
for ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering .	33.145885
then the wind died and the rain squall held steady .	131.21588
suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground .	33.47498
he had found a depression with rain water in it .	38.82392
he bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground .	19.15506
with a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows .	89.17911
the other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle .	28.726547
in an instant he had sucked it dry .	2.2316291
the aborigine lives on the cruelest land i have ever seen .	11.322076
which does not mean that it is ugly .	2.1300726
there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous .	93.601974
they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand .	107.99928
but much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable .	43.27287
it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .	172.30452
the malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the australian charles bean .	81.7809
he tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer .	39.252922
they went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback ' ' country .	16.58488
the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps .	57.966846
nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men .	3.4406612
there might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps only -- there was not .	156.63568
there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise	237.3182
they lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them .	107.15316
even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .	128.77321
he knows that the land is hard and pitiless .	15.6755495
he knows that the economy of life in the `` outback ' ' is awful .	15.14817
there is no room for error or waste .	30.013367
any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done .	64.82151
i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but i suspect that it can .	33.84771
perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity .	392.59903
seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing .	5.9594045
many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports .	16.83218
others are confined to vast reservations , and not only does the australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed .	127.91806
i persuaded an australian friend who had lived `` outback ' ' for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush .	66.14238
it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation , even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language .	69.68211
finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a land rover .	50.27333
we followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth .	68.604576
the rancher went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road .	50.534973
at once he started to glance toward the instrument panel .	613.3231
it took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel there was a gimbaled compass welded to it , which rocked gently back and forth as the land rover bounced about .	89.476295
the rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .	43.306984
`` do you always navigate like this ' ' ? ?	2.4474676
`` damned right ' ' , he said .	2.088225
`` once i get out on the flat i do .	66.219475
some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks , a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there .	151.75433
but if you don ' t know the place like the palm of your hand , you ' d better use a compass and the speedometer .	80.83883
two miles northeast , then five miles southwest that sort of thing .	225.827
i would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless .	72.086365
finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .	13.761027
they were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder a man , his lubra , and two children .	58.042072
the sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder .	67.041016
there was also a dog , a dingo dog .	23.44864
its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches .	66.79255
it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully .	148.807
it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .	29.937304
`` the buggers love shade ' ' , the rancher said .	47.587112
`` i suppose because it saves them some loss of body water .	279.67972
they ' ll move around that rock all day , following the shade .	117.651886
during the hottest part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there isn ' t any shade ' ' .	33.361774
we drove close to the boulder , stopped the land rover , and walked over toward the family .	34.123146
he gazed away from us as we approached .	194.99017
he was over six feet tall and very thin .	9.326242
every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving .	24.833326
he had long black hair and a wispy beard .	14.54181
the ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .	170.50665
there was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .	62.30739
it was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets .	49.741978
a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man ' s lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink .	28.943495
the australian and i both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .	114.59712
she remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there	244.69589
like the man , she was entirely naked .	11.982387
her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her .	54.105766
there were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent .	58.264633
there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy .	40.916546
there was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .	73.60495
everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless .	39.752293
the two children , both boys , wandered around the australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work .	85.42294
they squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground .	79.37358
they had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and pinched them dead .	57.03268
the tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple .	73.54426
the odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines .	162.15164
the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .	119.90602
it was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed .	50.47249
one ' s impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant .	38.608643
but that is a cliche and a dishonest one .	16.538921
the smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it .	133.33894
their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .	61.482346
they roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it .	96.387505
in spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and i realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared	85.01451
as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic .	24.423498
the boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .	137.35808
`` that smell is something , eh , mate ' ' ? ?	32.350185
`` they swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other .	84.37155
at the corroborees , when they get to dancing and sweating , you ' ll see them rubbing up against a man who ' s supposed to have a specially good smell .	55.126663
idje , here ' ' , and he nodded at the man , `` is said to have great odor .	72.61137
the stink is all the same to me , but i really think they can make one another out blindfolded ' ' .	60.75829
`` here , idje , you fella like tabac ' ' ? ?	5.5727754
idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .	40.083992
the australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin i could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest .	181.751
it was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in persian art .	53.402397
the architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through abbas ' s reign and those of his successors to enrich the city .	58.789608
travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .	68.89916
at the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be `` as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a market as any in the universe ' ' .	89.61135
in time isfahan came to be known as `` half the world ' ' , isfahan nisf-i-jahan .	26.521862
in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of london , started to decline .	102.96798
isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old persia and sometimes of the east .	93.10888
they think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor .	239.24178
those who actually get there find that it isn ' t spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .	76.15494
but even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which persia lies well preserved but indeed dead .	100.27949
everyone is ready to grant the persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .	65.16595
it seems that for persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present .	84.50961
the one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called `` historical monuments ' ' .	105.772255
however , just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared .	124.75236
the values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes .	84.4676
often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply `` historical monuments ' '	48.366184
the promenade , for example , continues to take place on the chahar bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city ' s principal street .	29.08326
it takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square .	27.681532
on fridays , the day when many persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into chehel sotun -- a pavilion and garden built by shah abbas 2 , in the seventeenth century -- but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former .	52.55992
and of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar .	79.32167
those three other great activities of the persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of persian domestic architecture long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches .	83.5515
but more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities .	89.90243
water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness .	64.02311
i should like , by the way , to make it clear that i am not using the word `` persians ' ' carelessly .	30.876793
i don ' t mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool .	128.83954
these things are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary .	62.553524
the men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer ' s night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses .	58.1786
a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor .	101.13898
not long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks .	69.55381
the air , he said , was just right	228.79677
i really didn ' t know what he meant .	44.8039
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .	146.90907
the natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of persians a great deal of attention .	72.55498
the line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from hafiz , the purity of spring water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion -- these things are noticed , judged , and valued .	93.509544
nowhere in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge .	45.73067
there has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city .	40.81115
for one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed	399.24808
for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in .	54.305298
it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that shah abbas 2 , in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge .	47.725876
from upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river	82.95575
from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .	23.374947
the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .	28.508535
at either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses .	121.73429
here , in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between .	92.56589
below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge .	44.5387
these are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .	89.217476
down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools .	73.52431
here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults .	38.024006
on the downstream , or `` pavilion ' ' , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself .	136.26823
from the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river .	94.43827
out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge .	113.598495
on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge .	55.984695
the bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera .	92.84199
crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege .	99.355125
all kinds come to walk in the promenade merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal	212.47964
a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket	29.685547
dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions	69.23952
the old kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines	3.4830284
students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns .	9.074498
families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar .	101.17733
below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river .	104.57192
above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance .	39.810528
here in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face .	95.185
to a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for persians chase the golden calf as much as any people .	149.7633
many of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant .	58.838627
nonetheless , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks .	136.64099
above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry .	87.02351
poetry in persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand .	103.50233
it contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life .	189.4336
and it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form .	40.12974
poetry for a persian is nothing less than truth and beauty .	102.71082
in most western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .	45.095818
in persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for that matter , hardly any books , the twins run free .	188.17778
it is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on london bridge the teddy boys of the east end will gather to sing marlowe , herrick , shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .	117.25682
that , at any rate , is what happens at the khaju bridge .	66.98976
boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .	36.96233
here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which persian music is divided .	123.387344
each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .	132.46408
the singer simply matches the poem to a mode	733.99426
for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem `` they brought me news that spring is in the plains and ahmad ' s blood the crimson tulip stains	131.90771
go , tell his aged mother that her son fought with a thousand foes , and he was one ' ' .	47.12404
or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet `` know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth , that here , with dust upon his eyes , iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .	135.63947
in this true lover ' s tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred .	36.44889
these songs ( practically all persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves .	103.198456
yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque .	92.36114
die frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben jahr , the maestro quoted the flying dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times .	59.999973
the music director of the pittsburgh symphony orchestra , william steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life .	87.08271
when he added to his pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the london philharmonic orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting ' ' between the two cities .	60.855076
this schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious mr . steinberg .	112.17808
his london contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , `` i conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts ' ' ! !	53.521946
our meeting took place in may , 1961 , during one of the maestro ' s stop-overs in new york , before he left for europe .	36.87052
as we began to converse in the lounge of his fifth avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .	98.471954
seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off .	108.5009
unfortunately , it was muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured .	56.557095
as he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled .	158.81773
did he come from a musical family ? ?	1.0156382
yes though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family .	45.761864
in his native cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet .	47.8949
she even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values .	399.33395
when he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter a , instead of c , as in the scale .	61.120472
because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing czerny etudes , he composed his own studies .	47.48554
when he was eight he began violin lessons .	13.261118
soon he was playing in the cologne municipal orchestra , and during world war 1 , , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well .	53.851135
steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .	69.101746
`` by observing the conductor ' ' , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , `` i learned how not to conduct ' ' .	30.135426
the musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the gymnasium .	52.05891
simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano .	62.283623
he became otto klemperer ' s personal assistant at the cologne opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor .	40.502525
wasn ' t this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? ?	98.13136
had he always wished to be a conductor ? ?	39.333073
no , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such .	190.10712
however , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist .	44.156334
five years were spent with the cologne opera , after which he was called to prague by alexander von zemlinsky , teacher of arnold schonberg and erich korngold .	40.47755
in 1927 he succeeded zemlinsky as opera director of the german theater at prague .	41.56815
during his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the berlin state opera .	55.257835
two years later he became director of the frankfurt opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the hitler regime .	81.819626
during these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in germany .	57.776104
he had presented the first german performances of puccini ' s manon lescaut and de falla ' s la vida breve .	10.581488
the frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of berg ' s wozzek soon after the berlin premiere under erich kleiber , and the world premiere of schonberg ' s von heute auf morgen .	27.984066
at the outset of his career , steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a schonberg work every year .	58.024033
in frankfurt , too , he directed the museum and opera house concerts which , in addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like erdmann ' s piano concerto and mahler ' s sixth symphony .	23.35312
because of the political upheaval in germany in the 1930 ' s , steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the jewish community .	42.916172
through the frankfurt jewish kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with cellist emanuel feuermann .	27.34239
as more and more jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations steinberg united them into the frankfurt kulturbund orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other german cities .	94.95321
in 1936 he accepted the leadership of the berlin kulturbund .	74.76477
in the fall of that year the best musicians of the berlin and frankfurt kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of bronislaw hubermann and steinberg to become the palestine orchestra -- now known as the israel philharmonic orchestra -- with steinberg as founder-conductor .	96.74491
in 1938 , at the insistence of arturo toscanini , steinberg left germany for the united states , by way of switzerland .	42.9695
after he had spent the first three years in new york as associate conductor , at toscanini ' s invitation , of the nbc orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the united states and latin america .	36.911026
in 1945 he became conductor of the buffalo philharmonic .	13.06202
seven years later he was asked to become director of the pittsburgh symphony .	22.929497
since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the san francisco opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of verdi ' s falstaff .	17.375872
in recent years he has traveled widely in europe , conducting in italy , france , austria , and switzerland .	28.010565
he returned to germany for the first time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in cologne , frankfurt , and berlin .	49.831795
where in europe was he going now ? ?	1.1052164
first of all , to italy for a short vacation -- forte dei marmi , a place he loves .	74.930084
since it is not far from viareggio , he will visit puccini ' s house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of la boheme , which he considers one of puccini ' s masterpieces .	39.741413
steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about italy `` rome is my second home .	153.31593
i consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year ' ' .	53.566566
he will conduct two concerts at the accademia di santa cecilia , as well as concerts in munich and cologne .	16.499489
`` then i return to the united states for engagements at the hollywood bowl and in philadelphia ' ' , he added .	45.338974
the forthcoming season in pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest .	51.789772
there will be premieres of new works , made possible through ford foundation commissions carlisle floyd ' s mystery , with phyllis curtin as soprano soloist .	110.7819
other world premieres will be gardner read ' s third symphony and burle marx ' s samba concertante .	15.13158
`` and next year we will do -- also a ford commission -- a piano concerto by elliott carter , with jacob lateiner as soloist .	71.05739
of course , i shall conduct mahler and bruckner works in the coming season , as usual .	63.408783
we ' ll play bruckner ' s fifth symphony in the original version , and mahler ' s seventh -- the least accessible , known , and played of mahler ' s works .	42.975414
my pittsburghers have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner ' ' .	6.4551077
he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour , especially mahler ' s first and fourth symphonies , and das lied von der erde , and bruckner ' s sixth -- which is rarely played -- and seventh .	62.873165
bruckner ' s eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony ' ' .	46.912125
he recalled that in california after a critic had attacked him for `` still trying to sell bruckner to the americans ' ' , the public ' s response at the next concert was a standing ovation .	60.738243
`` now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us , i am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of leonard bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner and mahler ' ' .	81.498116
since he introduces so much modern music , i could not resist asking how he felt about it .	68.01359
`` there was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created .	87.95495
but i usually stick to the old phrase ' ich habe ein amt , aber keine meinung ( i hold an office , but i do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) .	32.493435
i consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today ' ' .	55.16419
with all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?	20.768074
he had just paid a brief visit to the frick collection to admire his favorite paintings by rembrandt and franz hals .	45.76472
he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired claude lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a poussin exhibit he had been able to see in paris a year ago .	43.740253
and how did he feel about modern art ? ?	7.0158515
again steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .	72.05708
`` as my wife puts it ' ' , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , `` all you know is your music .	30.124334
but after all , you never learned anything else ' ' ! !	8.022169
like his late colleague , mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular sir arthur conan doyle .	40.974785
he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature .	87.18234
but his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son .	63.94863
at the moment he was excited about his son ' s having received the prix de rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an etruscan tomb .	71.85017
`` both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement ' ' .	31.987986
`` is the attitude of german youth comparable to that of `` the angry young men ' of england ' ' ? ?	31.564663
was the topic for a round-table discussion at the bayerische rundfunk in munich .	11.723634
i was chairman , the only not youthful participant .	7.713339
since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , i added to my opening statement a sentence in which i claimed that german youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry .	113.37436
i was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly .	160.7998
`` it is easy for you to talk ' '	5.8715725
countered a twenty year old law student , `` you travel around the world .	35.519352
we would like to do that too ' ' .	1.7367418
`` but you want a job guaranteed when you return ' ' , i continued my attack .	56.59535
`` you must have some security ' ' , said a young clerk .	33.296272
when i mentioned that for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly .	62.59577
one girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .	10.731333
`` would you advise us to act the same way ? ?	20.466146
i think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck ' ' .	38.530003
others mentioned that i might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding .	126.798645
the debate needed no additional controversy and soon i could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .	210.86642
though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .	76.602936
what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country .	21.307352
the ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children .	65.115166
no one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory .	308.95135
all expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .	127.17843
once again , as in the days of the founding fathers , america faces a stern test .	92.15688
that test , as president kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his state of the union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure ' ' .	75.41201
it is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril ' ' and of `` national opportunity ' ' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation .	56.221878
incapable of self-delusion , the founding fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty .	66.46968
seven founders -- george washington , benjamin franklin , john adams , thomas jefferson , alexander hamilton , james madison and john jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation .	35.171158
in certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way .	67.77373
as madison commented to jefferson in 1789 , `` we are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us .	69.19674
our successors will have an easier task ' ' .	1.5856328
they thought of themselves , to use jefferson ' s words , as `` the argonauts ' ' who had lived in `` the heroic age ' ' .	19.303562
accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity .	185.3466
their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved ' ' .	125.262184
strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the founding seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .	56.737152
even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning american independence and founding a new nation .	128.70084
before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .	99.28896
certainly no other seven american statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years .	155.91301
eldest of the seven , benjamin franklin , a new englander transplanted to philadelphia , wrote the most dazzling success story in our history .	44.316025
the young printer ' s apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman .	45.983765
author of the albany plan of union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the revolution , he fought the colonists ' front-line battles in london , negotiated the treaty of alliance with france and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the federal convention .	61.682587
on a military mission for his native virginia the youthful george washington touched off the french and indian war , then guarded his colony ' s frontier as head of its militia .	147.32451
commanding the continental army for six long years of the revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory .	33.968266
retiring to his beloved mount vernon , he returned to preside over the federal convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected president .	69.23813
during his two terms the constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fixed .	140.91687
john adams fashioned much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of massachusetts , negotiated , with franklin and jay , the peace with britain and served as our first vice president and our second president .	80.44254
his political opponent and lifetime friend , thomas jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the declaration of independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the louisiana territory during his first term as president .	62.58795
during the greater part of jefferson ' s career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow virginian , james madison , eight years his junior .	116.14866
the active sponsor of jefferson ' s measure for religious liberty in virginia , madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the constitution and in securing its ratification in virginia , founded the first political party in american history , and , as jefferson ' s secretary of state and his successor in the presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with britain .	63.4958
if franklin was an authentic genius , then alexander hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy .	62.738277
his revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders .	101.151474
principal author of `` the federalist ' ' , he swung new york over from opposition to the constitution to ratification almost single-handedly .	185.69566
his collaboration with washington , begun when he was the general ' s aide during the revolution , was resumed when he entered the first cabinet as secretary of the treasury .	30.564081
his bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions .	58.21073
less dazzling than hamilton , less eloquent than jefferson , john jay commands an equally high rank among the founding fathers .	132.39114
he served as president of the continental congress .	2.518185
he played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with great britain that ended the revolution , and directed america ' s foreign affairs throughout the confederation period .	70.914
as first chief justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated john marshall .	253.43639
he ended his public career as a two-term governor of new york .	8.480458
these seven founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed .	88.23623
their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with washington , jefferson and jay	109.28001
in others by business and professional acumen , as with franklin and adams , or , in hamilton ' s case , by an influential marriage .	73.04601
unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the revolution started .	138.4612
as different physically as the tall , angular jefferson was from the chubby , rotund adams , the seven were striking individualists .	54.945614
ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking .	58.655476
capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens .	30.541515
john adams dismissed john dickinson , who voted against the declaration of independence , as `` a certain great fortune and piddling genius ' ' .	29.382807
washington castigated his critic , general conway , as being capable of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity ' ' .	54.31681
and hamilton , who felt it `` a religious duty ' ' to oppose aaron burr ' s political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint .	76.295166
the seven founders were completely dedicated to the public service .	29.425802
madison once remarked `` my life has been so much a public one ' ' , a comment which fits the careers of the other six .	70.23286
franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests .	69.539856
washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management .	428.86676
he served as commander in chief during the revolution without compensation .	354.41098
john adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , jeremiah gridley , to `` pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it ' ' .	24.211931
in taking account of seventeen years of law practice , adams concluded that `` no lawyer in america ever did so much business as i did ' ' and `` for so little profit ' ' .	89.19403
when the revolution broke out , he , along with jefferson and jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice .	116.54039
hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter washington ' s cabinet .	138.70015
while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .	71.07317
`` if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars ' ' , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was secretary of the treasury .	39.696575
to support his large family hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service .	79.084076
talleyrand passed his new york law office one night on the way to a party .	36.989994
hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle .	45.255222
`` i have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in order to support his family ' ' , he reflected .	72.75291
all seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .	39.18938
john adams asserted in the continental congress ' declaration of rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the british constitution and the common law , and jefferson appealed in the declaration of independence `` to the tribunal of the world ' ' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature ' s god ' ' .	39.734554
they fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of 1783 .	29.872728
this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between john jay and a tory refugee , peter van schaack .	62.248264
jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend van schaack .	44.37833
yet when , at war ' s end , the ex-tory made the first move to resume correspondence , jay wrote him from paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement	111.48942
`` as an independent american i considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that john jay never ceased to be the friend of peter van schaack ' ' .	60.413177
the latter in turn assured him that `` were i arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , i should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause ' ' .	56.654182
all seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation .	56.619263
`` we have now a national character to establish ' ' , washington wrote in 1783 .	73.251175
`` think continentally ' ' , hamilton counseled the young nation .	83.4329
this new force , love of country , super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one ' s own state , was epitomized by washington .	66.59458
his first inaugural address speaks of `` my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love ' ' .	78.81393
all sought the fruition of that nationalism in a federal government with substantial powers .	89.47727
save jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the federal constitution .	18.390059
they supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable .	36.00546
historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the seventeen nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs . limited government , with hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and jefferson and madison upholding the latter position .	107.96344
the state ' s rights position was formulated by jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better hamiltonians than jeffersonians .	155.94968
in purchasing louisiana , jefferson had to adopt hamilton ' s broad construction of the constitution , and so did madison in advocating the rechartering of hamilton ' s bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a hamiltonian protective tariff .	56.810654
indeed , the old jeffersonians were far more atune to the hamilton-oriented whigs than they were to the jacksonian democrats .	40.571
when , in 1832 , the south carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which madison had advanced in his old virginia resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman .	121.91415
in his political testament , `` advice to my country ' ' , penned just before his death , madison expressed the wish `` that the union of the states be cherished and perpetuated .	77.38106
let the open enemy to it be regarded as a pandora with her box opened	145.88109
and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into paradise ' ' .	19.316431
nostalgic yankee readers of erskine caldwell are today informed by proud georgians that tobacco road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the dow-jones average than with the cotton crop .	170.90071
thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the south -- an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of southern writers .	52.36758
indeed , it seems that only in today ' s southern fiction does tobacco road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom .	48.079365
those writers known collectively as the `` southern school ' ' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize	104.00969
according to many critics , in fact , the south has led the north in literature since the civil war , both quantitatively and qualitatively .	31.732107
such writers as william faulkner and robert penn warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .	103.61714
it is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season ' s cotton and tobacco crops	129.85901
of the stereotyped negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields	142.24678
of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the south its progressive leaps of the past century .	68.92309
this is not to say that the south is no longer agrarian	39.244217
such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .	25.425966
but the south is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature .	66.64674
in 1950 it had become 47 . 1% urban .	437.80756
in a mere half-century the south has more than tripled its urban status .	36.092922
there is a new south emerging , a south losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades .	77.67614
as the new south snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the north -- a tendency which willard thorp terms `` yankeefication ' ' , as evidenced in such cities as charlotte , birmingham , and houston .	57.33067
it is said that , even at the present stage of southern urbanization , such a city as atlanta is not distinctly unlike columbus or trenton .	148.9384
undoubtedly even the old southern stalwart richmond has felt the new wind william styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for bankhead mcgruder , a civil war general , now renamed , in typical california fashion , `` buena vista terrace ' ' .	78.72499
the effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .	87.22709
as for progress , the `` backward south ' ' can boast of baton rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126 , 000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25 , 000 .	55.175922
the field , then , is ripe for new southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the southern yankeefication the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems	154.4533
truman capote is still reveling in southern gothicism , exaggerating the old southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday .	119.700195
william styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a southern writer and yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he publishes .	149.52533
even the great god faulkner , the south ' s one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters	122.87748
such are simply not within his bounded province .	5.4680405
where are the writers to treat these changes ? ?	8.201372
has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ? ?	43.73822
perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades .	220.82549
lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as confederate money .	69.30531
an example of the changes which have crept over the southern region may be seen in the southern negro ' s quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 .	56.63333
today the negro must discover his role in an industrialized south , which indicates that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma hasn ' t changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint .	78.89285
the negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one .	153.17073
this represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .	91.90569
but there have been abrupt changes as well the sit-ins , the picket lines , the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago .	62.045662
today ' s evidence , such as the fact that only three southern states ( south carolina , alabama and mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday ' s southerners into speechlessness .	86.97402
other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses	150.66087
his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the supreme court decision of 1954 .	127.786674
then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it	144.66725
only historical evolution will determine which ) an abrupt change .	23.106228
since 1954 the negro ' s desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion .	67.35696
he has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws .	78.82558
this bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the southern way of existence .	38.381413
a new order is thrusting itself into being .	108.50385
a new south is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man .	81.81596
the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern fiction .	82.94261
it is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters `` yassuhs ' ' and `` sho ' nufs ' ' with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in old south terms , `` massuh ' ' ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as caldwell ' s lester .	51.069576
while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through the rural south , such men appear to be a vanishing breed .	58.782906
writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man	82.37139
but they obviously mean by this , not a negro personality , but a negro type .	119.9952
presenting an individualized negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could tackle	111.17784
and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare .	140.74785
just as the negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature .	127.04345
the book concerned with the negro ' s role in an urban society is rare indeed	70.54826
recently only keith wheeler ' s novel , peaceable lane , has openly faced the problem .	133.66933
all but the most rabid of confederate flag wavers admit that the old southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .	53.133564
many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious old south ' ' imagery , creating such lasting impressions as margaret mitchell ' s `` tara ' ' plantation .	60.37168
modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .	101.14159
perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing	81.57028
but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .	50.533875
as john t . westbrook says in his article , `` twilight of southern regionalism ' ' ( southwest review , winter 1957 ) `` the miasmal mausoleum where an old south , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with ' ' .	75.451324
westbrook further bemoans the southern writers ' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting yankees `` our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence ( of urbanization ) presented to his senses .	152.21332
he is too deeply steeped in william faulkner and robert penn warren .	59.643837
the fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hogs and night riders .	55.927193
on this trip to the south he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight ' ' .	77.68825
obviously , such a northern tourist ' s purpose is somewhat akin to a child ' s experience with disneyland he wants to see a world of make-believe .	56.75845
in the meantime , while the south has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious yankee , southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region ' s progress .	133.74036
willard thorp , in his new book , american writing in the twentieth century , observes , quite validly it seems `` certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched .	81.08143
no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what herrick , dreiser , and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did for new york .	74.27363
there are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south ' ' .	43.695858
not a single southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material .	168.2513
faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard .	201.86768
faulkner culminates the southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done .	61.065384
he has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably .	284.51065
he treats it with a mythological , universal application .	171.28685
as his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes families .	102.95315
even two decades ago in go down , moses faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the south might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil .	111.49064
yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .	130.75969
faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of yoknapatawpha county , the gradual changes which seep into the south , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the old way .	101.85905
thus faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the `` new ' ' south has gradually evolved out of the old south , and consequently its agrarian roots persist .	58.701393
yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself the problems with which a new south must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization .	150.1694
with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil .	189.38393
the thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas .	141.29825
another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre .	60.990158
most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting .	81.7708
but robert rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them .	64.44278
he has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for mr . cunningham ' s summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity .	90.70554
for mr . taylor ' s images and reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl ' s cape lined with grass .	170.25002
mr . nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .	20.233917
in fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound .	91.22979
to raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , mr . nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit .	104.95859
he began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be .	59.192017
he went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them .	67.70809
the depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .	53.126408
in each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .	79.22909
the dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself .	78.79462
or , clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a `` finial ' ' .	56.235577
as the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give birth to a new being .	69.13559
from this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .	173.27278
thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition .	53.96973
but , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ? ?	55.82294
some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work .	78.62587
others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .	105.506386
an approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of charles olson ' s statement of the process of projective verse `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception ' ' .	82.3593
the creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .	150.60153
he disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre .	106.99931
the unit of form is determined subjectively `` the heart , by the way of the breath , to the line ' ' .	36.68671
the test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters .	93.49064
an earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious .	98.56624
the resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .	34.401627
the contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .	100.133224
he is still concerned , however , with a personal event .	49.350784
he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation .	49.563908
the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .	29.307203
some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth .	77.28938
rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world .	112.738434
but in this approach it is the artist ' s ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work .	45.45914
others look to more objective devices of order .	3.7107513
the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities .	79.03224
the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) .	121.279526
he may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .	64.44392
but he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .	120.822556
musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .	97.01959
again , the composer must select his own materials .	144.27025
but a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the i ching , the chinese book of changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials .	95.55559
avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned to similar approaches .	144.70222
some let dances take their form from the experience of creation .	47.980114
according to katherine litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance ' ' .	32.03193
the process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it .	56.91526
the sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap	54.825066
or it may involve more subtle distinctions the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head .	91.27052
even the least alteration will change the quality .	68.91819
an exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance .	65.243965
the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for miss litz , or spontaneous , as it is for merle marsicano .	47.79878
she , too , is concerned with `` the becoming , the process of realization ' ' , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns .	49.396812
the design is determined emotionally `` i must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me ' ' .	36.61609
looking back , miss marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson pollock .	84.96957
at one time she felt impelled to make dances that `` moved all over the stage ' ' , much as pollock ' s paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas .	105.73762
but her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself .	157.74417
midi garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .	87.948364
it may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground .	82.70309
this became a dance called prelude to flight .	5.0857058
a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .	137.66968
alwin nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .	45.37202
he seeks to make his dancers more `` godlike ' ' by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light , color , and sound .	27.72406
if his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from mars , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities .	74.98266
it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered .	133.6093
in his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the `` first revealed stroke of its existence ' ' , states the theme from which all else must follow .	102.11762
the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .	191.5552
it may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions .	167.67241
it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs .	71.744026
unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content ' ' .	30.428415
movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .	165.54332
though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , merce cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim .	179.4606
he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect .	74.480644
he bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .	167.07193
an order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered ' ' .	99.39109
thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well .	57.959377
chance , he finds , enables him to create `` a world beyond imagination ' ' .	72.75124
he cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert `` why , it ' s extremely interesting .	69.29682
but i would never have thought of it myself ' ' .	14.570716
the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life .	91.06659
at one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly	77.80013
nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella .	171.89346
they look straight at the audience , not at each other .	45.38363
he lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .	117.230774
if one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon .	92.42929
their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all .	52.487675
the sequence is determined by chance , and mr . cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices .	114.45393
he may take slips of paper from a grab bag .	28.513899
the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed .	62.968727
the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance .	71.35197
the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance .	58.693333
the `` approximate ' ' is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable .	46.42155
if a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance .	78.25543
and any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether .	131.16609
mr . cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method	670.3389
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .	44.68539
however , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute .	386.0697
he must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .	42.3472
he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .	160.43394
the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the founding fathers .	116.97827
the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of webster and calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee .	73.561966
the people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their union .	86.9995
repeated efforts -- beginning with the missouri compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as clay and douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action .	153.04962
even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century .	54.960445
nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .	142.07541
the present issue in atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the american one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by civil war .	62.108467
and so i would only touch upon it now ( much as i have long wanted to write a book about it ) .	80.79286
i think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject .	132.9138
the difference came down to this the southern states insisted that the united states was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a union of states .	99.0434
to their leaders the constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it .	38.43386
this right of the state , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the union government .	37.23476
the champions of the union maintained that the constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of america , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could .	67.458885
writing to speed on august 24 , 1855 , lincoln made the latter point clear .	182.99046
in homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede .	55.150406
we began by declaring that all men are created equal .	93.72127
we now practically read it , all men are created equal except negroes .	114.96584
when the know-nothings get control , it will read , all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics .	156.8167
when it comes to this , i shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy ' ' ( his emphasis )	83.27681
when the southern states exercised their `` right to secede ' ' , they formed what they officially styled `` the confederate states of america ' ' .	27.952665
dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the articles of confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy .	53.78601
the fact is that the southern confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the federal constitution did .	88.47131
the confederate constitution copied much of the federal constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance .	39.05877
it operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the federal constitution .	260.50424
it made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .	67.82642
the difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861	694.6555
many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the constitution of the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede .	41.227413
but though each of its members had asserted this right against the union , the final constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .	108.57849
its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution .	80.06553
their president , jefferson davis , interpreted their constitution to mean that it `` admits of no coerced association ' ' , but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the constitution ' ' .	57.586735
the constitution of the southern `` confederation ' ' differed from that of the federal union only in two important respects it openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the federal constitution .	107.34759
they recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .	57.945675
' ' the other important difference between the two constitutions was that the president of the confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .	106.50728
these are not , however , differences in federal structure .	207.59338
the only important differences from that standpoint , between the two constitutions , lies in their preambles .	45.323982
the one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .	118.43575
here are the two preambles federal constitution , 1789	1971.0549
`` we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america ' ' .	45.026737
`` we the people of the confederate states , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of almighty god -- do ordain and establish this constitution for the confederate states of america ' ' .	65.113335
one is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought .	29.927675
but though the southern states , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states .	88.4544
if the union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union .	141.47981
lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the union a vital one whether it was a union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to `` anarchy or despotism ' ' .	75.032486
much as he abhorred slavery , lincoln was always willing to concede to each `` slave state ' ' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it .	81.816475
though his election was interpreted by many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union , lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the constitution gave the states .	86.84609
after the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action even in the border states that stayed with the union .	85.47289
he issued his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the union .	125.26697
in his message of december 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which i would call the lincoln law of liberty-and-union `` in giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free ' ' .	76.17011
what lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the union .	60.288055
he fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people ' ' .	22.857775
the truth on each side won in the civil war	101.06574
the fact that the americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater .	105.31127
out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the south as in the north , as america ' s true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom ' ' , as lincoln promised .	49.364964
but before this came about , 214 , 938 americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .	64.756546
on their decisive battlefield lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here ' ' .	54.48472
he understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his second inaugural .	72.05266
to my knowledge , lincoln remains the only head of state and commander-in-chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .	150.48158
so great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .	107.9569
it is much less difficult now than in lincoln ' s day to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the states and to their union .	60.149994
they differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth that individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves .	92.11382
the 140 , 414 americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion ' ' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the united states from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .	76.941086
but the fact that 70 , 524 other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served liberty-and-union in other essential ways .	125.65697
its appeal from ballots to bullets at fort sumter ended by costing the southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man .	121.64836
the very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure .	209.2942
there was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .	246.69
there was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet .	87.023605
yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for .	45.685894
the lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all americans against freedom ' s other foe .	122.90133
as cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural ' ' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world .	49.48483
the useful suggestion of professor david hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments .	183.97263
will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ?	68.73044
the answer is , of course , yes .	6.122558
for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .	133.97678
social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of archimedes .	68.46036
but it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .	62.23892
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons	134.60342
we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down	345.14484
at what stage are social sciences then ? ?	1.0538232
is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of newton ? ?	64.864456
there is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in copernicus and in freud .	65.43598
and it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .	95.22041
political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man .	65.646996
consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .	79.66531
most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .	75.65694
the most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .	75.34681
just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .	121.135216
we are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .	51.214745
in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .	293.11566
i want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .	91.40836
there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .	91.527695
lucretius has remarked `` the reason why all mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of god ' ' .	86.867004
it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .	9.592511
we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was .	87.803
we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .	96.32161
the bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .	37.17296
we are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may `` push the button ' ' .	56.347454
i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly .	93.48805
they are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .	56.257275
they include both individual fears and collective ones .	3.274984
they arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .	48.77345
often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .	84.965515
yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .	119.887276
to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .	178.57112
but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .	103.92229
the frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .	250.1554
it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .	63.69625
this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions .	80.7326
this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .	71.985825
in fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .	53.56507
there is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .	27.902473
solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .	46.487362
our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing .	79.67087
this almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .	138.8037
we , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .	80.666794
and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave .	128.64671
what elements of our behavior are decisive ? ?	1.0144053
our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?	80.40957
we have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .	110.4723
i think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city .	44.761417
if an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .	34.55836
with the group of boys it is different .	3.3670294
he does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .	49.561813
when confronted with a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .	66.0102
i believe that what i do has some effect on his actions and i have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics .	108.00763
i am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose .	346.60394
our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .	73.74153
we are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .	131.91054
our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them .	183.71797
we use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust ' ' , `` cheat ' ' , and `` get tough ' ' .	24.296026
we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles .	98.58349
we perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .	98.220505
small wonder , then , that we fear .	31.99939
the achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .	101.26802
what additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? ?	89.53921
in the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics .	29.428806
in the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio- and physiological chemistry .	31.332396
the major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .	108.75295
in addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .	95.21491
even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated .	89.17323
apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .	68.85818
how and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .	79.738014
in some areas , the progress is slower than in others .	49.962997
in agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .	68.87532
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .	222.8058
there are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .	234.801
much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .	76.67866
the persistent horror of having a malformed child has , i believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .	77.10103
in fact , the recent warnings about the use of x-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .	107.6396
in fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty .	153.65231
perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .	117.8923
the situation with regard to our attitude and `` control ' ' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people .	115.08382
the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear i have tried to describe .	49.735966
nothing like godot , he arrived before the hour .	79.68313
his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday , and i came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .	72.4324
my wish to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .	92.75093
american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .	5.1798277
even so astute a commentator as harold clurman of the nation has said that `` waiting for godot ' ' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair ' ' .	32.667168
but to me beckett ' s writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .	91.43962
could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? ?	101.73847
is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? ?	67.3959
or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? ?	57.01748
i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .	68.20312
my curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation i had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near paris .	73.32533
when beckett ' s name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that beckett `` hates life ' ' .	88.437195
that , i thought , is at least one thing i can find out when we meet .	42.397415
the features of his face are distinct , but not fine .	42.61631
they look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .	22.123129
unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .	148.65396
for he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .	70.11571
his light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking .	117.92536
he seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .	103.69009
the mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .	3.4681542
the voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage .	115.48583
the irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the french .	59.24968
his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .	120.90802
he wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .	156.20839
we walked down the rue de l ' arcade , thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .	74.91136
the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering .	41.242794
for one thing , the world that beckett sees is already shattered .	134.43523
his talk turns to what he calls `` the mess ' ' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion ' ' .	30.556688
i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .	110.58098
what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .	100.193115
we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion .	38.545597
it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .	126.492775
the only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess .	43.452812
it is not a mess you can make sense of ' ' .	21.42586
i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but beckett did not take to the word truth .	55.216503
`` what is more true than anything else ? ?	6.53392
to swim is true , and to sink is true .	144.5243
one is not more true than the other .	11.489038
one cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess .	43.31542
when heidegger and sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , i don ' t know , but their language is too philosophical for me .	65.54181
one can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess ' ' .	39.77881
then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .	144.00674
until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things .	41.619816
it realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .	426.0011
`` how could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be ' ' ? ?	67.99228
but now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment .	60.36607
it is there and it must be allowed in ' ' .	32.8044
i granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .	154.10098
how , i asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ?	161.54489
would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ?	36.44133
if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .	106.00002
beckett ' s own work is an example .	38.993156
plays more highly formalized than `` waiting for godot ' ' , `` endgame ' ' , and `` krapp ' s last tape ' ' would be hard to find .	15.236663
`` what i am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art .	60.672737
it only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else .	61.241684
the latter is not reduced to the former .	34.20022
that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates .	106.77068
to find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now ' ' .	28.150219
yet , i responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? ?	47.238155
is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ? ?	65.45792
what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? ?	81.35259
`` not this ' ' , he said , and gestured toward the madeleine .	34.806576
the classical lines of the church which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory , dominated all the scene where we sat .	105.47072
the boulevard de la madeleine , the boulevard malesherbes , and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the age of reason .	29.420723
this does not allow the mystery to invade us .	29.417112
there is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer ' ' .	49.359386
i asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .	43.743008
didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide	2818.21
hamm ' s world is death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside .	163.36818
is this life-death question a part of the chaos ? ?	58.341114
if life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability .	53.138596
if there were only darkness , all would be clear .	16.430475
it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable .	152.79128
take augustine ' s doctrine of grace given and grace withheld have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ? ?	166.25868
two thieves are crucified with christ , one saved and the other damned .	69.46495
how can we make sense of this division ? ?	4.250607
in classical drama , such problems do not arise .	74.32156
the destiny of racine ' s phedre is sealed from the beginning she will proceed into the dark .	72.20698
as she goes , she herself will be illuminated .	107.02738
at the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark .	64.57056
within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there is not such clarity .	86.809616
the question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation .	333.12253
but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable .	220.32462
the key word in my plays is ' perhaps ' ' ' .	32.389927
given a theological lead , i asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays .	53.301514
`` well , really there is none at all .	10.950765
he knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .	15.5119505
the family was protestant , but for me it was only irksome and i let it go .	76.56708
my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died .	252.17065
at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .	124.20527
irish catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper .	36.748333
when you pass a church on an irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross .	37.94614
one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs ' ' .	134.67622
but do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ? ?	164.21072
`` yes , for they deal with distress .	8.935408
some people object to this in my writing .	4.0143743
at a party an english intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why i write always about distress .	234.52594
as if it were perverse to do so ! !	42.27361
he wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood .	80.55221
i told him no , that i had had a very happy childhood .	78.19582
then he thought me more perverse than ever .	17.069983
i left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi .	95.686035
on the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees .	162.93997
one does not have to look for distress .	4.136879
it is screaming at you even in the taxis of london ' ' .	36.763
lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming at us .	37.9693
the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar to qualities i had found in the plays .	103.26732
he says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .	141.82233
`` perhaps ' ' stands in place of commitment .	252.4824
at the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .	297.23975
if there were only the mess , all would be clear	88.84643
as a christian , i know i do not stand where beckett stands , but i do see much of what he sees .	76.84898
as a writer on the theater , i have paid close attention to the plays .	71.10782
harold clurman is right to say that `` waiting for godot ' ' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of europe ' s present politics , ethic , and common way of life ' ' .	42.508217
yet it is not only europe the play refers to .	83.349
`` waiting for godot ' ' sells even better in america than in france .	131.1377
the consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to europe than to america , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature ' ' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture .	75.76473
america is now joining europe in this `` mature ' ' phase of development .	44.099014
whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of asia and africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .	57.916473
even hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never maintained that sex was all .	211.82674
hemingway ' s fiction is supported by a `` moral ' ' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .	73.28646
and d . h . lawrence , in fantasia of the unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .	58.13132
though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex .	81.694954
`` all is not sex ' ' , declared lawrence .	366.0272
man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .	120.452614
the creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self .	54.11632
but for the beat generation all is sex .	4.179151
nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex .	79.15232
for the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct .	48.725597
he has elevated sex -- not eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead	72.01892
it is astarte , ishtar , venus , yahwe , dionysus , christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe .	27.225729
jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse .	41.222546
lawrence lipton , in the holy barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure	53.004143
it is a mystique , and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse .	90.72331
the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place .	89.65947
the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire .	84.95227
for this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy .	30.398903
the beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates .	272.7611
it is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy .	95.13036
they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .	31.215658
unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of `` necking ' ' and `` petting ' ' .	20.661724
if they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo	32.670395
as lipton , the prophet of the beat generation , declares `` in the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power .	61.759163
this is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat ' ' .	96.39067
this is the holy grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond .	70.12664
if wilhelm reich is the moses who has led them out of the egypt of sexual slavery , dylan thomas is the poet who offers them the dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz .	72.78619
in addition , they have been converted to zen buddhism , with its glorification of all that is `` natural ' ' and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing .	41.662895
thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious ' ' metaphors they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .	104.37032
what they are after is the beatific vision .	13.046551
and zen buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release .	78.99807
the style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience .	60.48567
jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect .	199.55847
jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm	37.8589
indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value .	99.72697
that is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it .	132.50224
instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction .	94.697556
thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being .	252.52718
jazz , like sex , is a mystique .	38.03291
it is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man .	99.9765
the mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living .	59.18409
those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination .	115.82495
righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats	358.12778
let them learn to `` swing ' ' freely , to let go , to become authentically themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved .	151.51472
the beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present .	77.50595
if he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil .	90.50295
he will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth .	115.17275
that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians	31.830544
they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in .	51.14534
apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .	49.603863
their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation .	42.54681
the mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life	116.31598
they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious .	19.629658
with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .	29.33316
their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .	13.435717
their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent .	168.77803
and the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing , painting , music .	83.82145
when they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation .	66.81354
it is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed .	66.5298
what they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the muse .	85.84323
monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability .	99.266945
one girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion .	112.62453
if it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ?	147.56136
`` most often ' ' , she says , `` it ' s the monogamous relationship that is dishonest ' ' .	15.281109
this girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life .	19.238007
she finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous .	14.911056
this confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences .	114.8095
in the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme .	66.73744
hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex	187.33325
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .	137.53287
one beat poet composes a poem , `` lines on a tijuana john ' ' , which contains a few happy hints for survival .	54.13968
the new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity .	115.332184
the professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .	64.068275
who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ?	9.6940775
nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .	47.80254
they embrace independent poverty , usually with a `` shack-up ' ' partner who will help support them .	66.57299
they are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .	13.733705
their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void .	65.16461
they feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police .	57.58514
this is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these `` religious ' ' heights .	127.08682
one beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up .	79.8232
what obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ? ?	186.07849
sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth .	34.58164
everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism .	234.44087
in his chapter on `` the loveways of the beat generation ' ' , lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details .	31.67433
no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in west venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group .	56.634274
the women who come to west venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move .	124.570755
others who are attracted to this mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums .	22.387444
those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .	54.748474
since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated .	18.263506
part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .	23.780903
as lipton puts it `` the eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms .	86.7081
the magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm ' ' .	67.791214
under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being .	126.046974
carried high on this `` charge ' ' , he composes `` magical ' ' poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words .	66.761566
if he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work -- allen ginsberg ' s `` howl ' ' is a striking example of this tendency -- that is disoriented , dionysian but without depth and without apollonian control .	57.16007
for drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity .	38.86319
how is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses .	41.20919
if love reflects the nature of man , as ortega y gasset believes , if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre .	57.079037
there were fences in the old days when we were children .	148.75516
across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles .	75.96941
alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one ' s head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .	55.351635
side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses	50.862408
front fences were covered with virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle .	9.991385
square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage	104.46413
they were topped by steeples complete in every detail high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable .	29.294392
on these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang .	27.13022
the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree .	81.12362
the primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us .	98.1287
from high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible .	76.72328
one looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .	63.814236
every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees .	89.30124
in the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub , snowball , rose-of-sharon and balm-of-gilead .	21.80281
from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea a neighbor ' s gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .	71.932945
time is a queer thing and memory a queerer	282.4257
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .	141.18814
from maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .	318.79807
in a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water	18.95625
the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it .	23.99658
and yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one ' s being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .	127.08828
the part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` it could have been like that for only a little while ' '	111.6372
but true memory does not count nor add it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time .	176.68094
once , then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences , when i was too small to reach the apple tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up .	170.27527
that world was in scale with my own smallness .	92.733864
i have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that i could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of november	71.01278
ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes	115.20791
hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it .	117.207184
i think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .	62.743576
my great-grandmother , i have been told , made her garden her great pride	419.19223
she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar	47.79504
she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house .	43.880142
these my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .	123.66643
three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink	81.06956
the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them	46.794697
i have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .	122.81591
other flowers we might gather as we pleased myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs	22.57348
the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach	152.34445
hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink-petticoated ladies	281.13916
and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere .	156.75786
more potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .	113.81099
flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead .	95.231125
pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite	34.087822
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch	186.3462
red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them	89.18293
morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag	221.52144
bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made `` gloves ' ' on the ends of ten waggling fingers .	29.538689
fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to `` spit tobacco , spit ' ' .	59.02716
dead fledgling birds , their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags .	52.686214
and the cast shell of a locust , straw-colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back .	89.376595
every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade .	59.324142
we collected `` lucky stones ' ' -- all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway .	39.936405
when these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated .	223.12198
we showed them to each other and said `` would you have guessed ' ' ? ?	23.857307
squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by .	120.381874
thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness	41.14757
even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the sleeping beauty ' s enchanted castle , or when rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside .	67.15283
we enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school .	104.37147
in the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone	187.27083
our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch .	37.898735
they never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` don ' t go outside the gate ' ' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation .	110.40727
we were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .	34.608658
we were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .	59.921375
the street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an august afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .	94.35415
every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it .	116.73638
a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves .	61.102783
a wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again .	101.607956
if a child watched its progress he whispered , `` hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away ' ' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses ' feet returned no more .	83.56899
when the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster ' s cart might turn the corner .	140.1899
the horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees .	50.5256
sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice `` rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today ' ' ! !	55.720577
the lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .	14.628472
no one seemed to hear him , no one heeded .	52.31483
the horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .	80.54107
it became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .	20.27284
after his passage , the street was empty again .	93.66775
the sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down	149.30197
the trees ' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn .	57.852966
at four-o ' clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day	56.381588
he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing .	91.97571
the streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer	365.1141
they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday .	180.7969
but the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides .	94.30234
the curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees .	67.27591
opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .	43.160717
the street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center	5.874171
it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones .	85.24459
it had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .	68.978096
the hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses .	88.63325
cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys ' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .	41.92125
it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for mann ' s work .	66.26606
the wife , amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous ' ' and `` indolent ' ' , possibly `` a mischief maker ' ' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning ' ' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` birdlike brain ' ' .	26.362104
lautner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves ' ' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs ' ' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order ' ' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled `` they will be destroyed ' ' .	44.6376
the trick these two play upon jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .	230.1874
his appearance as lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience	241.47487
it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .	126.88797
at the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like jacoby ' s , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life .	87.817955
the music which lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal ' ' .	63.51603
but it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice ' ' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art ' ' .	45.58061
and this occurs now , at the refrain of jacoby ' s song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` lizzy ' ' --	23.52399
a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius ' ' .	7.1110115
`` a miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude ' ' .	89.9559
it is this modulation which reveals to jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife ' s infidelity .	45.207233
by the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience	254.98468
in the work of every artist , i suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about	102.49452
not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment .	108.63898
the horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby	62.795776
the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering ' ' )	52.12012
the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself	119.618774
beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of mann ' s work .	39.317688
when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , i come up with the following ideas , which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .	89.48069
love is the crucial dilemma of experience for mann ' s heroes .	23.99798
the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .	94.31052
the release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible	577.1234
this prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art	123.01342
it is particularly the artist ( tonio kroger , aschenbach , leverkuhn ) who suffers from it .	44.965782
the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough ' ' in the realm of art .	15.018678
again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .	89.117386
finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of mann ' s stories .	58.34153
we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .	141.33344
for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody .	60.010506
professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .	103.44445
that this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art	142.05875
that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in mann ' s stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between jacoby and lautner .	91.15386
it appears that the dominant tendency of mann ' s early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .	99.07108
in a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same .	61.0038
something of this can be learned from `` the way to the churchyard ' ' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .	73.18725
there is no more `` plot ' ' than that	218.46352
only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give .	261.61478
the artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness .	107.2444
the first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent `` the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end	74.98323
that is to say , to the churchyard ' ' .	4.0061903
and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction .	40.70014
the highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .	38.89988
but that is too simple , and won ' t hold up .	10.98021
as the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end .	60.551727
but the highroad , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death .	84.4746
thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang ' ' , while on the footpath one man walks alone .	62.374542
this man ' s isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent .	30.492077
he is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth	65.50166
also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account .	200.42627
his name is praisegod piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author ' s repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` death in venice ' ' , for example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp .	65.97043
this strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .	77.677246
the cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` life ' ' -- that and a license number , which piepsam uses in addressing him .	144.68457
`` life ' ' points out that `` everybody uses this path ' ' , and starts to ride on .	88.41932
piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` life ' ' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather .	115.23138
that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecates doom on life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well `` all you light-headed breed ' ' .	55.98731
this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .	69.22614
then an ambulance comes along , and they drive praisegod piepsam away .	275.1963
this is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .	85.390884
the season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect .	165.42125
piepsam ' s fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because god will not stop him	57.539253
as piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments `` his justice is not of this world ' ' .	64.9473
life is further characterized , in antithesis to piepsam , as animal the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle a dog in a wagon is `` admirable ' ' , `` a pleasure to contemplate ' '	123.96115
another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid of interest ' ' .	30.641197
piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur ' ' and `` puppy ' ' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face .	59.728333
the ambulance is drawn by two `` charming ' ' little horses .	63.875885
piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense .	34.63699
his religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness	108.87842
his unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings	100.66996
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe praisegod piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated ' ' .	81.235176
the cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic life , `` blithe and carefree ' ' .	18.452938
`` he made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth ' ' .	37.97674
he is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard ' ' .	8.608063
but he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than life considered as a cyclist .	78.664085
and if i have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in mann ' s writing the crude sketch of piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , naphta and leverkuhn .	82.230896
in method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism ' ' , anticipates a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as leverkuhn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic ' ' .	43.118866
it resembles , too , pictures such as durer and bruegel did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for example , or a deadly sin .	78.700745
`` gladius dei ' ' ( 1902 ) resembles `` the way to the churchyard ' ' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` life ' ' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .	42.445892
the monk savonarola , brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background of munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of m . bluthenzweig	99.839485
in particular against a madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter ' s mistress .	50.322544
hieronymus , like piepsam , makes his protest quite in vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating	103.326035
he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter .	38.690998
on the street outside , hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in florence , and prophetically he issues his curse `` gladius dei super terram cito et velociter ' ' .	54.95709
the `` reality ' ' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world .	93.6235
their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason .	19.802935
these polar concerns ( imitation vs . formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time .	31.481764
the breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes .	75.88669
thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers .	56.867188
the image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery .	139.40344
all such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality ' ' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved .	88.154144
the person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .	82.263725
whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .	68.584816
without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being .	68.364815
and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .	123.41618
for better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation ' ' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism .	37.65621
a broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist ' s creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises .	84.72176
on the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .	46.798
we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .	23.718718
accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which i shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which i shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) .	66.43581
the word `` mimesis ' ' ( `` imitation ' ' ) is usually associated with plato and aristotle .	17.793123
for plato , `` imitation ' ' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence .	146.09439
all artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations ' ' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic ' ' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect .	34.625404
in plato ' s judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers .	76.496864
presupposed in plato ' s system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .	85.332596
aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .	77.43742
the poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation ' ' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did plato .	90.97431
but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .	83.27677
for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality .	66.83897
the central concern of erich auerbach ' s impressive volume called mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .	87.613045
following the theme of incarnation in the gospels , the christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures ' ' of divine power and reality .	86.1222
here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .	119.64296
artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama .	58.783325
the artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .	85.10378
he is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .	45.348736
i have chosen to use the word `` mimesis ' ' in its christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .	79.31486
in the first instance , `` mimesis ' ' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations .	53.998653
by `` image ' ' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith .	81.09914
this is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .	92.770615
mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .	97.248634
the images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately	102.019554
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .	36.76002
they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality .	124.23921
as in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images .	108.80285
mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .	41.76172
a word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene ' ' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings .	58.316864
similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field .	104.65239
a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .	41.09087
the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials .	43.62677
when words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .	157.19319
these are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .	99.968346
the presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood .	124.65442
underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .	89.430695
experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect .	82.448494
neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs .	197.93149
primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc . ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities .	63.350002
in contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .	130.25151
the most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself	147.55539
a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part .	350.60965
these desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one ' s good , others threatening ill .	99.00827
gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .	22.815453
in its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one ' s life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .	114.63292
the principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy ' ' is alfred north whitehead .	50.754913
our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .	91.93988
we feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening .	260.53482
later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience .	67.031334
it takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one ' s world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .	129.98099
whitehead is here questioning david hume ' s understanding of the nature of experience	28.804882
he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from hume ' s presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived .	67.225784
what hume calls `` sensation ' ' is what whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy ' ' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .	49.036915
as long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .	84.00022
whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world .	130.59473
in this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct .	96.60008
a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .	20.34684
both i and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which i now am .	164.11359
after only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree ' ' , to be sure .	40.660404
there were more indications by the mid-twentieth century .	6.0680833
i leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but i noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from memphis to hattiesburg .	53.313602
in town after town my companion pointed out the negro school and the white school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .	80.003975
it really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by booker t . washington had been going on .	93.20013
but with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .	69.67052
for over a hundred years southerners have felt that the north was picking on them .	20.890478
it ' s infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .	169.74736
by what right of superior virtue , southerners ask , do the people of the north do this ? ?	73.432014
the traditional strategy of the south has been to expose the vices of the north , to demonstrate that the north possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that ' ' as james ' s christopher newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad i may be , you ' re not quite the people to say it ' ' .	71.114235
in the pre-civil war years , the south argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the north .	100.37038
at the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there ' s no more of the true spirit of `` integration ' ' in the north than in the south .	27.372335
people talk about `` the law of the land ' ' .	7.7085843
but people can ' t be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by southern standards ) by law .	134.67326
i was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to n . v . peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the european middle ages , one in american history , and one in the far east ) , and i asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy ' ' ( francis thompson ' s words for the hound of heaven ' s pursuit ) by judicial fiat .	62.054
they didn ' t seem to be able to think of any .	64.34403
a virginia judge a while back cited a roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .	40.748447
but i suspect that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which tacitus was talking about when he said , `` they make a desert , and call it peace ' ' ( `` solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant ' ' .	62.15807
moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable	77.60258
mr . justice taney ' s dred scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the north , and soon became a dead letter .	55.795845
prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated northeast ! !	150.98514
the cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .	57.318424
the declaration of independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed ' ' .	50.30231
the phrase `` consent of the governed ' ' needs a hard look .	114.49836
how do we define it ' ' ? ?	1.0082954
is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ?	10.0468855
calhoun dealt with this question in his `` disquisition on government ' ' .	44.91084
to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority ' ' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation ' ' .	63.21048
who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ?	53.834484
that regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ?	1.2229345
that the court order does not unequally affect the southern region ? ?	37.065792
who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action is incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed ' ' ? ?	31.258556
a friend of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .	79.08955
he seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .	77.58948
i murmured something about a possible difference between new mexico ' s history and mississippi ' s .	39.38405
one can meet with aloofness almost anywhere the thidiu viewpoint , it doesn ' t affect us ! !	31.509384
southern liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they ' re rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .	57.864967
the trouble here is that it ' s almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn ' t cost you anything .	69.25494
you ' ve already sent your daughter to miss x ' s select academy for girls and your son to mr . y ' s select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .	55.395706
if there ' s no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there ' s always new england .	35.204525
new england academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , south as well as west .	76.85052
they may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from thailand , or any place other than the american south .	112.37412
it would be interesting to know how much `` integration ' ' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of new england .	65.8359
a recent newspaper report said there were five negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at yale	95.9433
that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish ' ' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national ' ' .	25.809593
i must confess that i prefer the liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .	85.8775
i leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are .	83.90183
i ' m talking about the grand manner of the liberal -- north and south -- who is not affected personally .	133.82092
if these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ?	70.597435
) , what voices would be left ? ?	1.008544
well , after everybody has followed the new england pattern of segregating one ' s children into private schools , only the poor folks are left .	103.74924
and it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .	85.563416
a dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the south and has spent many years in new england , said to me not long ago `` i can ' t forgive new england for rejecting all complicity ' ' .	68.9362
being a teacher of american literature , i remembered whittier ' s `` massachusetts to virginia ' ' , where he said `` but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown ' ' .	70.54315
there is a legend ( hawthorne records it in his `` english notebooks ' ' .	22.939344
and one finds it again in thomas nelson page ) to the effect that the mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of negro slaves .	111.851295
whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .	138.83784
it is something which most of us try to get out from under .	63.192184
like the cowboy in stephen crane ' s `` blue hotel ' ' , we run around crying , `` well , i didn ' t do anything , did i ' ' ? ?	30.657053
robert penn warren puts it this way in `` brother to dragons ' ' `` the recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence ' ' , where innocence , i think , means about the same thing as redemption .	64.28144
a man must be able to say , `` father , i have sinned ' ' , or there is no hope for him .	26.298927
lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` second inaugural ' ' that god `` gives to both north and south this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came ' ' .	114.5166
he also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman ' s two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil ' ' .	22.228548
lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of new englanders engaged in the slave trade .	56.881184
after how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ? ?	281.20163
it is a question which new englanders long ago put out of their minds .	27.280005
but didn ' t they get off too easy ? ?	37.01822
the slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave-owners they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth	43.420296
they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care .	137.12614
emerson -- platonist , idealist , doctrinaire -- sounded a high transcendental note in his `` boston hymn ' ' , delivered in 1863 in the boston music hall amidst thundering applause `` pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim .	54.087776
the slave is owner , and ever was .	91.3269
it is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist .	65.0508
it ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) .	97.22471
like pilate , they had washed their hands .	9.869202
can god be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ?	67.37064
new englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration of independence , as jefferson explained in his `` autobiography ' ' ``	34.404667
the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of africa was struck out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .	64.11091
our northern brethren also i believe felt a little tender under those censures	197.53812
for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others ' ' .	56.768543
george w . cable ( naturalized new englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` paradise road , northampton ' ' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` southern question ' ' .	39.376255
it was nice to be able to isolate it .	11.229591
new england , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the nation .	52.932674
there one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the united states .	36.65396
it is true that new england , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start .	119.66539
but i think that something more than this is involved .	32.952385
how did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of american democracy , failed to flourish in new england as it did in other parts of the country ? ?	73.37206
isn ' t it a bit odd that the three states of southern new england ( massachusetts , connecticut , and rhode island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been a & m colleges ? ?	150.08865
was it supposed , perchance , that a & m ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the new england world in the post-civil war period , the immigrants having been brought in from southern europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the west ? ?	91.04405
is it not ironical that roger williams ' s state , rhode island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? ?	86.38369
the state universities of maine , new hampshire , and vermont are older and more `` respectable ' '	48.85544
a yale historian , writing a few years ago in the yale review , said `` we in new england have long since segregated our children ' ' .	46.815887
he was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .	207.34627
and what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! !	180.26448
i don ' t propose to go into their history , but i have one or two surmises .	57.557228
one is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children .	113.01526
in the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory .	79.84744
among the recipients of the nobel prize for literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of english .	223.20084
of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than verner von heidenstam , the swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .	77.2378
equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of sweden in the past and continues it into the present .	44.661522
in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .	77.566025
heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .	54.07416
on his father ' s side he was of german descent , on his mother ' s he came of the old swedish nobility .	68.61037
the family estate was situated near vadstena on lake vattern in south central sweden .	35.39477
it is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .	86.36948
as a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of sweden ' s ancient glory .	73.993416
he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .	66.35678
being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in italy , then in greece , egypt , asia minor , and palestine .	62.893764
in one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .	83.38537
deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of gerome in paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .	74.698524
he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` the happy artists ' ' .	37.28744
`` i scanned the world through printed symbol swart , and through the beggar ' s rags i strove to see the inner man .	47.750416
i looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart ' ' .	34.730984
in this final line , we have the key to his nature .	84.351555
few writers have better understood their deepest selves .	2.89894
it may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in paris .	88.5057
the first result of heidenstam ' s long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , pilgrimage and wander-years ( vallfart och vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .	34.7264
it was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did byron ' s childe harold .	59.580505
professor fredrik book , sweden ' s foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows `` in this we have the verse of a painter	89.137024
strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .	22.068367
in a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic	147.82799
all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively .	81.526146
the young poet-painter reproduces the french life of the streets	134.44305
he tells stories of the thousand and one nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of damascus .	59.03366
in the care-free indolence of the east he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it .	65.17281
and yet amid all the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years is a cycle of short poems , `` thoughts in loneliness ' ' , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing ' ' .	26.727873
of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` nameless and immortal ' ' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the swedish language .	90.24939
it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of neptune at paestum , next to the parthenon the noblest example of grecian classic style now in existence .	94.765144
on the eve of his return to their native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .	143.91722
the supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .	83.23858
not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .	60.6363
`` the man ' s true reputation is his work ' ' .	28.89255
the short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` thoughts in loneliness ' ' is , as professor book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .	68.52483
it consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as `` the spark ' ' `` there is a spark dwells deep within my soul .	56.405655
to get it out into the daylight ' s glow is my life ' s aim both first and last , the whole .	137.39378
it slips away , it burns and tortures me .	28.740784
that little spark is all the wealth i know , that little spark is my life ' s misery ' ' .	24.361246
a dominant motive is the poet ' s longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations `` not men-folk , but the fields where i would stray , the stones where as a child i used to play ' ' .	107.994026
he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .	84.060005
what he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause ' ' to which he can honestly devote himself .	45.007698
this restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in sweden .	59.915
his cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .	49.45651
he did not , however , find himself at once .	41.71254
his next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled hans alienus , which professor book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .	48.86125
the hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the east , a sort of faustus type , who , to quote from professor book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .	86.178314
he is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of tiveden ' ' .	21.334192
from this time on heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .	118.98499
by the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions .	61.52578
he did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .	65.318855
like his friend and contemporary august strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .	52.79435
he saw sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .	54.442608
strindberg ' s remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .	99.44238
heidenstam ' s conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .	49.301743
whether in prose or poetry , all of heidenstam ' s later work was concerned with sweden .	82.2447
with the first of a group of historical novels , the charles men ( karolinerna ) , published in 1897-8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career .	59.355267
in scope and power it can only be compared to tolstoy ' s war and peace .	47.083473
about one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .	61.323246
though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself .	69.94183
hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king	50.649635
on the fatal battlefield of poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people ' ' .	62.833515
the charles men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .	63.229706
somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .	82.06489
they comprise a great variety of scene and interest grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters .	51.34351
almost nothing is said of charles ' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat .	70.45813
to carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .	103.67812
his peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .	236.08397
george meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .	80.88981
of few authors is this more true than of heidenstam .	132.02783
the charles men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .	198.88277
the career of charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of napoleon .	94.85013
his ideal was alexander of macedon , as napoleon ' s was julius caesar .	14.1219
his purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .	34.147007
each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .	52.41576
each failed catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .	213.65962
each is still glorified as a national hero .	3.2720687
the first half of the charles men , ending on the climax of the battle of poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .	31.282928
after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .	66.363235
like napoleon , he was the worst of losers .	33.312157
there are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the swedes in adversity .	60.03263
then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .	82.99638
this comes out in `` when the bells ring ' ' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the danes .	57.809174
in `` the king ' s ride ' ' , charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .	59.621597
he finds it in utter misery and desolation .	10.359972
all his people ask for is no more war .	83.21215
but he plunges into yet another , this time with norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .	58.081306
then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .	208.4844
from being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of sweden .	48.708233
this is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , `` a hero ' s funeral ' ' , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem .	30.7414
slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .	70.319176
the guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .	67.30659
as he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .	54.8183
heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in swedish memory .	415.74823
excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of the charles men , and need not detain us here .	136.4333
it is different with his volume the swedes and their chieftains ( svenskarna och deras hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .	39.345837
admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to swedish history for readers of other countries .	139.22746
some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .	54.85038
especially touching is the chapter , `` the little sister ' ' , about a king ' s daughter who became a nun in the convent of st . birgitta .	32.786232
gustaf vasa is a superb example , and charles 10 , , the conqueror of denmark , hardly less so .	137.4957
of gustavus adolphus and charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak .	84.25191
today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .	70.53461
it is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited .	47.41204
the mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways .	129.0857
on the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .	81.5536
as a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client .	66.91384
for this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine .	130.37224
on the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases	268.2747
no client would ever think of asking him to do such things .	18.587421
whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder .	155.43533
operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .	111.46348
he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .	71.087105
thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman .	35.542835
he is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society .	55.482758
it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective .	108.4435
by virtue of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost .	91.63845
at the same time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man .	63.36843
in this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds .	42.683952
he is a public servant but not a cop .	112.25293
in short , the fictional private eye is a specialized version of adam smith ' s ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare .	74.510376
in the mystery story , as in the wealth of nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin .	103.38646
there is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement adam smith was wrong .	373.25888
not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism .	95.36027
the rise of the giant corporations in western europe and the united states dates from the period 1880-1900 .	18.124708
now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as balzac , dickens , and poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction .	58.55209
sherlock holmes , the ancestor of all private eyes , was born during the 1890s .	95.61465
thus the transformation of adam smith ' s ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life .	70.85587
driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private detective .	46.376602
the birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal .	43.47877
even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved .	69.95204
the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct he enforces the law without being told to do so .	88.56025
but his morality rests upon that of his society .	46.494453
the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal .	55.169132
unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good .	120.7098
as capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma .	38.989872
if he is good , he may not be legal	124.86692
if he is legal , he may not be good .	25.650972
it is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story .	56.639244
with the advent of sir arthur conan doyle ' s sherlock holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins .	25.580574
he is very close to being a mental case .	26.25791
a brief list of the great detective ' s little idiosyncrasies would provide dr . freud with ample food for thought .	101.482025
holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants	27.23402
he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln	51.295143
he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist .	31.381811
holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds .	362.80002
his eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .	2.3005238
it was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes became a detective in the first place .	79.07578
as he informs watson , `` my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence .	58.460808
these little problems help me to do so ' ' .	3.1635253
holmes is a public servant , to be sure	6.4995236
but the society which he serves bores him to tears .	45.76984
the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior .	55.159718
although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland yard , holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police .	208.28061
they for their part are convinced that holmes is too `` unorthodox ' ' and `` theoretical ' ' to make a good detective .	38.333546
why do the police find holmes `` unorthodox ' ' ? ?	3.6238093
on the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine .	288.0297
another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by watson when he observes on several occasions that holmes would have made a magnificent criminal .	148.5598
watson ' s insight is verified by the mysterious link between holmes and his arch-opponent , dr . moriarty .	31.349289
the two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness .	66.3341
the first series of sherlock holmes adventures ends with holmes and moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff .	53.838512
they are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace .	90.88625
linked to holmes even in death , moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .	48.838703
just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the detective , so holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both .	134.73094
in the modern english `` whodunnit ' ' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared .	84.286545
hercule poirot and lord peter whimsey ( the respective creations of agatha christie and dorothy sayers ) have retained holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits .	42.295326
it is true that they are also extremely dull .	9.117688
their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a sherlock holmes .	67.102165
the latter ' s real descendents were unable to take root in england	60.94905
they fled from the victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy atlantic .	85.84135
in the american `` hardboiled ' ' detective story of the ' 20s and ' 30s , the spirit of the mad genius from baker street lives on .	96.75363
like holmes , the american private eye rejects the social conventions of his time .	43.450035
but unlike holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt .	124.12167
surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled ' ' private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation .	36.826717
his alienation is far more acute than holmes '	4.6819005
he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast .	21.4086
with rex stout ' s nero wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane .	214.75723
wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .	60.205463
more profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of raymond chandler ' s philip marlowe .	58.435303
in a society where everything is for sale , marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought .	61.28942
his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence .	97.30166
beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals , always alone , always despised .	100.9285
in the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care	86.5161
a similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of eric ambler and dominates the most famous of all american mystery stories , dashiell hammett ' s the maltese falcon .	36.800766
sam spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon	59.663433
but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake .	65.87327
now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer .	66.09764
for sam spade , neither crime nor virtue pays	881.67633
moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .	11.633395
because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police .	72.94966
the latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .	116.02969
in either case , they do not appreciate the private detective ' s zeal .	37.5506
perry mason and hamilton burger , nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal .	128.93172
frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer	382.95023
dashiell hammett ' s red harvest provides a classic example of this theme .	68.14711
but even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye .	48.572495
he is , like phillip marlowe , too alienated to be reliable .	44.543133
finally , in the maltese falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion sam spade becomes the chief murder suspect .	169.23141
in order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend .	73.234375
what was only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes now appears as a direct accusation the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .	68.16004
it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma .	71.81499
by upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption .	64.40383
that society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal .	35.45263
if the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .	53.243042
he must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .	116.62193
on the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism .	74.91622
dashiell hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits .	150.31985
in order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man .	63.00648
the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by mickey spillane ' s mike hammer .	37.870293
at first glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors .	60.891273
he kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge , jury and executioner rolled into one .	233.55048
it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in table 1 .	57.086605
great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network .	53.746185
by monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers .	74.863304
as a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation .	104.479515
for example , suppose a man wearing a $200 watch , driving a 1959 rolls royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` what time is it ' ' ? ?	67.79031
this sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car .	58.02995
if the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation .	61.06518
also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command .	179.41295
however , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to table 1 .	47.207664
on this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .	31.114813
presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host ' s desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors .	72.03799
the party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another .	124.320526
the information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears .	77.396736
since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net .	89.41991
as shown in figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .	47.84404
this , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up .	184.39323
all four types of message listed in table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged .	111.5828
the completeness of the connections provide that , for n people , there are af lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1 , 225 ) for a party of fifty guests .	60.490143
looking at the diagram , we see that af connection lines come in to each member .	212.82196
thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness .	114.79789
in spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the af incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if n exceeds about six .	187.56673
the crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes .	78.424095
for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers , then the `` open house ' ' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door .	114.31894
we consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence .	48.21115
we assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in figure 2 .	47.63524
information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- , third- , and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor .	18.446392
in figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number .	100.66895
the numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors .	10.982658
it will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers .	140.37619
in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens .	202.83295
a point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n .	139.58057
the dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort .	100.18929
since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp .	81.33394
location theorists have given these matters much consideration .	6.470231
the networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war .	55.49723
they also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored .	166.12674
without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party .	17.686228
the need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling .	134.53218
alexander the great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once .	153.0951
as time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased .	63.647667
next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value .	156.05107
on the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in figure 3 .	60.478577
the monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence .	66.65837
no questions , statements , or explanations are permitted -- only commands .	216.9418
commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank .	127.43715
the same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal .	120.85788
all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks .	51.62337
even the officer in charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring .	230.18434
this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility .	453.54868
are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound	961.1007
and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground .	50.12711
this monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .	106.55691
with troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication .	49.513966
years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard .	124.86145
in contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal .	62.86396
in the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior .	65.25632
a military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .	123.42301
this objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .	7.652884
the connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village .	62.55084
the assumptions upon which the example shown in figure 3 is based are ( a ) one man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc . .	95.57204
( b ) a message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times .	64.2493
( c ) decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .	111.31879
and ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank .	64.225685
these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel .	97.390915
the number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55 , 987 men .	167.02844
this organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .	49.611217
of types of message listed in table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3 .	94.53551
a further regulation is that commands always go down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go up , unaccompanied by commands .	72.979546
questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor .	110.85731
it will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice .	225.7791
furthermore , the network in figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced .	179.00917
not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks .	155.20908
such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach .	88.811905
this is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the finns in geochemistry .	62.83561
we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes .	77.93938
this problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis .	45.917557
since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it .	124.65894
first , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .	19.7044
but , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such .	127.78711
for example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only x-rays , applying only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites	105.70071
or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven andean indians .	66.158775
so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more .	69.54665
american democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the american democratic faith .	28.444466
those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 .	76.89604
and he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law .	49.9443
i want to say more about gabriel ' s so-called fundamental law .	35.398247
but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it .	60.88506
he points out that from the time of jackson on through world war 1 , , evangelical protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of america .	40.425404
he terms this early enthusiasm `` romantic christianity ' ' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical protestantism ' ' .	52.328705
let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme .	78.17163
he says `` beside the protestant philosophy of progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the united states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy ' ' .	51.711742
he specifies , `` in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism , in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism .	26.932083
but in every period it has been humanism ' ' .	4.2674575
and let me add , utopianism , also .	1688.2954
some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay i called the leader follows -- where ? ?	152.83717
i used his polarity to illustrate what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call progressivism .	92.32331
it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .	57.1414
that is to say gabriel ' s fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more .	96.11479
it is a weakness of gabriel ' s analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy .	76.44057
and with progressivism the religion of humanity was replacing what gabriel called christian supernaturalism .	357.1101
and the common man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on his own .	45.82183
during the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the voice of god and fled from behind saint woodrow ( wilson ) only to learn from science , to his shocked relief that after all there was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much couldn ' t be expected of him .	89.61446
the socialism implicit in the slogan of the roosevelt revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution , or of the jacksonian frontier .	90.653435
what had happened to the common man ? ?	1.0946015
french egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of popularism .	59.808163
the riotous onrush of industrialism after the war for southern independence and the general secular drift to the religion of humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the french revolution ' s socialistic offspring of one sort of another .	58.37693
the first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson .	225.01869
moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s , the dislocations of the depression , the common ethos of materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced mike fink and the great gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the little people .	56.498142
however , it is important to trace the philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former .	60.939693
that john locke ' s philosophy of the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration of independence , i believe , we generally accept .	55.52092
yet , after rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the french revolution also .	104.55493
the importance of rousseau ' s twist has not always been clear to us , however .	49.261574
this notion of the general will gave rise to the commune of paris in the revolution and later brought napoleon to dictatorship .	73.83774
and it is clearly argued by lord percy of newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , the heresy of democracy , and in a more general way by voegelin , in his new science of politics , that this same rousseauan idea , descending through european democracy , is the source of marx ' s theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat .	63.22115
this is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after world war 2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace .	143.2311
the long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under a socialist state .	69.39265
and the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar .	36.742218
and by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually marxist .	54.567238
we will recall that the still confident liberals of the truman administration gathered with other western utopians in san francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world the united nations .	99.94828
we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation .	48.21616
then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .	140.40793
during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal .	73.21654
during the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon the atom bomb .	102.60435
in 1952 , it will be remembered , the g . o . p . without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly .	56.626446
all of this , i know , is recent history familiar to you .	414.0411
but i have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under eisenhower ' s leadership .	76.96413
a perceptive journalist , sam lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .	65.28694
he opens his discourse , however , with a review of the eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age .	116.93572
the show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .	134.73859
lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue .	111.92524
and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation `` in essence the drama of his ( eisenhower ' s ) presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism ' ' .	115.758575
i will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism .	60.654514
it has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused .	51.1777
obviously there has been no agreement on what american conservatism is , or rather , what it should be .	47.471752
for it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began .	169.76096
i saw a piece the other day assailing william buckley , author of man and god at yale and publisher of the national review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal .	84.03985
but i ' m not here to define conservatism .	262.14536
what i am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course .	136.34297
one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , i suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with eisenhower conservatism .	66.32679
though , to be sure , we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment .	169.31874
this is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise .	37.564995
but before i try to diagnose it , i would offer other evidence .	211.65874
i will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year .	89.3509
the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by life magazine , under the title of the national purpose .	36.502686
the contributors to this testament were all well-known a former democratic candidate for president , a new deal poet , the magazine ' s chief editorial writer , two newspaper columnists , head of a national broadcasting company , a popular protestant evangelist , etc . .	66.83954
what i want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception .	74.21256
i suppose we might classify billy graham as an old liberal .	30.68155
and i would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song .	176.79808
its refrain was `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation ' ' .	32.41214
adlai stevenson expressed some reservations about this return .	6.3684955
only walter lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes ' ' .	60.4934
but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent .	54.63974
the second specific comment was the report of eisenhower ' s commission on national goals , titled goals for americans .	142.34415
they , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that eisenhower requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly of columbia university , because it was non-partisan .	65.86642
the commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism .	83.66528
and here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above `` the paramount goal of the united states set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity ' ' .	83.9052
this group is secularist and their program tends to be technological .	16.78984
but it is the need to undertake these testaments that i would submit here as symptom of the common man ' s malaise .	54.461197
and let me add murray ' s new book as another symptom of it , particularly so in view of the attention time magazine gave it when it came out recently .	151.19768
father murray goes back to the declaration of independence , too , though i may add , with considerably more historical perception .	103.606415
i will reserve discussion of it for a moment , however , to return to president kennedy .	33.893887
as symptomatic of the common man ' s malaise , he is most significant a liberal and a catholic , elected by the skin of his teeth .	63.48233
does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? ?	74.00248
what is the common man ' s complaint ? ?	16.221684
let ' s take a panoramic look back over the course we have come .	53.313427
has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under eisenhower ? ?	191.26213
and the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic .	94.37913
ralph gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress .	115.25181
but there ' s a subjective side to that utopian outlook .	81.27943
does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ?	85.89224
here there may be an analogy with cancer we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .	71.123184
should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ?	18.98792
and almost the only `` cure ' ' is early detection and removal .	229.04457
one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society ' s organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before .	113.216125
so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .	314.42953
in any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease ' ' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical .	63.368763
have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? ?	61.132244
hence the prime issue , as i see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .	91.19043
we are already committed to establishing man ' s supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today .	79.3441
otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate .	118.10894
we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .	54.942677
we must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies otherwise why try anything ? ?	340.10165
so in these pages the term `` technology ' ' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man ' s control over himself and over other men .	98.26875
naturally this includes all communication forms , e . g . languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .	36.290016
properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution .	160.86415
if we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man	96.00073
but we cannot start off with a clean slate .	63.6038
so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man ' s major needs .	52.532032
asked which institution most needs correction , i would say the corporation as it exists in america today .	78.28286
at first glance this appears strange of all people , was not america founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring `` undeveloped ' ' societies abroad ? ?	98.107086
but hear harrison e . salisbury , former moscow correspondent of the new york times , and author of `` to moscow -- and beyond ' ' .	59.31337
in a book review of `` the soviet cultural offensive ' ' , he says , `` long before the state department organized its bureaucracy into an east-west contacts staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of american culture had carved its mark across the russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' porgy and bess ' overrode the state department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines .	69.68581
they were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like henry ford , hugh cooper , thomas campbell , the international harvester co . , and david w . griffith .	32.684517
their kind created an american culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies .	107.014885
this favorable image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-american propaganda ' '	66.87369
perhaps the public ' s present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur ' ' no more exists in america .	50.70508
in his stead is a milquetoast version known as `` the corporation ' ' .	17.206247
but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america , foreigners can	101.025375
and our loss of `` prestige ' ' abroad is the direct result .	127.61885
no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts .	40.596996
if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .	18.924923
first , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership .	252.01184
businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .	302.29254
when we `` forced ' ' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what i would term `` pseudo-capitalism ' ' and so took a major step toward socialism .	71.23091
the biggest loss , of course , was the individual ' s lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .	47.76442
socialism , i grant , has a definite place in our society .	35.22643
but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic .	62.464043
some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society .	337.48474
but the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .	51.54004
its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .	42.044056
it serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .	169.25917
as a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing ' ' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .	171.14789
as to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services .	139.79712
the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy .	81.09368
but while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .	91.31192
so we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation ' s needs for survival .	81.163895
the corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .	25.415524
ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .	74.6218
examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e . g . constructing major airports or dams .	69.52626
thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi-governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs .	74.924225
in all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship ' ' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .	49.05042
avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society	141.23662
and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .	95.65871
such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .	451.34055
corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e . g . , quarterly and annual dividend reports .	17.808626
proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control	231.2422
proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community .	73.32376
corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public .	76.98593
the proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders .	65.33228
leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .	58.50096
men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now .	217.12706
hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest .	63.79075
proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e . g . the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .	57.602722
corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) .	110.53648
the right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .	53.804276
to perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic .	83.63341
when the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it .	114.307
strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole .	84.92153
strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .	113.008675
certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .	90.99128
if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? ?	53.797825
these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology .	84.515175
individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition .	38.42996
we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders .	165.22157
persons developed in today ' s corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside .	240.45764
in my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , i have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal ' ' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .	63.11377
also , i am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .	91.41229
any abilities i may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family .	120.32632
this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , i assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .	189.31575
perhaps a list of some of the `` practices ' ' of my company will help here .	37.7499
the company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles .	218.52666
from an initial investment of $1 , 200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10 , 000 , 000 ( we don ' t disclose financial figures to the public ) .	71.055016
its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth	773.5125
our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition .	146.54608
during the last years of woodrow wilson ' s administration , a red scare developed in our country .	71.38987
many americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force .	102.97043
postmaster general burleson set about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails .	85.68447
attorney general palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4 , 000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights .	55.332
then , not many years later , the un-american activities committee , under the leadership of martin dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens .	97.83276
anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government .	95.579834
this hysteria reached its height under the leadership of senator joseph mccarthy .	8.225386
demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions .	117.000916
new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how .	34.22833
those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency .	96.615746
they give strict interpretation to william james ' statement that `` every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself ' ' .	48.788605
they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .	263.03876
hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .	71.80019
despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools	301.69495
they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page	161.00774
they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply .	153.40324
so all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others .	113.33625
seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away ' ' .	70.92148
that , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval .	121.23309
criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds .	253.74667
merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration .	84.30323
of course , there must be clarity a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones .	109.30705
the writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st . joseph , missouri .	46.858566
an inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts .	85.95026
he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done .	48.24193
despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of einsteinian calibre .	19.69709
true , ideas are important , perhaps life ' s most precious treasures .	26.497055
but have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ? ?	113.93169
have we not actually developed idea worship ? ?	1.069503
ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere .	224.73431
here we find stored the wisdom of great minds .	110.54993
but are all these works worthy of consideration ? ?	42.43016
shakespeare ' s wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries .	66.10066
but was he infallible in all things ? ?	1.1919379
what of his treatment of the jew in the merchant of venice ? ?	31.270655
shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of shylock , but probably he never saw a jew , unless in some of his travels .	76.56872
the jews had been banished from england in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years .	42.865314
if any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place .	77.53108
shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life .	57.339123
rather than from a first-hand study of jewish people , his delineation of shylock stems from a collection of italian stories , il pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier .	60.736652
he could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit .	106.75321
harris j . griston , in shaking the dust from shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes `` there is not a word spoken by shylock which one would expect from a real jew ' ' .	62.249718
he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone .	70.58528
no jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .	385.2433
it would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman .	33.404667
just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars , or even of tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result .	74.499825
shakespeare does not tell us that shylock was an aberrant individual .	267.73718
he sets him forth as being typical of the group .	11.205358
he tells of his `` jewish heart ' ' -- not a shylockian heart	63.393486
this would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge .	15.0094595
if living jews were unavailable for study , the bible was at hand .	57.196877
reading the old testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to shylock were abhorrent to the jews .	76.02323
are we better off for having shakespeare ' s idea of shylock ? ?	18.405611
studying the merchant of venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about jews .	118.45575
does this help the non-jew to understand this group ? ?	37.85324
thomas de torquemada , inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition , put many persons to death .	75.388824
would we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today ' s roman catholics by saying he had a catholic heart ? ?	87.53196
let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong	70.36077
he is out of place in our times .	2.9002113
shakespeare ' s shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern world .	52.33363
ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good .	75.03813
a successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together .	90.835
will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ? ?	136.7383
frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .	94.4163
but is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ? ?	97.00054
what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? ?	73.86192
is there some magic in it that assures results ? ?	162.95459
when peter b . kyne ( pride of palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the japanese , did the heated debates of the californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? ?	42.492542
the leopard ' s spots came from the pen of thomas dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable ' ' law .	50.865612
if a child had a single drop of negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3 , 000 years .	135.09248
that doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? ?	127.56786
in the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked .	75.27219
the son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .	46.017082
in time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child .	73.279434
is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? ?	73.84009
will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? ?	10.6812105
for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists .	30.000237
long ago they consigned the notions of kyne and dixon to the scrap heap .	30.47204
false ideas surfeit another sector of our life .	3.894144
for several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship .	24.987028
the stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress .	31.448614
children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one .	99.00926
debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one .	71.91916
research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers .	72.53249
helen deutsch informed us ( the psychology of women , vol . 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications ' ' , a conclusion accepted by many .	76.81656
will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ?	81.99676
that is questionable , to say the least .	48.739677
research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .	26.198496
but ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough .	100.14669
in the 1930 ' s , cures for the depression literally flooded washington .	139.68684
for a time the president received hundreds of them every day , most of them worthless .	58.106018
ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate .	214.36693
when some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign .	121.667145
we have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory .	41.02991
the merits of the salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children .	68.38773
our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument .	6.7167225
but is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? ?	53.8896
man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad .	98.53254
but what a super-herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy .	192.07188
we are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government .	147.44025
assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without restraint .	87.22351
may we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? ?	98.176765
we must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results .	164.08229
in truth , we can say that this broke the power of senator joseph mccarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the american people .	39.96775
if he had been `` liquidated ' ' in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas .	56.1925
debate in the political arena can be productive of good .	72.340935
but it is a clumsy and wasteful process it can produce negative results but not much that is positive .	85.44526
debate rid us of mccarthy but did not give us much that is positive .	90.26639
it did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure	323.97052
it did not even provide the architect ' s plan for anything new .	54.768105
in the field of the natural sciences , scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results .	96.64541
in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage .	87.80678
by no means would we discourage the production of ideas they provide raw materials with which to work	115.32388
they provide stimulations that lead to further production .	11.60402
the president ' s personality would have opened that office to him .	169.6933
and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance .	48.24093
it is testimony to the deep respect in which mr . eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached .	87.31268
these began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the president ' s condition for the nation .	47.533657
and if howard rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the atlantic monthly accomplished a good deal more .	57.034145
it forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed .	101.47399
the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the president ' s decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem .	87.511925
because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the president , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .	143.75363
for the president had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way .	83.51525
but the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters .	60.048347
any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and president in a situation which should never have arisen .	92.39541
it was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at prediction .	82.53806
in no other situation would a group of doctors , struggling competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world , be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning , and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces .	120.764725
and though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error .	130.47206
it recurred in the press conferences the president ' s remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter .	130.95137
the press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions .	67.49302
he commented -- thoughtfully , a reporter told us -- that it was `` not too important for the individual how he ends up ' ' .	72.888535
he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running as in the battle of the bulge , he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers .	94.28512
yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences .	89.62998
in this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears .	82.690674
the presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent .	110.71557
it is of the utmost importance to the people of america and of the world how their governing president `` ends up ' ' during the four years of his term .	79.87723
only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death .	78.577034
ironically enough , in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury .	234.49486
at the national and international level , then , what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political immorality .	90.07604
and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us .	88.73368
for the tone of the editorials which greeted mr . eisenhower ' s original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting .	48.73556
neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people ' s intuitive sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation betraying its sense that something significant has transpired was in evidence .	97.36157
nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine , the issue which also carried the second announcement of the candidacy .	94.90107
the double editorial on two aspects of `` the u . s . spirit ' ' was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well as small , reflecting popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the highest office in the land .	85.44038
`` the moral creed ' ' and `` the will to risk ' ' live happily together , if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn .	62.40792
`` i may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age ' ' , the president had said on february 29th of the election year , ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term .	68.28129
`` my doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great ' ' .	19.278833
but by the time the risk was doubled , events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza .	239.0648
only infrequently did the situation color his thinking .	10.388901
ironically no president we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the possibility to which his own words , in the press conference held at the beginning of august , testified that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country , unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation .	91.296585
so it is that we relive his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present .	58.381603
no consideration of risk urges itself upon him now for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly focussed .	97.28356
yet with a mind less shallow , if less sharp , than some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him , he feels what he cannot formulate	95.67212
and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters .	186.90817
moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him , he adopts a position that is morally indefensible .	136.06734
he ascribes to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him .	89.689316
what is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later confirmed , has become by september of the election year `` a firm conviction ' ' .	100.89356
as a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place , the statement is an effective one we sympathize with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions .	92.507385
but it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history .	87.63268
in assigning to god the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors , eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration in the years to follow .	108.54169
in any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock .	142.26562
about this man we had to think twice .	10.481344
we knew that it was , as reassurance , the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature .	63.54941
but the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions , and thus for imposing his will on the people .	90.60322
and in the context of drifting personal utterances we have examined , there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions .	46.83607
when the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners , mr . eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more .	68.31124
the portrait that had developed , fragmentarily but consistently , was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits , when it does not forestall , any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence .	102.9746
this does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked .	191.9848
instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done .	121.198425
drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president , eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking .	93.94055
despite three warnings , no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from wilson ' s .	66.832085
by contrast , the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man .	74.76997
only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked .	159.65636
in the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail , and to articulate the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant , with what is sometimes astounding rapidity .	94.653275
like lincoln , he can distinguish his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him .	86.52612
like roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him .	117.87274
he chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed .	172.6344
the very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader .	311.53546
the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact , and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the leader ' s means for transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership .	87.277466
the making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business .	87.87429
lincoln ' s slow progress towards the several marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such , and loosely interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision .	149.81473
but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it , we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction , in the sphere of politics , on which decisions hang .	81.771736
only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize president kennedy ' s extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics .	84.25367
in his recent evaluation of kennedy ' s potentialities for leadership , walter lippmann has cited the `` precision ' ' of his mind , his `` immense command ' ' of factual detail , and his `` instinct for the crucial point ' ' as impressive in the extreme	64.95288
and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual ' s command of language interacts with the other two .	27.57786
for this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation .	102.69628
the liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups .	213.48018
rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .	59.762264
the division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change .	70.62565
rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man ' s life in society .	51.404266
these ways are absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for man ' s redemption from chaos .	42.71559
the civilizational crisis , the third type of change raises the question `` what are we to do ' ' ? ?	27.184193
for the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community .	38.392933
there is no socially existential answer to the question .	19.660555
for the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has existential status in the community , nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians .	85.9058
in this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community .	97.32036
an interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence .	538.0941
if we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke .	94.53541
the first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society .	18.817837
the first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .	13.097115
the second involves something deeper , but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests .	58.955566
thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself , and its phenomenological life .	63.9968
the third type , however , wrenches attention from the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence .	58.674637
voegelin has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable , healthy community .	25.784891
there the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced .	73.0918
this , however , cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and incoherent it has no absolute standard , and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent .	146.9008
it has lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances .	65.515625
precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself .	112.31498
for paradigmatic history `` breaks ' ' rather than unfolds precisely when the movement is from order to disorder , and not from one order to a new order .	82.46044
the liberal-conservative split , to define it further , derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification .	151.36633
when disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order , the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return .	91.264336
indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins .	81.87001
at that point we reach the `` closed ' ' historical situation the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante .	35.615963
at that point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously `` fate ' ' , or `` destiny ' ' , or `` providence ' ' , and feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society .	39.890495
the reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change .	37.950466
of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of determinability .	41.66197
its ontological status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual men , who are its `` matter ' ' , tradition , the `` form ' ' of society exists only as a shared perception of truth .	74.11167
the ontological status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of society ' s members .	18.615517
the content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization .	50.569237
those social , civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist .	45.23442
civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused .	49.962513
civilization is what man has made of himself .	8.029881
its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself .	107.13247
it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse .	16.12949
he needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion .	46.77741
and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself .	52.714417
he must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not exist as man .	72.81135
thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence ' ' .	77.70826
this happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in maritain ' s words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities ' ' .	50.33067
an existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse ' ' , as existence without substance .	68.5499
thus human perception and human volition is the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the civilizational level .	172.77843
thus with regard to the loss of tradition , in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works itself out as a disruption of the individual soul , a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent , but no longer as a man .	71.03936
further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change .	59.33379
with regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? ?	54.355488
a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process .	68.062706
this means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .	87.955414
if the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation .	113.0856
in the case of social decay , form is displaced simply by the process of dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process .	98.19142
now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fading form .	78.52898
and when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence , any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence .	156.22551
the retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation .	104.884544
however , the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening of spiritual forces .	169.35936
it would seem , therefore , that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself .	75.0536
the emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder .	34.878933
and it would seem that history is a witness to this truth .	85.38128
as a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history .	94.54146
these differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change .	196.02452
anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition .	43.215496
to experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it .	26.515982
the process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs .	159.5422
within the individual the reaction has been called various names , all , however , pointing to the same basic experience .	78.13988
weil identifies it as being `` rootless ' ' , guardini as being `` placeless ' ' , riesman as being `` lonely ' ' .	26.697927
others call it `` alienation ' ' , and mean by that no simple economic experience ( as marx does ) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation .	184.38031
within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one of persuasion .	84.963974
we note the use of rhetoric as a weapon , the manipulation of the masses by propaganda , the `` mobilization ' ' of effort and resources .	55.79518
within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis , two basic organizations of response are observable reaction and ideological progressivism .	103.92561
these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis .	27.867437
the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing .	195.84074
its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .	118.943016
to this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers .	58.01659
the implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible .	85.20712
seemingly , order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious accretions .	83.24418
the problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there .	76.2006
such a response , of course , misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence .	118.94024
moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order , once the activation of change has reached visible proportions .	85.39631
the most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself .	58.9588
despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself .	29.42858
since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class .	104.60918
their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change .	33.067318
since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention .	206.49496
and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status .	256.31796
the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational .	53.28759
but this truth is distorted by its extreme application the assumption of the separate existence of tradition .	78.33577
the reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations .	29.5208
reactionary theories , for this reason , usually assume some form of organismic theory .	55.518776
in its defensive formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community .	67.48141
in its dynamic form , it visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force -- the race , for instance , which unfolds in history .	42.143456
in both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality .	33.481922
when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual defense , the characteristics of that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction .	102.49677
reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole .	22.07271
it is a total situation that is defended the `` good old days ' ' .	28.624754
even the questionable features of the past are defended .	125.92784
the point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference .	96.42326
the reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy .	94.739525
all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work .	46.961807
is the oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? ?	68.687164
if we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , isn ' t there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? ?	58.70095
i am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst ' s consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life .	127.79228
a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man	123.18413
now we can argue that the irresistible fate of oedipus rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .	58.913162
we can also argue that the three brothers karamazov and smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father ' s woman .	70.69772
but a novel in which one man karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic quarterly .	216.02248
it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of oedipus complex as a literary descendant of oedipus rex .	43.407978
whatever the psychological truth in the oedipus myth , an oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret .	74.10549
but a modern oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose his own childhood is only pathetic , and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies .	93.641624
i am suggesting that a case-history approach to the oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller .	31.642498
the best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him .	134.7907
incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation .	65.55919
and the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story .	56.932877
which brings to mind another lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the oedipal theme .	45.568012
`` the rocking horse winner ' ' is also a story about a boy ' s love for his mother .	21.762478
if i now risk some comparisons with sons and lovers let it be clear that i am not comparing the two works or judging their merits	184.28627
i am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects .	51.626286
`` the rocking horse winner ' ' is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader -- but we do not know why .	50.78567
it is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and vain mother .	52.689438
there are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse .	103.06701
the child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother .	67.44264
the story ends in the child ' s illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother .	67.04472
the child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside .	39.353523
i had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did .	143.59538
but on one occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient i began to understand the uncanny effects of this story .	72.52624
it was , of course , a little boy ' s fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .	74.675514
how does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader ? ?	28.69608
the rocking is actually felt in the story , a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy .	59.33031
the rocking , i realized , is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message , the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child ' s fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit .	72.496056
the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present	76.245735
and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy .	70.8098
for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden love , doomed by its nature .	96.92347
we are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy ' s love for his mother does not offend , while the incestuous love of the man , paul morel , sometimes repels .	48.786076
we accord it its place there , and in lawrence ' s treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child , in fact , the form in which oedipal love is expressed in childhood .	74.07242
and when the child dies in lawrence ' s story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make his mother rich , the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all .	88.084724
we have so completely entered the child ' s fantasy that his illness and his death are the plausible and the necessary conclusion .	101.01766
i am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood .	129.7809
it is most probable that freud and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story .	65.07211
he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told , and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged .	46.479805
he would not have cared why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy .	136.06804
in our own time we have seen that the novelist ' s debt to psychoanalysis has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from this marriage .	99.35228
ortega ' s hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled .	164.39946
he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights .	19.918161
he borrows the insights of psychology to improve his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist ' s own .	89.36807
he has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character .	100.651955
if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior , that the ego is still the executive agency of personality , and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego .	113.581764
the novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the same faces .	109.99188
i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature .	66.29093
but a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth , the joke that strikes right at the center of man ' s humanness .	100.93052
moral dread is seen as the other face of desire , and here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity .	101.65478
there is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth .	52.133575
the ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies , but the myth fails before the modern truth	66.42177
the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true .	189.16858
in both the farmer ' s tale in ralph ellison ' s invisible man and in thomas mann ' s the holy sinner , the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive	80.39008
the heroic act is the casting off of pretense .	245.7457
thomas mann wrote the holy sinner in 1951 .	4.8829665
it was conceived as a leave-taking , a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths of the west , `` bevor die nacht sinkt , eine lange nacht vielleicht und ein tiefes vergessen ' ' .	14.11183
he chose a medieval legend of incest , gregorius vom stein , and freely borrowed and parodied other myths of the west , mixing themes , language , peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves , as in his previous treatment of joseph .	76.01949
but the holy sinner is not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man ' s entertainment .	35.486305
mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell .	91.06264
and when he retold the legend of gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language	132.2884
while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner .	101.21825
grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins sibylla and wiligis .	81.12072
he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast adrift soon after birth .	131.22833
the infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him .	106.00881
an ivory tablet in the infant ' s cask recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village .	55.789356
grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins .	117.032776
his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own country at a time when sibylla ' s domain is overrun by the armies of one of her rejected suitors .	48.76226
grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him .	76.62007
sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband , and the identities of mother and son are revealed .	52.143723
grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years .	65.66374
at the end of this period two pious christians in rome receive the revelation which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock .	120.652374
grigorss comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope .	108.366005
in the last pages of the book sibylla comes to rome to seek an audience with the great pope and to give her confession .	75.1405
mother and son recognize each other and , in mann ' s version of this legend , make a remarkable confession of guilt to each other , the confession of unconscious motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the time they had first set eyes on each other .	60.785618
in recollection he has said `` natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but i would suppress them sternly ' ' .	60.034058
moreover , he organized the movement of his forms , within his rigorously shaped space , into highly complex equilibriums	97.752975
and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors .	92.02953
the worthy mondrian , seeing these pictures , said in a tone of kindly reproof `` but you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition ' ' ! !	56.00466
helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true .	16.824495
his `` monumental ' ' abstraction , made up of smooth , metallic `` non-objects ' ' acting upon each other with great tension , won helion much acclaim during the ' thirties .	140.07169
the play of novel lighting effects also entered into these compositions , whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth meditating .	216.09665
as helion ' s work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval	78.81934
but leger , arp , lipchitz and alexander calder , at the time , gave him their blessing .	38.89761
his canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be `` figures in space ' ' , or `` blue figure ' ' , or `` pink figure ' '	19.993465
and they had ( vaguely ) heads and feet .	107.97091
exhibited in shows in london in 1935 , and in new york the following year , the new , more elaborated abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional dramas of great intellectual coherence .	51.670307
at this period the thirty-year old helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement ' ' , according to herbert read , `` and in the direct line of descent from cezanne , seurat , gris and leger ' ' .	52.81879
in america , meyer schapiro observed that , unlike the mondrian school , helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art ' ' .	66.693794
it is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of cimabue ' s and poussin ' s way of filling space .	53.005142
abstract art was still the right path for him	16.47098
but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction ' ' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the raphaels and poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and mondrian .	42.829952
later helion wrote of this phase `` for years i built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name .	296.82037
i played on it my secret songs , unexplained , passionate and peaceful ' ' .	43.605797
the extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold .	68.03422
he was engaged in constant experiments that searched for new directions .	90.35643
he himself did not know , as he said in 1935 .	98.16151
but he was `` afraid of the future -- he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration , a functional art of some kind ' ' .	104.82044
during the 1920 ' s the abstractionists , the german bauhaus group of industrial designers , and the new architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia , or welfare state , in which their neat and logical constructions might find their proper place .	139.97855
but whereas the postwar american abstractionists seem to helion to be determined to `` escape ' ' from the real world , or simply to rebel against it , the ordered abstractions which he and his associates of the 1930 ' s were painting embodied the hope of `` improving ' ' things .	88.657005
`` we were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come , very pure and elevated ' ' , he has said , `` in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918 ' ' .	53.27613
instead of this the 1930 ' s witnessed a tragic economic depression , the rise of fascist dictators in europe , the wasting civil war in spain .	47.56153
very much the political man , helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of france and all europe , whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky .	112.26374
in 1936 he decided to migrate to america .	7.1248045
the rooseveltian america was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for civilization .	160.56665
helion also hoped that america ' s mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works .	60.65139
`` i arrived in the united states with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions ' ' .	153.69408
in new york he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including alexander calder , george k . l . morris , de kooning , holty and a few others .	53.520477
after a year in a studio on sheridan square , having married an american girl who was a native of virginia , helion moved to a village in the blue ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases .	47.126305
the darkening world scene , at the time of the munich pact , continued to trouble his mind even in his remote virginia studio .	99.92884
`` fear possessed me , and the certainty of war ' ' , he has related .	23.466164
`` i truly smelled blood , death , heaps of corpses everywhere ' ' .	23.989492
in haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings a three-panel frieze , with a flying figure and a fallen figure	162.72404
a `` double-figure ' ' , which went to the chicago art institute , and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts	67.855995
and in early 1939 , a `` fallen figure ' ' of very ominous character , which concluded his abstract phase .	108.37117
`` i knew i was carrying on with abstraction to its very end -- for me ' ' , he said of the two years ' output in virginia .	67.92423
with those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he felt he could stop .	79.72669
they were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art .	49.27997
he had taken out first papers for american citizenship	22.938421
but after war came to europe , he decided to return to france , arriving there in january , 1940 .	75.97807
`` i hated the war ' ' , he said , `` but thought i ought to go because i was , perhaps , one of those who hadn ' t done enough to prevent it ' ' .	28.406809
in june , 1940 , sergeant helion , with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle , was sketching the hills south of the loire river , when the war suddenly rolled in upon him .	82.943405
its first apparition was a long , gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons , or pushing prams .	38.424637
his company then carried out a confused retreating movement until it was surrounded by the germans , a few days before france capitulated .	62.895687
after a sort of death march during four days without food , helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in east germany .	76.0645
a year later they were removed to a stalag in the harbor of stettin .	38.780407
at the time of his capture helion had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at woolworth ' s in new york .	75.53207
when he was stripped , deloused and numbered by his guards , his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners ' goods to be confiscated .	48.536556
`` it was then i knew that they were making war against man , the individual within ! !	181.67728
-- who questioned things when given orders ' ' .	2.5602043
at stettin the university-educated artist , who had studied german , was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the stalag commander .	36.59706
in secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners ' central committee , which plotted sabotage , planned a few escapes , and maintained a hidden control over the wretched french slave-laborers .	67.970215
in the stalag , helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other .	107.57089
how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape .	102.64555
in the prison camp ' s black market civilian clothes were quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him	171.43115
during long weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed .	14.139907
every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories .	118.18246
one evening , while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard among the prisoners remaining there , a simulated melee was staged -- just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from work .	133.5851
four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me .	93.297676
finot held a wallet with my money and papers	5916.6567
moineau and david held nothing but their fingers .	24.746473
at this moment the volley-ball hit the ground .	6.2332106
the guards all rushed up to intervene ' '	1.2189412
shedding his prison cloak , helion shot through the gates , now clad in civilian garments and with the passport of a flemish worker .	70.62491
riding trains , hitching hikes on trucks across germany , slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of secret guides , he eventually reached vichy france , and , by the winter of 1943 , was back in virginia .	45.809883
to escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind	140.66994
not only loathing of captivity , but a faith , a hope that is even stronger .	107.25289
i left behind me brave men , whom captivity had robbed of all hope .	303.91028
they too loved their families , longed for their villages yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare the fearful chance of escape ' ' .	179.63834
it was a time of revelations for him .	1.9185376
even the most rational of men , under great stress , may be transported by a new faith and behave like mystics .	114.00294
helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice of his fellow-men in arbeitskommando 13 , , stettin , as to his own fierce will and love of life .	64.542946
after that , he declared , `` to return to freedom was to fall to one ' s knees before the real world and adore it ' ' .	52.33253
in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life , his guards , his companions in misery .	131.24643
now all his desires centered on `` rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence ' ' .	81.43717
and , he added `` during the many months in prison camp , all abstract images vanished from my mind ' ' .	46.735016
before leaving for america , he happened to see his old friend jean arp and confided to him his new resolutions .	48.294926
arp protested `` but it is impossible ! !	1.1775173
everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters ' ' .	30.358799
helion , however , clung to the belief that `` in escaping from the stalag i had also escaped from abstraction ' ' .	61.963615
while convalescing in his virginia home he wrote a book recording his prison experiences and escape , entitled they shall not have me published originally in ( helion ' s ) english by dutton & co . of new york , in 1943 , the book was received by the press as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic accounts of world war 2 , from the french side .	75.97873
and the author , who seemed the embodiment of france ' s rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors , was much complimented for his daring military action .	117.69251
but when he showed his new figurative pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp , they paid him no compliments and drew long faces .	190.21239
between 1944 and 1947 helion had a series of one-man shows -- at the paul rosenberg gallery in new york and in paris -- of his new realistic pictures .	65.00224
they reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920 ' s .	54.510742
these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted french bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them .	117.446075
one of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette	84.287346
others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out .	77.806885
important as was mr . o ' donnell ' s essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has .	136.15892
he and also mr . cowley and mr . warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- nathaniel hawthorne , for example , and herman melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .	77.45009
faulkner ' s total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr . cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when mr . o ' donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the south .	63.664547
if he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist .	16.719286
if he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force .	145.62158
if he sees the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen , he sees also -- and he shows -- the blind and the mean , and he sees the compson family disintegrating from within .	94.47782
if the barn-burner ' s family produces a flem snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the compson family produces a jason compson 4 .	28.75205
others writing on faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional moralist ' ' either inadequate or misleading .	38.62232
among them are frederick j . hoffman , william van o ' connor , and mrs . olga vickery .	22.65472
they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , i believe , in pointing out faulkner ' s independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the southern tradition .	90.93754
faulkner ' s is not the mind of the apologist which mr . o ' donnell implies that it is .	35.58753
he is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at oxford , mississippi , thirty-five years ago .	70.9617
that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .	43.761692
it is to say rather , i believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .	94.59575
he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed southern .	176.04466
the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern , i rather think , for the south has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .	182.6976
some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly southern traits .	75.349754
there is no necessity , i suppose , to assert that mr . faulkner is southern .	70.13437
it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family .	79.01453
and , after all , he has lived comfortably at both oxford , mississippi , and charlottesville , virginia .	56.224396
the young william faulkner in new orleans in the 1920 ' s impressed the novelist hamilton basso as obviously conscious of being a southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so .	79.80135
besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the south during the past hundred years .	89.033966
it is more difficult with faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge .	58.82202
his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the south , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation .	74.94273
his denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the south or have written about the south .	69.024155
but in looking at faulkner against his background in mississippi and the south , it is important not to lose the broader perspective .	56.53703
his earliest work reflected heavy influences from english and continental writers .	39.617825
evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , henry james and james joyce among them .	38.559433
his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him .	126.30442
my intention , therefore , is not to say that faulkner ' s awareness has been confined within the borders of the south , but rather that he has looked at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook is southern .	71.64062
the ingredients of faulkner ' s novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him .	92.5065
a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , i think , by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region .	173.409
the planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton kennedy published swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature .	112.097435
the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .	51.875065
as they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed .	78.790184
their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the south , even while memories of the war were still sharp .	107.86958
the tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of thomas nelson page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel so red the rose , by stark young .	107.70697
although faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have stark young ' s inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society .	55.411427
the myth of the southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as francis pendleton gaines showed forty years ago , and i suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed .	88.72145
faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .	151.53142
without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the sartoris and the compson families faulkner ' s chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the civil war .	113.32836
it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .	83.3798
faulkner ' s low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels dealing with plantation life .	188.49184
they have an ancestry extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when william byrd described the lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina .	45.921883
the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the south and the southwest in the three decades before the civil war .	40.533825
these narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of horace , mr . addison , mr . pope , and sir walter scott .	119.374504
there is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south .	56.701153
william gilmore simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .	95.24834
simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully .	62.546185
augustus baldwin longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character ransy sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him .	88.68643
others who wrote of low characters and low life included thomas bangs thorpe , creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom owen , the bee-hunter	58.172577
johnson jones hooper , whose character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will	86.430824
and george washington harris , whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature .	54.404175
it would be profitable , i believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkner ' s works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to faulkner ' s time .	90.32787
such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent .	194.27074
such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers	109.405914
nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .	29.949959
one of the early humorists already mentioned , thomas bangs thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .	174.25912
thorpe came to louisiana from the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty .	95.03068
but thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions .	56.72176
as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble , arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano	73.40195
and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` the big bear of arkansas ' ' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .	42.52988
some years ago julian huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the british association for the advancement of science that `` man ' s supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age ' ' .	65.25874
as a humanist , dr . huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading zoologist , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution .	76.56722
this text from dr . huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic powers in human beings .	57.808598
there may be a case of this sort , but it is not one we wish to argue , here .	38.71909
even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another ' s minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man ' s mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books .	85.12619
even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners , one may question whether this will help them to live better lives .	183.05199
there would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course	7.8745747
such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists	57.218067
but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article .	55.120514
all we want from dr . huxley ' s statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible .	73.97958
it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many .	46.82072
each man , that is , is both one and many .	232.11172
he is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect , and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time .	53.400414
he is a parent with a child to nurture , here and now , and he is an educator who worries about the children half way round the world .	168.13083
he is a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the circumstances of today .	95.01743
he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself .	85.65053
he is a craig ' s wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the local university have come to call .	172.6716
he is the stern guardian of the status quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age , and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed .	75.66801
what will be the final symmetry of the good society ? ?	249.90752
here , on a desk , is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions .	71.68043
the pamphlets are about law , the corporation , forms of government , the idea of freedom , the defense of liberty , the various lethargies which overtake our major institutions , the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization .	81.53827
the thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor .	59.66944
there is another kind of ardor , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life , but no angry utopian contentions .	55.03912
actually , you could wish for some passion , now and then , but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos of current history which partisan social passions have wrought , you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized calm .	89.758415
you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity .	48.24361
there is essential pleasantness in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can contend without quarreling .	65.95955
this is the good kind of sophistication , and with all our problems and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the united states during recent years .	53.77373
a characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry is found in joseph p . lyford ' s introduction to the agreeable autocracies , a recent paperback study of the institutions of modern democratic society .	49.566753
mr . lyford gives voice to a temper that represents , we think , an achieved plateau of reflective thinking .	72.38835
after casting about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use mr . lyford ' s introduction as an illustration .	35.4528
at one time it seemed as if the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations .	102.4168
as things turned out , however , we have not profited greatly from the lesson instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed to be at the moment .	119.14373
such activity may or may not have irritated the kremlin , but it has frequently condemned america to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the free world .	33.996696
the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit , our tendency to rate the `` goodness ' ' or `` badness ' ' of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves .	54.710735
since the slogans have little application to reality and are sanctimonious to boot , the applause is faint even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government .	79.193474
shocked at the response to our proclamations , we grow more defensive , and worse , we lose our sense of humor and proportion .	77.709145
mr . nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our department of state , and an american president observes sourly that sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic ' ' .	54.398727
one thing you can say about mr . lyford is that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an american .	42.784267
those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination .	49.398956
the maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood .	96.930725
even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society .	109.06323
we would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries .	42.70816
the picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of american life .	52.298645
the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great , and it does not escape the notice of others .	69.20859
if our sincerity is granted , and it is granted , the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination .	75.86006
what is more , the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason , and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels .	53.64978
although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to `` free private enterprise ' ' , `` individual initiative ' ' , `` the democratic way ' ' , `` government of the people ' ' , `` competition of the marketplace ' ' , etc . , we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas , bureaucracy is corroding representative government , technology is weakening the citizen ' s confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground ' ' .	45.18048
the interesting thing about mr . lyford ' s approach , and the approach of the contributors to the agreeable autocracies ( oceana publications , 1961 ) to the situation of american civilization , is that it is concerned with comprehending the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on american life .	37.713924
in an ideological argument , the participants tend to thump the table .	48.93402
the new spirit , so well illustrated by mr . lyford ' s work , is wholly free of this anxiety .	74.14111
the problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves ' ' .	77.07438
we experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them .	62.953712
we feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them .	65.849556
it does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on the national purpose .	84.293015
the agreeable autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today .	93.60689
the men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world ' ' .	55.386803
these institutions which mr . lyford names `` agreeable autocracies ' ' -- where did they come from ? ?	41.60253
of one thing we can be sure they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society ' ' .	69.279045
no doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century .	57.171078
going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the center for the study of democratic institutions , in santa barbara .	70.76615
but however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to expose , right now , is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises .	114.4051
the host is the flowing life of the human race .	10.891733
this life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations .	54.435207
should rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the advent of television , atomic energy , and ibm machines ? ?	50.028927
how would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the field ? ?	20.011267
they tell us , sir , that we are free , because we have in one hand a ballot , and in the other a stock certificate .	86.77435
with these we shape our destiny and own private property , and that , sir , makes ours the best of all possible societies .	76.37546
the reality of the situation , however , is described by mr . lyford ``	32.326023
many of us may even be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts .	117.72338
thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall	369.91397
and the citizen narrows his political participation to the mere act of voting -- if he votes at all ' ' .	69.751625
copernicus did not question it , ptolemy could not .	74.67249
given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? ?	207.56638
the reasons for this are partly observational , partly philosophical , and reinforced by other aesthetic and cultural factors .	68.05232
the obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens .	9.696638
not only did constellations like draco , cepheus , and cassiopeia spin circles around the pole , but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night .	78.69177
nor did a constellation ' s stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights .	52.528538
the conclusion -- the distances of the constellations did not vary and their paths were circular .	185.22334
moreover , the sun ' s path over earth described a segment of a great circle	71.25717
this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon .	126.88234
as early as the 6th century b . c . the earth was seen to be spherical .	36.71636
earth , being at the center of the universe , would have the same shape as the latter	46.612373
so , e . g . did aristotle argue , although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity .	35.827168
the discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things .	77.6661
in light of all this , one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular .	104.02581
why , for example , should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of the heavens to be elliptical ? ?	30.66304
there were no reasons for such suppositions then .	48.064507
this , conjoined with the considerations above , made the circular motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly observed fact .	194.43356
additional philosophical considerations , advanced notably by aristotle , supported further the circularity principle .	78.064125
by distinguishing superlunary ( celestial ) and sublunary ( terrestrial ) existence , and reinforcing this with the four-element physics of empedocles , aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies , which moved in only a perfect way , viz . in a perfect circle .	74.959816
it must , apparently , be motion without termini .	13.420894
because motion which begins and ends at discrete places would ( e . g . for aristotle ) be incomplete .	63.577267
circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , lacks termini .	85.89629
only imcomplete , imperfect things move towards what they lack .	72.60769
perfect , complete entities , if they move at all , do not move towards what they lack .	112.18599
they move only in accordance with what is in their natures .	42.90146
thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect celestial existence .	78.14059
to return now to the four-element physics , a mixture of muddy , frothy water will , when standing in a jar , separate out with earth at the bottom , water on top , and the air on top of that .	97.83874
a candle alight in the air directs its flame and smoke upwards .	61.43619
this gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements .	70.25664
thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe .	6.6402
it is covered ( partly ) with water , air is atop of that .	156.0422
pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens .	21.00617
when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material substratum , it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios , celestial bodies will be of a subtle , quickened , ethereal existence , in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary .	125.28823
the stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth .	87.52365
this is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions .	104.861595
a projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its ' natural ' place of rest .	227.03662
but the natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest , nor rectilinear motion .	76.387436
being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake more of what is divine .	68.21362
let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic and copernican astronomy .	6.014983
bluntly , there never was a ptolemaic system of astronomy .	29.13204
copernicus ' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy .	10.024215
the almagest and the hypotheses outline ptolemy ' s conception of his own task as the provision of computational tables , independent calculating devices for the prediction of future planetary perturbations .	57.296047
indeed , in the halma edition of theon ' s presentation of the hypotheses there is a chart setting out ( under six distinct headings ) otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing the planetary motions .	94.89939
no attempt is made by ptolemy to weld into a single scheme ( a-la-aristotle ) , these independent predicting-machines .	63.7091
they all have this in common the earth is situated near the center of the deferent .	20.140789
but that one should superimpose all these charts , run a pin through the common point , and then scale each planetary deferent larger and smaller ( to keep the epicycles from ' bumping ' ) , this is contrary to any intention ptolemy ever expresses .	179.22192
he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity .	56.590626
ptolemy ' s problem is to forecast where , against the inverted bowl of night , some particular light will be found at future times .	102.657455
his problem concerns longitudes , latitudes , and angular velocities .	10.854794
the distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master , beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth .	69.58052
but none of this has prevented scientists , philosophers , and even historians of science , from speaking of the ptolemaic system , in contrast to the copernican .	46.778812
it is engendered by confounding the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the geocentric astronomy .	35.37485
ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion .	238.01425
this is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .	233.26445
so when textbooks , like that of baker set out drawings of the ' ptolemaic system ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically .	92.34713
it is the chief merit in copernicus ' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent .	68.80474
he cannot , e . g . compute the retrograde arc traveled by mars , without also making suppositions about the earth ' s own motion .	69.479996
he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem .	19.971354
in ptolemaic terms , however , eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter , to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations .	108.1461
in a systematic astronomy , like that of copernicus , retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system	52.904247
they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions .	219.58331
another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs . copernican astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity .	30.597242
it is often stated that copernican astronomy is ' simpler ' than ptolemaic .	108.18566
some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former .	34.144417
thus , margenau remarks `` a large number of unrelated epicycles was needed to explain the observations , but otherwise the ( ptolemaic ) system served well and with quantitative precision .	80.03797
copernicus , by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe , was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen .	22.691072
historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called ' revolution ' , unaware perhaps of its historical importance , he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction .	142.50517
as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized	106.56169
it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen ' ' .	19.864536
if in any one calculation ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once , while copernicus never required more than one third this number , then ( in the sense obvious to margenau ) ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than copernican .	133.80281
but no single planetary problem ever required of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time .	58.54946
this , of course , results from the non-systematic , ' cellular ' character of ptolemaic theory .	80.84466
calculations within the copernican framework always raised questions about planetary configurations .	22.127209
these could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time .	59.715977
this is more ambitious than ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems .	148.92157
thus , in no ordinary sense of ' simplicity ' is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the copernican .	49.011116
this was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within ptolemy ' s astronomy .	32.88523
analogously , anyone who argues that einstein ' s theory of gravitation is simpler than newton ' s , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts .	57.727116
in a sense , einstein ' s theory is simpler than newton ' s , and there is a corresponding sense in which copernicus ' theory is simpler than ptolemy ' s .	15.242215
but ' simplicity ' here refers to systematic simplicity .	13.955908
the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum .	42.692257
the axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .	113.90371
this characterizes euclid ' s formulation of geometry , but not ptolemy ' s astronomy .	29.349781
there are in the almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar , solar , or planetary behavior .	91.16647
the strongest appeal of the copernican formulation consisted in just this ideally , the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic ' rules ' of the theory .	163.49817
the lower-level hypotheses are never ' ad hoc ' , never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum .	159.6732
copernicus , to an extent unachieved by ptolemy , approximated to euclid ' s vision .	17.414019
de revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques .	142.34747
it is an organized system of these things .	9.832861
solving astronomical problems requires , for copernicus , not a random search of unrelated tables , but a regular employment of the rules defining the entire discipline .	74.345314
hence , noting the simplicity achieved in copernicus ' formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of de revolutionibus , another reason beyond its systematic superiority .	80.92777
1543 a . d . is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution .	24.340046
it is really the funeral day of scholastic science .	57.75757
granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the de revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow .	71.880356
but , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced .	58.621506
in what does the dissatisfaction of copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?	21.50621
what in the almagest draws his fire ? ?	1.0189146
the formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being copernicus ' primary concern , was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy , namely , the ' unphysical ' triplication of centric reference-points one center from which the planet ' s distances were calculated , another around which planetary velocities were computed , and still a third center ( the earth ) from which the observations originated .	81.92055
this arrangement was for copernicus literally monstrous `` with ( the ptolemaists ) it is as though an artist were to gather the hands , feet , head and other members for his images from divers models , each part excellently drawn , but not related to a single body	141.57976
and since they in no way match each other , the result would be a monster rather than a man ' ' .	29.46391
copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy .	8.033269
his objective was , essentially , to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends .	267.07785
that such deficiencies existed within ptolemy ' s theory was not discovered de novo by copernicus .	39.326923
the critical , rigorous examinations of nicholas of cusa and nicholas of oresme provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for nicholas copernicus ' own work .	112.46515
without abandoning too much , copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable .	116.276886
he did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution .	61.642483
henrietta ' s feeling of identity with sara sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that sara ' s epitaph in the jewish cemetery in venice referred to her as `` the sulamite ' ' .	30.49763
into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women `` in their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander .	93.452934
one is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette .	109.642395
the very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts	81.10715
usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .	81.01353
she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .	99.973206
women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld .	151.0645
she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .	59.70006
one who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .	110.49116
in any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual	66.35624
the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .	50.2811
and , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature .	158.5525
henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition .	62.673065
dr . isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of sara sullam that he considered submitting it to the century magazine or harper ' s but he decided that its jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in the messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead ' ' .	107.157036
under her father ' s influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the jewish field , but she did begin writing for other anglo-jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience .	150.40797
and she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of judas maccabeus performed at the hanukkah festival which came in december .	41.263588
by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that papa and mamma gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her aspiration .	76.85499
another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of johns hopkins university within walking distance of home .	99.35166
it was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district , with only a few professors , but all eminent men , and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings .	60.44891
in september ' 76 thomas huxley , darwin ' s famous disciple , came from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the university	43.299454
and although it was a school for men only , it afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures .	198.18668
in the following year her father undertook to give a course in hebrew theology to johns hopkins students , and this brought to the szold house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by mamma and entertained by henrietta and rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on sunday evenings .	97.27076
from philadelphia came cyrus adler and joseph jastrow .	8.106095
adler , judge sulzberger ' s nephew , came to study assyriology .	74.800934
a smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go far .	75.0269
joseph jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , marcus jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease .	51.270397
his father was a good friend of rabbi szold , and joe lived with the szolds for a while .	50.65049
both these youths , who greatly admired henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine	151.34619
and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with papa , whose mind -- although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it -- naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were .	133.818
besides , miss henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing	85.74832
so cyrus adler became interested in her friend racie friedenwald , and joe jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as henrietta , and signed himself joe -- fell in love with pretty sister rachel .	83.585335
henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with joe ' s older and more serious brother , morris , who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia with papa , when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at rodeph shalom temple there during its rabbi ' s absence in europe .	80.198
young morris , who , while attending the university of pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write henrietta twenty-page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of sarah bernhardt in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` sulamith ' ' on the jewish reform movement being promulgated by the hebrew union college in cincinnati .	97.63954
unlike his younger brother , joe , he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as `` my dear friend ' ' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style .	55.19958
and when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did .	88.96275
one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .	98.05666
she could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man ' ' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies ' ' of sara sullam	48.338737
and in her forthright way , henrietta , who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged ' ' and `` women as submissive and yielding ' ' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of dr . wise of hebrew union college -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .	89.90984
but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively szolds in their pleasant house on lombard street .	97.899734
`` we ' ve got father and mother and each other ' ' said beth on the first page of louisa alcott ' s little women	67.452774
and , `` i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world ' ' , burst out jo some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the march family , which had first appeared when henrietta was eight	109.22009
and the szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the marches .	65.66822
mr . march , like benjamin szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination	45.06236
and `` marmee ' ' march , like sophie szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the marches had only four to the szolds ' five .	67.38712
but the march girls had their counterparts in the szold girls .	31.24627
henrietta could easily identify herself with jo march , although jo was not the eldest sister .	47.172577
neither was henrietta hoydenish like jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like henrietta ' s , was the feminine form of a boy ' s name .	55.601883
but both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers to control , both loved languages , especially english and german , both were good teachers and wrote for publication .	197.61943
each was her mother ' s assistant and confidante	1336.03
and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture .	69.799614
bertha szold was more like meg , the eldest march girl , who `` learned that a woman ' s happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother ' ' .	75.87525
bertha , blue-eyed like mamma , was from the start her mother ' s daughter , destined for her mother ' s role in life .	21.576685
sadie , like beth march , suffered ill health -- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart -- but that never dampened her spirits .	62.544006
when her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , sadie learned to write with her left hand .	81.527115
she wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like `` oh , what fun ! !	83.90631
a comedy in three acts ' ' , in which , under `` personages ' ' , henrietta appeared as `` a schoolmarm ' ' , and bertha , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta had been , appeared as `` dummkopf ' ' .	51.77966
played chopin in the `` soiree musicale of mr . guthrie ' s pupils ' '	31.213575
and she recited `` hector ' s farewell to andromache ' ' most movingly , to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown near philadelphia , where the szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds ' in baltimore .	68.38558
adele , like amy , the youngest of the marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .	35.213043
for rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular march counterpart	96.07222
but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian .	237.67424
the szolds , like the marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times	205.64215
and , as in the march home , any young man who called on the szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them .	84.41868
this included mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as papa had first fallen in love with her mamma before he chose her	88.205734
and when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed the szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the szold girls and mamma .	67.874405
and just as `` laurie ' ' lawrence was first attracted to bright jo march , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister amy , so joe jastrow , who had also been writing henrietta before he came to johns hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty rachel .	78.33379
and like jo march , who saw her sisters meg and amy involved in `` lovering ' ' before herself , henrietta saw her sisters rachel and sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , rachel by joe jastrow , and sadie by max lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the mississippi .	67.74607
olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart .	85.4863
no wonder wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met .	303.2383
almost from that day , until his death , olgivanna was to stay at his side	71.73983
but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for wright and his montenegrin lady .	90.54712
it must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval .	96.20489
even so , many of the things that happened to wright and olgivanna seem inordinately severe .	91.40423
their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for .	269.43274
reporters began to trail miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make appalling statements about wright and his doings .	55.471355
flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air .	119.83681
the distracted miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person .	119.23768
at last her lawyer , arthur d . cloud , gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged .	266.79745
cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client `` i wanted to be a lawyer , and mrs . wright wanted me to be an avenging angel .	30.196846
the first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case .	193.2009
but every time i suggested this to her , mrs . wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and punish mr . wright .	75.68789
i am an attorney , not an instrument of vengeance ' ' .	13.693975
miriam noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor , and appointed a heavy-faced young man named harold jackson to take his place .	119.01376
and during the unhappy time , miriam often would charge that wright and olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of wisconsin .	92.58615
yet somehow , when officers were prodded into visiting taliesin to execute the warrants , they would find neither wright nor olgivanna at home .	67.26693
this showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle .	205.07852
the misery of miriam ' s bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain .	104.73281
to get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon wright and olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by miriam in person .	115.997
one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at spring green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in june .	156.12833
at this time miriam noel appeared , urging on constable henry pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the welsh settlers in the neighborhood .	37.7687
a troop of reporters brought up the rear .	12.398817
miriam was stopped at the taliesin gate , and william weston , now the estate foreman , came out to parley .	68.031136
he said that mr . wright was not in , and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that miriam was waving in the air .	114.22804
miriam now ordered pengally to break down the gate , but he said he really couldn ' t go that far .	44.275185
at this point mrs . frances cupply , one of wright ' s handsome daughters by his first wife , came from the house and tried to calm miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock .	77.22863
miriam noel wright said , `` here i am at my own home , locked out so i must stand in the road ' ' ! !	43.60743
then she rounded on weston and cried , `` you always did wright ' s dirty work ! !	82.337616
when i take over taliesin , the first thing i ' ll do is fire you ' ' .	35.28636
`` madame noel , i think you had better go ' ' , said mrs . cupply .	25.277416
`` and i think you had better leave ' ' , replied miriam .	15.97948
turning to the reporters , she asked , `` did you hear her ? ?	23.994404
' i think you had better leave ' ! !	65.715645
and this is my own home ' ' .	1.8719382
in the silence that followed , miriam walked close to mrs . cupply , who drew back a step on her side of the gate .	59.886013
then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , miriam said to the young woman , `` you are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly .	56.070374
you are even uglier than mr . wright ' ' .	3.1332614
the animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force	89.08598
and it gave miriam noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art .	237.83
as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him	96.177185
she also went to washington and appealed to senator george william norris of nebraska , the fighting liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard .	149.01648
then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , miriam gave a ghastly echo of mrs . micawber by suddenly stating , `` i will never leave mr . wright ' ' .	44.05867
under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers .	47.140995
miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in wright ' s remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole .	62.076584
first , wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town .	95.01091
`` that isn ' t a boulevard , it ' s a racetrack ' ' ! !	13.2095175
cried wright , showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the 1920 ' s .	36.893982
`` this is a horrible way to live ' ' , wright went on .	27.547499
`` you are being strangled by traffic ' ' .	1.3045508
he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty , and began to talk trenchant sense , though private anguish showed through in the vehemence of his manner .	175.5069
`` take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the loop ' ' , wright said .	27.934597
`` cut off every building at the seventh floor .	9.852298
if you cut down these horrible buildings you ' ll have no more traffic jams .	23.76332
you ' ll have some joy in the life of this city .	34.8821
after all , that ' s the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy ' ' .	47.705364
little enough joy was afforded wright in the spring of 1925 , when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin .	60.29297
the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning , as though miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the old testament .	74.32709
a storm did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames .	64.873116
later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire	1317.6545
at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes , and fused the k ' ang-si pottery to cinders .	44.421055
wright set his loss at $200 , 000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed .	68.5153
in spite of the disaster , wright completed during this period plans for the lake tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of american indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing .	93.6088
amid a shortage of profitable work , the memory of albert johnson ' s $20 , 000 stood out in lonely grandeur -- the money had quickly melted away .	102.58606
a series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time	148.42789
and the question before these meetings was , here is a man of international reputation and proved earning power	163.29132
how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? ?	37.716717
while this was under consideration , dauntless as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3 .	355.36096
as he made plans for the new taliesin , wright also got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation of all faiths , and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp .	85.31869
years were to pass before these plans came off the paper , and wright was justified in thinking , as the projects failed , that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to taliesin .	85.46335
and now there was some question as to his continued residence there .	248.97989
billy koch , who had once worked for wright as a chauffeur , gave a deposition for miriam ' s use that he had seen olgivanna living at taliesin .	72.566055
this might put wright in such a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin	331.22955
nor was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he was not `` compelled to spend money on useless lawyer ' s bills , useless hotel bills , and useless doctor ' s bills ' ' , he could more quickly provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris , as she preferred .	86.676056
miriam sniffed at this , and complained that wright had said unkind things about her to reporters .	86.08857
his reply was , `` everything that has been printed derogatory to you , purporting to have come from me , was a betrayal , and nothing yet has been printed which i have sanctioned ' ' .	48.311947
what irritated miriam was that wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made , which he considered she would accept `` when she tires of publicity ' ' .	90.3863
from her california headquarters , miriam fired back , `` i shall never divorce mr . wright , to permit him to marry olga milanoff ' ' .	24.888195
then miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending , and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty , with the understanding that wright would not contest it .	96.09614
the bank of wisconsin sent a representative to the judge ' s chambers in madison to give information on wright ' s ability to meet the terms .	57.412113
he said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end , and that the bank would accept a mortgage on taliesin to help bring this about .	80.46291
miriam said that she must be assured that `` that other woman , olga , will not be in luxury while i am scraping along ' ' .	116.70565
this exhausted wright ' s patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite .	125.21119
`` volstead laws , speed laws , divorce laws ' ' , he said , `` as they now stand , demoralize the individual , make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another , and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd .	57.37366
if mrs . wright doesn ' t accept the terms in the morning , i ' ll go either to tokyo or to holland , to do what i can .	65.2415
i realize , in taking this stand , just what it means to me and mine ' ' .	34.84198
here wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , `` it means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me ' ' .	99.55036
next day , word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce	66.6462
his mentioning of japan and holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking .	68.50709
no matter what troubles might betide him , this most american of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land .	260.90543
in a few weeks miriam made another sortie at taliesin , but was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates .	46.274605
more likely , you simply told yourself , as you handed us the book , that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation .	133.15506
for pride ' s sake , i will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul .	37.79602
besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood .	109.43608
but what you could not know , of course , was how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald was to lead into an american fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , taut semblance of it .	114.9988
i do not suppose you ever heard of f . scott fitzgerald , living or dead , and moreover i do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval .	108.47633
neither his appetites , his exacerbations , nor his despair were kin to yours .	80.51838
he might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him .	377.24515
but he was no man in the moon to me .	28.939596
although his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of , nor was it for yachts , sports cars , tall drinks , and swimming pools , nor yet for money or what money buys that i burned , i too was burning and watching myself burn .	210.34273
the flame was simply of a different kind .	7.312654
it was symbolized ( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image ) by that self-consuming , elegiac candle of edna st . vincent millay ' s , that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a beacon to us , but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral taper to last even the evening , let alone the night .	79.26568
one should not , of course , pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume to linger on .	124.83025
yet this passion for passion , now that i look back on it with passion spent , seems somewhat overblown and operatic , though as a diva miss millay perfectly controlled her notes .	146.75874
only what else was she singing but the old song of songs , that most ancient of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves ? ?	151.91043
perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ? ?	86.861084
one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend	117.01068
one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul .	41.949486
but it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum .	36.864826
one could see this chemical determinant as in itself a miracle .	171.43416
in any case , miss millay ' s sweet-throated bitterness , her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love , her constant and wonderfully tragic posture , so unlike that of fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props , drew from the me that i was when i fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea .	145.4259
but all this , i am well aware , is the bel canto of love , and although i have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that i listened , i know well enough that it was not .	46.06034
if i am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love , i will have to stop trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale .	44.425884
there is another side of love , more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie , or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug .	81.69523
whether you experienced the passion of desire i have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have i wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one ' s mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one ' s parents ' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger .	79.559364
at the same time , i am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox if one hates , they say it is because one loves	79.87692
if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid	176.6918
if one shuns , they say it is because one desires	543.9422
and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite .	69.27726
well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ?	116.22544
) , i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion .	90.04345
you probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as i , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the farm .	146.80963
we had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .	241.64648
we had stopped before a shop window to assess its autumnal display , when you suddenly turned to me , looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats , and with your nervous `` ahem ' ' ! !	56.530132
said `` there are things i must tell you about this man you are marrying which he does not know himself ' ' .	50.078346
if you had screamed right there in the street where we stood , i could not have felt more fear .	71.89503
with scarcely a mumble of excuse , i fled .	129.59717
i fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word `` things ' ' -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which i had already insisted upon finding out for myself ( despite , i may now say , the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood ) because i was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize life by the throat .	119.64382
i had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .	58.78005
what i fled from was my fear of what , unwittingly , you might betray , without meaning to , about my father and yourself .	184.03485
but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will .	242.46284
while my memory holds with relentless tenacity , as i cannot too often stress , to my wrongs , when it comes to my shames , it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them .	101.13835
just as i was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside of the leaf of love , memory , displeased at being asked to yield its unsavory secrets , dashed ahead of me , calling back over its shoulder `` skip it .	164.72574
but i will not skip it or cut it out .	25.854767
it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings of chance .	99.21641
if to be innocent is to be helpless , then i had been -- as are we all -- helpless at the start .	121.27289
but the time came when i was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless .	38.166885
helpless in that sense i can never be again .	315.2688
however , i confess my hope that i will be innocent again , not with a pristine , accidental innocence , but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone .	94.12107
for innocence , of all the graces of the spirit , is i believe the one most to be prayed for .	88.84766
although it is constantly made to look foolish ( too simple to come in out of the rain , people say , who have found in the innocent an impediment ) , it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks .	69.92383
it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best , and when they seem worst it overlooks them .	112.77924
to innocence , a word given is a word that will be kept .	39.052708
instinctively , innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by .	115.25258
but when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust , innocence can falter , since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it .	113.852455
the innocence of which i speak is , i know , not incorruptible .	69.07605
but i insist upon believing that even when it is lost , it may , like paradise , be regained .	51.940784
however , it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking , but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love .	113.00884
here , if anywhere , it is not wholly incontrovertible .	77.35397
to you , for instance , the word innocence , in this connotation , probably retained its biblical , or should i say technical sense , and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear by saying that i lost -- or rather handed over -- what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was legally entitled , and in fact by oath required , to hand it over along with what other goods and bads i had .	132.7438
but to me innocence is far less tangible .	12.267895
i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my trust in you , but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved , through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing , nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking , let alone with love .	172.32777
i knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time i acquired it	97.63954
today , these many years later , after all the temptations resisted or yielded to , the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured , i call it corrupting still .	98.29327
you , i could swear to it , remained innocent in this sense until the end .	208.77489
yours , but not mine , was an age in which innocence was fostered and carefully -- if not perhaps altogether innocently -- preserved .	184.89209
you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across her face .	82.256744
moreover , because of the particular blot on your family escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your grandmother ' s part , and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle bed of your childhood to outgrow , what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person , what you bent your whole will , sensibility , and intelligence upon , was to be a lady .	150.10562
before being daughter , wife , or mother , before being cultured ( a word now bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen bestowed on it ) , before being sorry for the poor , progressive about public health , and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian , indeed first and foremost , you were a lady .	207.98198
there was , of course , more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind ' s eye than the sine qua non of her virtue .	68.65389
a lady , you made clear to me both by precept and example , never raised her voice or slumped in her chair , never failed in social tact ( in heaven , for instance , would not mention st . john the baptist ' s head ) , never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company , never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture , never indulged in public scenes or private confidences , never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering , never gossiped or maligned , never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself .	121.32303
the songs sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments .	198.82455
often these listeners would refer sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties .	37.962547
in due time sandburg was a walking thesaurus of american folk music .	29.568262
after he had finished the first two volumes of his lincoln , sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him .	92.32785
he rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists .	70.30295
the result was a collection of 280 songs , ballads , ditties , brought together from all regions of america , more than one hundred never before published the american songbag .	57.858315
each song or ditty was prefaced by an author ' s note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the chorus and verses .	107.70656
the book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since .	156.78717
as sandburg said at the time `` it is as ancient as the medieval european ballads brought to the appalachian mountains , it is as modern as skyscrapers , the volstead act , and the latest oil well gusher ' ' .	43.549175
sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer .	9.925944
first , carl respects his audience and prepares his speeches carefully .	90.26514
even when he is called upon for impromptu remarks , he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes .	69.388214
he has his own system of shorthand , devised by abbreviations `` humility ' ' will be `` humly ' ' , `` with ' ' will be `` w ' ' , and `` that ' ' will be `` tt ' ' .	15.633392
the second reason for his popularity is his complete spontaneity with the guitar .	77.28002
it is a mistake , however , to imagine that sandburg uses the guitar as a prop .	64.79104
he is no dextrous-fingered college boy but rather a dedicated , humble , and bashful apostle of this instrument .	65.76966
at age seventy-four , he became what he shyly terms a `` pupil ' ' of andres segovia , the great guitarist of the western world .	32.452988
it is not easy to become segovia ' s pupil .	37.50666
`` his fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help in disciplining them .	78.63014
i found that this precocious , grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught .	85.401306
there has long existed a brotherly affection between us , thus i accepted him as my pupil .	176.94305
just as in the case of every prodigy child , we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to show up in the future -- if he should master all the strenuous exercises i inflicted on him .	112.82174
to play the guitar as he aspires will devour his three-fold energy as a historian , a poet and a singer .	57.084915
one cause of schopenhauer ' s pessimism was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar .	33.293495
i am certain that carl sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy .	68.54359
the heart of this great poet constantly bubbles forth a generous joy of life -- with or without the guitar ' ' .	112.84537
the public ' s identification of carl sandburg and the guitar is no happenstance .	30.581839
he is proud of having segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him titled `` the guitar ' ' .	37.221527
carl says it is the greatest poem ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem to that subtle instrument .	70.70898
`` a portable companion always ready to go where you go -- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant -- to be shared with few or many -- just two of you in sweet meditation ' ' .	79.33252
the new york herald tribune ' s photographer , ira rosenberg , tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a picture of carl playing a guitar .	32.92273
mr . rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one .	126.655365
`` preferably ' ' , said carl , `` one battered and worn , such as might be found in a pawnshop ' ' .	52.116364
they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller of 1162 sixth avenue .	34.288254
`` mr . miller was in the shop ' ' , the herald tribune story related , `` but was reluctant to have anybody ' s picture taken inside , because his business was too ' confidential ' for pictures .	72.769424
`` but after introductions he asked ' carl sandburg ? ?	13.961698
`` he wanted mr . sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop , but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully .	69.23433
' kalamazoo guitars ' , he said , ' used by radio hillbilly singers .	112.124435
`` he chose one from mr . miller ' s window , a plain guitar with no fancy polish .	42.90672
while the picture was taken , mr . miller ' s disposition to be generous to mr . sandburg increased to the point where he advised , ' i won ' t even charge you the one dollar rental fee ' ' ' .	79.16523
when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to be a celebrity , carl said , `` a celebrity is a fellow who eats celery with celerity ' ' .	49.544434
this has always been carl ' s attitude .	6.9932065
lloyd lewis wrote that when he first knew carl in 1916 , sandburg was making $27 . 50 a week writing features for the day book and eating sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants .	112.64129
he walked home at night for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley .	27.718826
when fame came it changed sandburg only slightly .	16.505817
lewis remembered another newspaperman asking , `` carl , have your ideas changed any since you got all these comforts ' ' ? ?	107.547516
carl thought the question over slowly and answered `` i know a starving man who is fed never remembers all the pangs of his starvation , i know that ' ' .	50.74279
that was all he said , lewis reports .	7.5692835
in answer to a new york times query on what is fame ( `` thoughts on fame ' ' , october 23 , 1960 ) , carl said `` fame is a figment of a pigment .	51.06362
another is a bubble of a bauble ' ' .	1.9054685
`` ah , did you once see shelley plain ' ' ? ?	12.151718
the impression you get from carl sandburg ' s home is one of laughter and happiness	51.17598
and the laughter and the happiness are even more pronounced when no company is present .	213.41066
carl has been married to paula for fifty-three years , and he has not made a single major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion with his wife .	59.45523
through all these years , mrs . sandburg has pointedly avoided the limelight .	75.73411
she has shared her husband ' s greatness , but only within the confines of their home	43.63037
it is a dedication which began the moment she met carl .	421.92715
mrs . sandburg received a phi beta kappa key from the university of chicago and she was busy writing and teaching when she met sandburg .	76.26122
`` you are the ' peoples ' poet ' ' ' was her appraisal in 1908 , and she stopped teaching and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husband ' s career .	41.842007
she has rarely been photographed with him and , except for carl ' s seventy-fifth anniversary celebration in chicago in 1953 , she has not attended the dozens of banquets , functions , public appearances , and dinners honoring him -- all of this upon her insistence .	68.4166
even now i will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts .	242.45857
the only way to describe paula sandburg is to say she is beautiful in a grecian sense .	52.545
her clothes , her hair , everything about her is both graceful and simple .	63.410717
she has small , broad , capable hands and an enormous energy .	95.038376
she is not only a trained mathematician and classicist , but a good architect .	30.293886
she designed and supervised the building of the harbert , michigan , house , most of which was constructed by one local carpenter who carried the heavy beams singly upon his shoulder .	99.63257
as the sandburg goat herd increased , she also designed the barn alterations to accommodate them .	150.09602
when erosion threatened the foundation of their home in harbert , paula sandburg planted grapevines and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the sands away .	93.07213
she was born lilian steichen , her parents immigrants from luxemburg .	76.056404
her mother called her paus ' l , a luxemburg endearment meaning `` pussycat ' ' .	15.259494
some of the children of the family could not pronounce this name and called her paula , a soubriquet carl liked so much she has been paula ever since .	113.97929
her parents , pious roman catholics , christened her mary anne elizabeth magdalene steichen .	52.57115
`` my mother read a book right after i was born and there was a lilian in the book she loved and i became lilian -- and eventually i became paula ' ' .	44.058136
this family of luxemburg immigrants , in fact , produced two exceptional children .	114.262695
paula ' s older brother is edward steichen , a talented artist and , for the past half-century , one of the world ' s eminent photographers .	24.427399
( two years ago the photography editor of vogue magazine titled his article about steichen , `` the world ' s greatest photographer ' ' .	20.063475
by the time lilian had been graduated from public school , her parents were doing quite well .	69.30575
her mother was a good manager and established a millinery business in milwaukee .	83.35257
but her father was not enthusiastic about sending young paula to high school .	180.38289
`` this is no place for a young girl ' ' , he said .	5.764145
the parents compromised , however , on a convent school and paula went to ursuline academy in london , ontario .	38.154774
she was pious , too , once kneeling through the night from holy thursday to good friday , despite the protest of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl .	79.808044
she knelt out of reverence for having read the meditations of st . augustine .	45.51671
she read everything else she could get her hands on , including an article ( she thinks it was in the atlantic monthly ) by mark twain on `` white slavery ' ' .	94.917046
paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in chapel .	249.77553
if there was ever a thought in her mind she might devote her life to religion , it was now dispelled .	71.674416
`` i felt that i must devote myself to the ' outside ' world ' ' .	23.398832
she passed the entrance examinations to the university of illinois , but during the year at urbana felt more important events transpired at the university of chicago .	36.578682
`` and besides , thorstein veblen was one of the chicago professors ' ' .	12.792334
at the university of chicago she studied whitman and shelley , and became a socialist .	47.971184
socialist leaders in milwaukee recognized her worth , not only because of her dedication but because of her fluency in german , french , and luxemburg .	43.765873
she once gave a german recitation before a convention of german-language teachers in milwaukee .	56.37876
carl and paula met in milwaukee in 1907 during paula ' s christmas holiday visit to her parents .	71.023445
he `` legitimized ' ' paula for lilian steichen , and it was paula who insisted on carl for charles .	108.2971
victor berger , the panjandrum of wisconsin socialism and member of congress , had asked paula steichen to translate some of his german editorials into english .	145.46828
carl , who was stationed in appleton , wisconsin , organizing for the social democrats , was in berger ' s office and made it his business to escort paula to the streetcar .	72.525925
she left the next day for her teaching job at princeton , illinois .	64.862015
( after graduation from the university of chicago , paula taught for two years in the normal school at valley city , north dakota , then two years at princeton ( illinois ) township high school .	62.393433
) by the time the streetcar pulled away , he had fallen in love with paula .	45.255936
paula says that even though carl ' s letters usually began , `` dear miss steichen ' ' , there was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband and wife .	54.19255
paula generously lent me one of carl ' s love letters , dated february 21 , 1908 , hotel athearn , oshkosh , wisconsin	57.474564
`` dear miss steichen it is a very good letter you send me -- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare i am carrying on up here .	87.74859
never until in this work of s-d organization have i realized and felt the attitude and experience of a teacher .	147.93674
the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice .	61.54377
certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the united states has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation	32.444485
by the same token , we reject any soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force or subversion .	65.40017
now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort .	58.513206
not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries	71.928116
we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them .	97.009186
we and our friends are , of course , concerned with self-defense .	42.450386
growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress , in freedom , of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations .	52.245716
these peoples , desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not , by our neglect , be forced to seek help from , and finally become virtual satellites of , those who proclaim their hostility to freedom .	140.47342
but they must have technical and investment assistance .	5.401159
this is a problem to be solved not by america alone , but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help .	116.99779
in recent years america ' s partners and friends in western europe and japan have made great economic progress .	65.61764
the international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the early postwar years .	14.026642
no longer is the united states the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries .	117.17326
to remain secure and prosperous themselves , wealthy nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope , confidence , and progress .	68.74591
a rich nation can for a time , without noticeable damage to itself , pursue a course of self-indulgence , making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens -- thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nations .	111.617714
but the enmities it will incur , the isolation into which it will descend , and the internal moral and spiritual softness that will be engendered , will , in the long term , bring it to economic and political disaster .	74.6658
america did not become great through softness and self-indulgence .	33.613586
her miraculous progress in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy and substantial adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious philosophy	306.71902
the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own best interests .	130.6721
to us and to every nation of the free world , rich or poor , these qualities are necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater security , prosperity and peace .	119.304344
i believe that the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing nations to achieve progress .	28.689991
the immediate need for this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation ' s international balance of payments .	40.068375
our surplus from foreign business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas , to finance private investment , and to provide assistance to the less developed nations .	77.03334
in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments approached four billion dollars .	167.74982
continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would , over time , impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world .	86.20441
we must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade .	67.60701
further , we must induce all industrialized nations of the free world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate .	61.384624
this co-operation in this matter will provide both for the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further increases in mutually profitable trade .	147.39624
new nations , and others struggling with the problems of development , will progress only -- regardless of any outside help -- if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it .	84.53215
moreover , progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned	139.45856
there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane .	52.091934
but , just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years , so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help .	160.1581
respecting their need , one of the major focal points of our concern is the south-asian region .	77.21501
here , in two nations alone , are almost five hundred million people , all working , and working hard , to raise their standards , and in doing so , to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty .	87.62344
i cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that , in our own and free world interest , we must co-operate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions , as expressed in their different multi-year plans .	93.01219
through the world bank and other instrumentalities , as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help , we must squarely face this titanic challenge .	119.92089
i shall continue to urge the american people , in the interests of their own security , prosperity and peace , to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully supported .	60.922752
free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom .	55.34644
other countries , some of which i visited last month , have similar needs .	267.7284
a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort .	47.20537
during the past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western nations .	72.10287
because of its wealth of experience , the organization for european economic cooperation could help with the initial studies needed .	132.46838
the goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized free world , especially private investment capital .	129.14941
by extending this help , we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom ' s banner .	113.545746
no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined .	43.62474
if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic advancement , we will make brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom .	103.92298
otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed .	3.8506217
we face , indeed , what may be a turning point in history , and we must act decisively and wisely .	64.07023
as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength .	119.49182
no matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction .	50.181633
until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions .	84.92695
it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support .	170.3391
it is world-wide knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack the united states by surprise , even though we might sustain great losses , would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction .	131.87022
but i once again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states , except in defense , will never turn loose this destructive power .	117.71722
during the past year , our long-range striking power , unmatched today in manned bombers , has taken on new strength as the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory .	37.130405
in fourteen recent test launchings , at ranges of five thousand miles , atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target .	70.61224
this is less than the length of a jet runway -- well within the circle of destruction .	127.247154
incidentally , there was an atlas firing last night .	3.7979395
from all reports so far received , its performance conformed to the high standards i have just described .	93.89429
such performance is a great tribute to american scientists and engineers , who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles , where america had none before .	68.44711
this year , moreover , growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will enter our active forces , some to be armed with polaris missiles .	75.41812
these remarkable ships and weapons , ranging the oceans , will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth .	110.70338
to meet situations of less than general nuclear war , we continue to maintain our carrier forces , our many service units abroad , our always ready army strategic forces and marine corps divisions , and the civilian components .	73.68041
the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process .	245.64214
it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength .	112.04432
the deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores , on land and sea , is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security .	101.78291
moreover , i have directed that steps be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to these allies .	135.5841
this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system .	23.796959
next i refer to our program in space exploration , which is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development .	39.89799
we note that , first , america has already made great contributions in the past two years to the world ' s fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science .	54.28478
these discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community	36.12381
but they are important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind .	43.18436
second , our military missile program , going forward so successfully , does not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines , which are necessary in distant space exploration .	77.8675
i am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements .	53.969254
third , the united states is pressing forward in the development of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes .	66.15121
fourth , in the meantime , it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth .	53.910187
using launch systems presently available , we are developing satellites to scout the world ' s weather	99.80079
satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe	31.844835
for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft	337.17078
and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek .	140.03925
fifth , we have just completed a year ' s experience with our new space law .	132.59286
suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly .	551.8569
the accomplishment of the many tasks i have alluded to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual , intellectual , and economic sinews of american life .	44.91132
the steady purpose of our society is to assure justice , before god , for every individual .	197.96886
we must be ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the issues of the day .	37.45171
a year ago , when i met with you , the nation was emerging from an economic downturn , even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful .	108.82693
today our surging strength is apparent to everyone .	27.691885
1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our history .	18.004967
yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders .	10.202583
among current problems that require solutions , participated in by citizens as well as government , are	123.61254
the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate	159.49391
the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture	64.25389
the continuing threat of inflation , together with the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility	39.0024
in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law .	67.94691
the group , upon the issuance of its first press release on december 21 , 1957 , designated itself a `` committee of investigation ' ' .	53.557217
in the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses .	338.74652
it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer , adolf a . berle , jr . , once .	33.628925
its second press release was on january 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed .	28.091139
it also implied that paul bang-jensen had been irresponsible .	48.561996
on january 18 , ernest gross conducted a press conference at the u . n . lasting an hour .	22.461164
here , he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct ' ' .	11.328208
this conference was held despite stavropoulos ' assurance to adolf berle , who was leaving the same day for puerto rico , that nothing would be done until his return on january 22 , except that the secretary general would probably order the list destroyed .	76.17393
on january 24 paul bang-jensen , accompanied by adolf berle , was met by dragoslav protitch and colonel frank begley , former police chief of farmington , conn . , and now head of u . n . special police .	30.660547
the four , bundled in overcoats , mounted to the wind-swept roof of the u . n .	17.396751
there , begley lit a fire in a wire basket , and bang-jensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames .	61.018612
in one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eighty-one refugees .	36.2566
the method of destroying the evidence embarrassed paul bang-jensen .	11.493225
he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence .	36.08959
he was right , and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordier ' s words on the subject , `` well , it seemed as good a place as any to do the job ' ' .	55.41124
the gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the secretary general .	43.424786
hammarskjold ' s supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of ernest gross is illusion , at best .	184.82086
gross ' s , being `` outside ' ' the u . n . applied only to a physical state , not an objective one .	54.486717
but by the time the papers were finally disposed of , the group had informed the world of its purpose , its recommendations , and its belief that paul bang-jensen was not of sound mind .	103.42901
shortly the group would issue its report to the secretary general , recommending paul bang-jensen ' s dismissal from the united nations .	30.218214
the contents of this 195-page document would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about .	101.96363
`` until this hungarian committee matter came up , bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual .	121.41255
i had known him for some years , when i was a delegate and before , and this manner had never been his ' ' .	54.084152
ernest a . gross leaned back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general dag hammarskjold had , on december 4 , 1957 , called him in as a private lawyer to review bang-jensen ' s conduct `` relating to his association with the special committee on the problem of hungary ' ' .	75.56914
the result was the `` gross report ' ' , prepared by gross , as chairman , with the assistance of two u . n . under secretaries , constantin stavropoulos and philippe de seynes .	40.835236
`` yes ' ' , gross went on , `` bang-jensen was an up-and-coming young man .	58.174576
never well known , but he had done his work competently .	200.67099
gross had received marshall courteously and they were discussing the case .	105.2942
`` you know ' ' , the lawyer said , `` it ' s difficult to talk like this about a man who can ' t answer back ' ' .	21.837135
gross was behind a clean-top desk , only a manila folder before him .	35.571472
marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs .	6.076428
outside the office windows , twenty-four stories above wall street , a light rain was falling .	105.46836
`` mr . gross , your report says that ' our function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate from or prejudice mr . bang-jensen ' s rights as a staff member .	114.079124
you know , bang-jensen characterized your committee as having prejudged his case ' ' .	49.41335
`` well , how could that have been ? ?	68.50765
i don ' t consider that he was prejudged .	118.142845
we were given a job and we carried it out , and later , his case was taken up by the disciplinary committee .	55.039543
`` we have nothing to hide under a bushel .	30.106247
we did our job , mr . stavropoulos and mr . de seynes and myself , taking evidence from a number of people ' ' .	33.92319
`` what did you think about his mental state ' ' ? ?	7.2807612
`` i think our report sums up our finding ' ' , gross answered .	22.278719
`` don ' t forget , here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report .	58.78086
`` this was not merely alleging errors , but was carried out by day-after-day allegations in memos , written charges of serious consequence .	66.555374
supposing you or i were being accused in this manner , and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work .	90.61501
`` i ' ve been in government and i can tell some pretty hairy stories about personnel difficulties , so i know what a problem he was ' ' .	101.11449
`` what i ' d like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your committee ' ' .	181.7394
`` what do you mean ' ' ? ?	1.0189996
`` for instance , regarding the fact that the gross committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation .	163.65916
you know bang-jensen was told the committee was ' to convey its views , suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general .	90.39367
in his own words , bang-jensen ' took it for granted that the group would report to the secretary general privately and not in public .	73.47626
he claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was ' prejudicial to his position ' ' ' .	30.761982
for an instant he glared speechless at marshall .	21.232635
`` i thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end .	81.419
but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press .	48.73854
it was getting so that we , the committee , were being tried .	205.48317
you can find it in the papers ' ' .	1.2879465
`` well , as a matter of fact , i ' ve looked through back-issue files of new york papers for december , 1957 , and haven ' t found a great deal ' ' --	51.111588
`` it wasn ' t necessarily all here in new york .	16.583607
don ' t forget the foreign press ' ' .	1.4149437
`` then what about the second interim public announcement ? ?	46.826004
this cited bang-jensen ' s ' aberrant conduct ' ' ' .	9.306547
`` the reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list .	50.223335
as far as i ' m concerned , it was a separate matter from the general committee study of bang-jensen ' s conduct .	66.247925
the january fifteen report recommended that bang-jensen be instructed to burn the list -- the papers -- in the presence of a u . n . security officer ' ' .	49.300194
`` how about your press conference three days later -- what was the reason for that ? ?	52.24357
bang-jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance to make sure the term ' aberrant conduct ' was not libelous .	68.69859
he claimed you made other slanderous allegations ' ' .	1.2333379
`` the entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list , since many in the press were querying the u . n . about it .	35.456924
bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession .	30.159561
`` it was foolish of him to keep them , whatever they were .	44.014576
he could have been blackmailed , or his family might have been threatened .	49.155888
of course the matter caught the public ' s attention .	19.80163
we attempted to conclude this , and did so by having the papers burned .	167.65106
hammarskjold didn ' t like the way it was carried out .	22.671406
hammarskjold believes the u . n . is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way .	120.70548
if hammarskjold had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner , and if bang-jensen had not wanted it -- who had ordered it ? ?	77.90586
`` mr . gross , concerning the formation of your committee , there ' s the fact that you have been a legal adviser to the u . n . in the past	24.96236
as i understand it , mr . hammarskjold wanted outside advice .	1228.1866
could you comment on that ' ' ? ?	1.0176847
`` i ' ve served as a counsel for the u . n . for some years , specializing particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular u . n . legal staff might not be equipped to handle .	58.0159
mr . stavropoulos is the u . n . legal chief and a very good man , but he is not fully versed on some technical points of american law ' ' .	40.986866
`` what did you think about bang-jensen ' s contention of errors and omissions in the hungarian report ' ' ? ?	40.047333
`` why , mick shann went over and over the report with alsing andersen , trying to check them out .	69.26617
even after the incident between bang-jensen and shann in the delegates ' lounge and this was not the way the chicago tribune presented it ' ' .	73.931206
gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings .	69.98777
one was an article on the u . n . by alice widener from the cincinnati enquirer .	54.042118
the other was by chesly manley in the chicago daily tribune .	42.587566
`` i know ches , he ' s a friend of mine .	21.626076
he probably didn ' t mean to write it this way , or maybe he did .	68.36582
there wasn ' t any ' violent argument ' between bang-jensen and shann , as the tribune puts it .	80.89668
that implies that shann was on the enemy side .	3.8257432
how it ' s phrased there -- the word violent .	126.95031
`` the case was that bang-jensen came up to shann claiming he had found further errors in the report .	60.65755
' i ' ve found errors and i want you to look them over .	111.68006
so once again shann had to argue with him about this .	67.24746
but it wasn ' t a violent discussion .	7.902376
and after all this , shann went over all that bang-jensen had brought up ' ' .	56.55553
( shann ' s own report , peter marshall reflected , describes the encounter as `` immoderate ' ' .	35.254173
bang-jensen was in `` hysterical condition ' ' .	3.0598307
it was a good report , he did all he could to make it a good report .	41.82293
when i speak of how shann felt , i know well .	54.28624
don ' t forget , i am an old member of the club , a former delegate .	21.54737
i think you are being unfair to take these things up now .	114.0436
`` you know , this hits in many areas .	46.51112
it appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the hungarian situation .	44.228573
don ' t forget , the u . n . did no more than the united states did .	21.233677
it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact ' ' .	33.08195
from the home of his friend , henrik kauffmann , in washington , d . c . , paul bang-jensen sent a telegram dated december 9 , 1957 , to ernest gross .	28.027735
`` the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character , and i therefore respectfully request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that i might make adequate preparation ' ' .	55.742264
ernest gross replied the next day , putting the suspended diplomat ' s fears to rest .	52.370052
`` this reveals some misunderstanding on your part .	23.538214
the group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings .	66.3872
it wished to pursue , in the course of this review , questions arising from the body of material already in its possession .	75.02286
it sounded like a fair enough invitation , peter marshall reflected , and bang-jensen must have thought so too , because on the thirteenth , he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth floor of the u . n . .	58.032413
`` we were requested by the secretary general , as i understand it , to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant , and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat .	68.670784
the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those of common sense , justice , and fairness ' ' .	69.830864
peter marshall noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with the gross group as `` unfortunate experiences ' ' , and after his second meeting on the sixteenth the dane refused to attend further hearings without legal counsel .	74.65074
marshall pondered the reason for this , and pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group .	79.8626
j . a . c . robertson , after serving gross one week , left for england .	310.5477
fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged .	40.165676
another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage .	104.88605
the sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon .	19.351114
in spite of pickering dodge ' s explicit instructions regarding variation of meals , the food did not seem the same as at home .	145.60236
`` everything tasted differently from what it does on land and those things i was most fond of at home , i loathed the most here ' ' , ann noted .	102.58699
at last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise .	199.6113
walking was the remedy , they decided , but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable .	143.4014
a rope was found and , like children in school , the missionaries skipped for hours at a time .	65.39028
finally , tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead .	81.167305
it was much more fun , reminding the girls of their old carefree days in the hasseltine frolics room at bradford .	75.06749
the weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites , although harriet was still a little off-color .	71.40819
she could not face coffee or tea without milk , and was always craving types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship .	105.88534
by now she was sure she was going to have a baby , deciding it would be born in india or burma that november .	69.17629
she was more excited than frightened at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land .	114.7186
the crew of the caravan never failed to amaze ann , who during her stay in salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language .	282.9422
she wrote in her journal , `` i have not heard the least profane language since i have been on board the vessel .	157.4315
she was now enjoying the voyage very much .	8.901403
even the first wave of homesickness had passed , although there were moments when captain heard pointed out on his compass the direction of bradford that she felt a little twinge at her heart .	75.5784
as for adoniram , she found him to be `` the kindest ' ' of husbands .	17.135975
on sundays , with the permission of captain heard , who usually attended with two of his officers , services were held in the double cabin .	65.27692
sometimes a ship would be sighted and the caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck .	82.862015
captain heard did not communicate with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united states and britain .	38.258965
as warmer temperatures were encountered ann and harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt water .	99.47382
when may came the caravan had already crossed the equator .	13.978822
they were sailing round the cape of good hope	955.585
at this time harriet wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother	118.95476
`` i care not how soon we reach calcutta , and are placed in a still room , with a bowl of milk and a loaf of indian bread .	55.933674
i can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury .	141.64471
i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel , and the almost intolerable smell after the rain , that i have done little more than lounge on the bed for several days .	58.415604
but i have been blest with excellent spirits , and to-day have been running about the deck , and dancing in our room for exercise , as well as ever ' ' .	52.225437
while studying at the seminary in andover , adoniram had been working on a new testament translation from the original greek .	89.53451
he had brought it along to continue during the voyage .	13.821357
there was one particular word that troubled his conscience .	80.40316
this was the greek word most often translated as `` baptism ' ' .	4.624181
born a congregationalist , he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water sprinkled on his head , yet nowhere in the whole of the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized by sprinkling .	76.186935
john the baptist used total immersion in the river jordan for believers	800.91113
the more adoniram looked at the greek word for baptism , the more unhappy he became over its true meaning .	164.43944
as was only natural he confided his searchings to ann , conceding ruefully that it certainly looked as if their own congregationalists were wrong and the baptists right .	119.73257
by this time she had learned that it was futile to argue with her young husband , yet the uncomfortable fact remained the american congregationalists were sending them as missionaries to the far east and paying their salaries .	125.68866
what would happen if adoniram `` changed horses in midstream ' ' ? ?	15.084459
baptists and congregationalists in new england were on friendly terms .	186.01648
how embarrassing it would be if the newly appointed congregationalist missionaries should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist teachings ! !	76.49373
`` if you become a baptist , i will not ' ' , ann informed her husband , but sweeping her threat aside adoniram continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he found himself .	105.94802
by early june they were a hundred miles off the coast of ceylon , by which time all four missionaries were hardened seafarers .	84.11694
even harriet could boldly write , `` i know not how it is	18.518114
and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel	2765.9949
ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two strange tropical birds .	61.004005
land was near , and on june 12 , one hundred and fourteen days after leaving america , they actually saw , twenty miles away , the coast of orissa .	79.228485
captain heard gave orders for the ship to be anchored in the bay of bengal until he could obtain the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters .	50.456287
sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but captain heard was lucky .	80.75885
next day a ship arrived with an english pilot , his leadsman , an english youth , and the first hindu the judsons and newells had ever seen .	45.818043
a little man with a `` a dark copper color ' ' skin , he was wearing `` calico trousers and a white cotton short gown ' ' .	49.61511
`` he looks as feminine as you can imagine ' ' , she decided .	32.159462
all day long the caravan slowly made her way through the difficult passages .	77.55149
alas , to ann ' s consternation , his language while thus employed left much to be desired .	306.1572
he swore so loudly at the top of his voice , that she didn ' t get any sleep all the next night .	37.653587
next morning the caravan was out of the treacherous bay .	127.69166
relieved of the major part of his responsibility for the safety of the ship , the pilot ' s oaths became fewer .	72.165955
slowly she moved up the hooghli river , a mouth of the mighty ganges , toward calcutta .	43.278866
ann was entranced with the view , as were her husband and friends .	139.0307
running across the deck , which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and eaten , they sniffed the spice-laden breezes that came from the shore , each pointing out new and exciting wonders to the other .	89.70844
out came the journal and in it went ann ' s own description of the scene	52.330887
`` on each side of the hoogli , where we are now sailing , are the hindoo cottages , as thick together as the houses in our seaports .	68.98984
they are very small , and in the form of haystacks , without either chimney or windows .	100.7797
they are situated in the midst of trees , which hang over them , and appear truly romantick .	108.94779
the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green , and herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river , and the natives are scattered about differently employed .	102.92124
some are fishing , some driving the team , and many are sitting indolently on the banks of the river .	31.248886
the pagodas we have passed are much larger than the houses ' ' .	10.038587
where were the hardships she had expected ? ?	1.1947107
she was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home in the big white house in haverhill .	127.67358
with childlike innocence she wrote of the indians as `` walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands , with the tawny children around them .	84.23114
this is the most delightful trial i have ever had ' ' , she decided .	31.986538
the indians who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly , even if she was suitably shocked , according to the customs of the society in which she had been reared , to find them `` naked , except a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle ' ' .	83.9334
at last they saw calcutta , largest city of bengal and the caravan ' s destination .	23.342873
founded august 24 , 1690 by job charnock of the east india company , and commonly called `` the city of palaces ' ' , it seemed a vast and elegant place to ann hasseltine judson .	41.075413
solid brick buildings painted dazzling white , large domes and tall , picturesque palms stretched as far as the eye could see , while the wharves and harbor were filled with tall-masted sailing ships .	42.929867
crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their strange-sounding bengali tongue .	8.973004
harriet ' s mouth watered with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last to her much-craved milk and fresh bread .	143.22052
ann , pleased to see her friend happy , was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of captain heard had sent on board for their enjoyment .	93.92895
cautiously she sampled her first pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of `` a rich pear ' ' .	49.470333
though she did not then know its name , this strange new fruit was a banana .	57.702374
the first act of adoniram and samuel on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station , a necessity when landing in east india company territory .	146.85689
on the way they tried to discover all they could about burma , and they were disturbed to find that michael symes ' s book had not presented an altogether true picture .	101.24175
he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself .	76.2103
they were in fact quietly laughing at him , for their king wished to have nothing to do with the western world .	57.624424
when captain john gibault of salem had visited burma in 1793 his ship , the astra , had been promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the irrawaddy river .	76.48089
although after much trouble he did manage to get it back , he discovered there was no trade to be had .	70.710365
all captain gibault took back to salem were a few items for the town ' s east india museum .	70.64323
a year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy .	48.253193
after that salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly burma .	4.506937
the burmese appeared to have little knowledge of british power or any idea of trade .	157.97067
cruel burmese governors could , on the slightest whim , take a man ' s life .	22.428686
as for missionaries , even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the christian faith to the burmans .	50.603596
unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate .	59.95447
`` go back to america or any other place ' ' , well-meaning friends of captain heard advised them , `` but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads ' ' .	86.98344
somewhat daunted , the two american missionaries reached the police station where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk .	70.47336
when he discovered they had received from the company ' s court of directors no permission to live in india , coupled with the fact that they were americans who had been sent to asia to convert `` the heathen ' ' , he became more belligerent than ever .	43.4973
they explained that they desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could be found .	153.33348
she describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this `` unseasonable exultation ' '	15.391578
he is answered by a confused , honest englishman .	12.119591
the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government , their delight at the prospect of a new war , their hopes of having the tories hanged , and so on .	84.99271
as for the author of the englishman , mrs . manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the protestant cause should be left to `` ridpath , dick steele , and their associates , with the apostles of young man ' s coffee-house ' ' .	64.44303
another controversy typical of the war between the englishman and the examiner centered on robert ( later viscount ) molesworth , a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish privy council .	39.863335
on december 21 , the day that the irish house of commons petitioned for removal of sir constantine phipps , their tory lord chancellor , molesworth reportedly made this remark on the defense of phipps by convocation `` they that have turned the world upside down , are come hither also ' ' .	119.95378
upon complaints from the lower house of convocation to the house of lords , he was removed from the privy council , his remark having been represented as a blasphemous affront to the clergy .	35.954018
steele , who had earlier praised molesworth in tatler no . 189 , now defended him in englishman no . 46 , depicting his removal as a setback to the constitution .	135.9108
on the other hand , molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press .	31.033342
swift , in the dublin edition of a preface to the bishop of sarum ' s introduction , indicated his feelings by including molesworth , along with toland , tindal , and collins , in the group of those who , like burnet , are engaged in attacking all convocations of the clergy .	43.157093
in the same way he coupled molesworth and wharton in a letter to archbishop king , and he had earlier described him as `` the worst of them ' ' in some `` observations ' ' on the irish privy council submitted to oxford .	61.84439
a month later , in the publick spirit of the whigs , he used steele ' s defense of molesworth as evidence of his disrespect for the clergy , calling steele ' s position an affront to the `` whole convocation of ireland ' ' .	48.469658
on this issue , then , as on so many in these months , steele and swift took rigidly opposed points of view .	129.12775
in the early months of 1714 , the battle between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its major phase .	134.80376
the preliminaries ended with the publication of steele ' s crisis on january 19 , and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace .	66.37751
in answer to the crisis , swift produced the publick spirit of the whigs , his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend .	53.51129
by this time , as we shall see , the tories were already planning to `` punish ' ' steele for his political writing by expelling him from the house of commons .	41.46531
despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech before the house , their efforts were successful .	60.36184
steele lost his seat in parliament , and his personal quarrel with swift , by now a public issue , thus reached its climax .	96.356064
of all the whig tracts written in support of the succession , the crisis is perhaps the most significant .	39.774258
certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate .	22.80661
hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation , said to have reached 40 , 000 , and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other government writers , the work must have had considerable impact .	111.37459
steele ' s main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a stuart restoration .	67.03974
to this end , the first and longest section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the revolution to defend england against the `` arbitrary power of a popish prince ' ' .	86.150375
in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes of current whig propaganda , ranging from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough	67.672165
but his principal theme is that the intrigues of the tories , `` our popish or jacobite party ' ' , pose an immediate threat to church and state .	36.833225
like burnet , he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis .	16.459179
treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession , he complains , are allowed to pass unnoticed .	57.173042
in this connection , swift , too , is drawn in for attack `` the author of the conduct of the allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession ' ' .	105.58727
in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy , steele goes so far as to list catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a stuart restoration , and , with rousing rhetoric , he asserts that the only preservation from these `` terrours ' ' is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited .	62.136135
`` it is no time ' ' , he writes , `` to talk with hints and innuendos , but openly and honestly to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put their designs in execution against us ' ' .	70.5732
steele apparently professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his own good , since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the house .	62.498245
in the final issues of the englishman , which ended just as the new session of parliament began , he provided his enemies with still more ammunition .	140.1518
for example , no . 56 printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke of cambridge .	98.25882
in a few months the duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant succession .	30.24109
at the order of the dowager electress , the hanoverian agents , supported by the whig leaders , demanded that a writ of summons be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in parliament , thus further insuring the succession by establishing a hanoverian prince in england before the queen ' s death .	63.697525
anne was furious , and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused .	98.5636
oxford , realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ , took the opposite view , for which the queen never forgave him .	62.771435
accordingly the request was granted , but the elector himself , who had not been consulted by his mother , rejected the proposal and recalled his agent schutz , whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the hanoverian interest to suffer and had made oxford ' s dismissal more likely than ever .	74.368004
steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan .	22.338865
a few days after this englishman appeared , defoe reported to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the duke be called over	101.47495
defoe then commented , `` if they could draw that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves quickly , for they are not asham ' d to say they want only a head to make a beginning ' ' .	155.81186
the final issue of the englishman , no . 57 for february 15 , ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet , entitled the englishman being the close of the paper so-called .	129.62868
steele ' s purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which had occupied him in the englishman	72.90209
but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift .	72.82809
thus he complains , with considerable justice , that the tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments .	132.3587
his birth , education , and fortune , he says , have all been ridiculed simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an englishman , and he assures the reader that `` whoever talks with me , is speaking to a gentleman born ' ' .	48.030632
as notable examples of this abuse , he quotes passages from the examiner , `` that destroyer of all things ' ' , and the character of richard steele , which he here attributes to swift .	78.21398
though put in rather maudlin terms , steele ' s defense of himself has a reasonable basis .	50.39199
his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal satire , despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of the sovereign .	78.011505
he claims , too , that his political convictions are simply those which are called `` revolution principles ' ' and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties .	67.58942
the final section of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of steele ' s relations with swift .	52.795734
it purports to be a letter from steele to a friend at court , who , in miss blanchard ' s opinion , could only be meant as swift .	51.874508
steele first answers briefly the charges which his `` dear old friend ' ' has made about his pamphlet on dunkirk and his crisis .	57.416847
then he launches into an attack on the tory ministers , whom he calls the `` new converts ' '	50.4428
by this term he means to ridicule their professions of acting in the interest of the church despite their own education and manner of life -- a gibe , in other words , at the `` presbyterianism ' ' in harley ' s family and at bolingbroke ' s reputed impiety .	40.4674
the tory leaders , he insinuates , are cynically using the church as a political `` by-word ' ' to increase party friction and keep themselves in power .	90.74884
this is the principal point made in this final section of englishman no . 57 , and it caps steele ' s efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the notion of the tories as a `` church party ' ' supported by the body of the clergy .	80.69872
next , steele turns his attention to the `` courtier ' ' he is addressing .	35.82247
he explains that there are sometimes honorable courtiers , but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice and ambition .	69.60863
such , he implies , is the case with his friend , who is not really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts .	56.448673
if `` jack the courtier ' ' is really to be taken as swift , the following remark is obviously steele ' s comment on swift ' s change of parties and its effect on their friendship `` i assure you , dear jack , when i first found out such an allay in you , as makes you of so malleable a constitution , that you may be worked into any form an artificer pleases , i foresaw i should not enjoy your favour much longer ' ' .	94.4376
he closes his `` letter ' ' by demanding that dunkirk be demolished , that the pretender be forced to move farther away from the coast of england , and that the queen and the house of hanover come to a better understanding .	68.71104
the last point was soon to be included in the `` seditious ' ' remarks used against him in parliament .	45.873634
the examiner , during steele ' s trial a month later , printed an answer from the `` courtier ' ' addressed to `` r . s . ' ' at button ' s coffee-house .	29.453533
he reviews steele ' s entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be credited to the indulgence of his friends .	92.04406
once more , in other words , steele is said to be indebted to swift for his `` wit ' '	58.989677
this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared in the tory press , especially the examiner .	60.14237
in the publick spirit of the whigs , it may be noted , swift himself contemptuously dismissed steele ' s reference to his friend at court `` i suppose by the style of old friend , and the like , it must be some body there of his own level	108.69256
among whom , his party have indeed more friends than i could wish ' ' .	27.374378
on february 16 , steele took his seat in parliament .	8.059631
by now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets , and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament .	73.46711
on the very day that the parliamentary session began , another `` infamous libel ' ' appeared , entitled a letter from the facetious dr . andrew tripe , at bath , to the venerable nestor ironside .	43.08399
it is filled with the usual personal abuse of steele , especially of his physical appearance	66.9156
in the opening paragraph , too , steele is accused of extreme egotism , of giving `` himself the preference to all the learned , his contemporaries , from dr . swift himself , even down to poet cr--spe of the customhouse ' ' .	109.784546
when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with johnny mercer , begun some years before .	56.006268
the film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled out of this world , a satire on the sinatra bobby-soxer craze .	59.143375
the twist lay in using bing crosby ' s voice on the sound track while leading man eddie bracken mouthed the words .	57.721058
if nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` out of this world ' ' and `` june comes around every year ' ' .	57.17997
though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on .	147.36975
early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled hot nocturne .	150.53784
it purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians , their aims , their problems -- the tug-of-war between the `` pure ' ' and the `` commercial ' ' -- and seemed a promising vehicle , for the two men shared a common interest in jazz .	69.47135
johnny mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears .	50.019936
he was born in savannah , georgia , in 1909 .	22.613895
his father , george a . mercer , was descended from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one hugh mercer , who had emigrated from scotland in 1747 .	127.60833
the lyricist ' s father was a lawyer who had branched out into real estate .	90.861984
his second wife , lillian , was the mother of john h . mercer .	43.471493
by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the call .	22.035887
one day he followed the irish jasper greens , the town band , to a picnic and spent the entire day listening , while his family spent the day looking .	100.25357
the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy .	58.366295
both were obviously on the way to the mercer home .	539.2042
the mother inquired , `` where ' s johnny , and why did you leave him ' ' ? ?	22.48757
`` there was nothing else i could do ' ' , the maid answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation .	73.12097
the maid then told her , `` because he fired me ' ' .	18.082626
with her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music -- though she waited until he was ten -- beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet .	168.51088
young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments .	90.89015
still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school , near orange , virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well .	56.809433
when he was fifteen john h . mercer turned out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called `` sister susie , strut your stuff ' ' .	46.670933
if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect .	79.28079
from his playmates in savannah , mercer had picked up , along with a soft southern dialect , traces also of the gullah dialects of africa .	103.57895
such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language .	56.41539
during the summers , while he was still in school , mercer worked for his father ' s firm as a messenger boy .	48.921642
it generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer ' s help .	65.179344
`` we ' d give him things to deliver , letters , checks , deeds and things like that ' ' , remembers his half-brother walter , still in the real estate business in savannah , `` and learn days later that he ' d absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket .	108.73989
this rather detached attitude toward life ' s encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in mercer ' s personality ever since .	68.09975
it is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not only has mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure .	106.31939
he has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman .	74.83104
in 1927 his father ' s business collapsed , and , rather than go bankrupt , mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation .	159.33063
he died before he could completely pay off his debts .	18.762733
some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation received a check for $300 , 000 , enough to clear up the debt .	53.059753
the check had been mailed from chicago , the envelope bore no return address , and the check was not signed .	80.110214
`` that ' s johnny ' ' , sighed the bank president , `` the best-hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded ' ' .	52.96809
but mercer ' s explanation was simple `` i made out the check and carried it around a few days unsigned -- in case i lost it ' ' .	78.29843
when he remembered that he might have not signed the check , mercer made out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other -- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly signed both of them .	154.97716
when the family business failed , mercer left school and on his mother ' s urging -- for she hoped that he would become an actor -- he joined a local little theater group .	98.67971
when the troupe traveled to new york to participate in a one-act-play competition -- and won -- mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in new york .	66.93162
he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to savannah .	188.44394
but mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up .	41.54636
`` the place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub ' ' , his mother discovered when she visited him .	26.815626
`` johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor -- he ' s always been a good cook -- and i ' ll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub ' ' .	45.010487
a story , no doubt apocryphal , for mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monacle in those village days .	299.22238
though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers .	72.03668
one day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle and broke it .	166.553
the innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle -- and did , over the protests of the former owner -- with a square monacle .	160.77306
mercer is supposed to have refused it with , `` anyone who wears a square monacle must be affected ' ' ! !	121.43276
everett miller , then assistant director for the garrick gaieties , a theatre guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written	68.917534
he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however .	26.055822
for him mercer produced the lyric to `` out of breath scared to death of you ' ' , introduced in that most successful of all the gaieties , by sterling holloway .	100.94274
this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke and ira gershwin , by e . y . harburg and duke , and by harry myers .	35.67375
entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song writer to take a wife , elizabeth meehan , a dancer in the gaieties .	68.588875
the mercers took up residence in brooklyn , and mercer found a regular job in wall street `` misplacing stocks and bonds ' ' .	33.328434
when he heard that paul whiteman was looking for singers to replace the rhythm boys , mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , i ' m sure , but because i could write songs and material generally ' ' .	64.38335
while with the whiteman band mercer met jerry arlen .	21.66188
he had yet to meet harold arlen , for although they had `` collaborated ' ' on `` satan ' s li ' l lamb ' ' , mercer and harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them .	96.041756
the lyric , mercer remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody .	45.74686
mercer ' s whiteman association brought him into contact with hoagy carmichael , whose `` snowball ' ' mercer relyriced as `` lazybones ' ' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of mercer ' s song-writing career .	34.679585
after leaving whiteman , mercer joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist .	23.655043
with the help of ziggy elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional jewish melody into a popular song , `` and the angels sing ' ' .	40.75695
the countrywide success of `` lazybones ' ' and `` and the angels sing ' ' could only lead to hollywood , where , besides harold arlen , mercer collaborated with harry warren , jimmy van heusen , richard whiting , walter donaldson , jerome kern , and arthur schwartz .	40.351257
mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs .	52.16934
he may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the u . s . treasury	19.72001
he collaborated on a song with william hartman woodin , who was secretary of the treasury , 1932-33 .	25.170698
when johnny mercer and harold arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , mercer , like arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` hooray for hollywood ' ' , `` ride , tenderfoot , ride ' ' , `` have you got any castles , baby ? ?	75.175514
' ' , and `` too marvelous for words ' ' ( all with richard whiting )	60.826065
with harry warren he did `` the girl friend of the whirling dervish ' ' , `` jeepers creepers ' ' , and `` you must have been a beautiful baby ' ' .	11.770604
mercer ' s lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair .	41.31403
though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the best of them , mercer ' s forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit .	32.266373
his casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change from harburg ' s , so that arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration .	124.534294
there were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .	128.94328
speaking of his work with johnny mercer , arlen says , `` our working habits were strange .	75.130905
after we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out , we ' d get together for an hour or so every day .	78.71988
while johnny made himself comfortable on the couch , i ' d play the tunes for him .	32.874718
after i would finish playing the songs , he ' d just go away without a comment .	83.75242
i wouldn ' t hear from him for a couple of weeks , then he ' d come around with the completed lyric ' ' .	35.64104
arlen is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer mercer has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings in arlen ' s study .	56.355434
`` some guys bothered me ' ' , mercer has said .	39.200138
`` i couldn ' t write with them in the same room with me , but i could with harold .	54.653423
he often uses very odd rhythms , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer ' ' .	33.81983
while arlen and mercer collaborated on hot nocturne , mercer worked also with arthur schwartz on another film , navy blues .	356.4546
arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend ted koehler .	33.290455
besides doing a single song , `` when the sun comes out ' ' , they worked on the ambitious american-negro suite , for voices and piano , as well as songs for films .	42.458252
the american-negro suite is in a sense an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection of negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage .	69.185196
the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which koehler set the words `` there ' ll be no more work	86.57309
there ' ll be no more worry ' ' , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot .	51.628384
this grew into the song `` big time comin ' ' ' .	8.911709
by september 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby ' ' .	25.874113
the negro composer hall johnson studied the american-negro suite and said of it , `` of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a negroid idiom in both words and music , these six songs by harold arlen and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest .	96.989075
thoroughly modern in treatment , they are at the same time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average ' broadway spirituals ' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the ' amen corner ' , ' judgement day , ' gabriel ' s horn , and a frustrated devil -- with a few random hallelujahs thrown in for good measure .	95.24457
it had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards .	61.295795
it was here that the terror-stricken dennis moon played an unrehearsed role during the children ' s party .	41.127243
a much larger room , adjacent to the lavatory , served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet .	67.12889
that unused room was large enough for -- well , say an elephant could get into it and , as a matter of fact , an elephant did .	69.85388
something occurred on the morning of the children ' s party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us .	89.92193
it so happened that sports writer arthur robinson got out of the hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he be back in an hour or two to continue his convalescence .	121.38888
arthur robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the american .	97.94741
he was ghost writer for babe ruth , whose main talent for literary composition was the signing of his autograph .	96.296684
robbie was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees .	5.66635
he arrived on crutches at the newspaper club with one of his great pals , oliver herford , artist , author , and foe of stupidity .	43.76824
mr . herford ' s appearance was that of a frustrated gnome .	22.548622
he seemed timid ( at first , ) wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon dangled , and was no bigger than a jockey .	38.938156
robinson asked herford to escort him to the club ' s lavatory before they sat down for a highball and a game of cards .	58.219837
in the jakes , after robbie and his crutches were properly stowed , mr . herford went to the adjoining facility .	38.48331
he had barely assumed his stance there when a fat fellow charged through the doorway .	164.9599
without any regard for rest-room protocol , the hulking stranger almost knocked herford off his pins .	177.37456
the artist-author said nothing , but stood to one side .	27.848713
the unrelieved stranger eventually turned away from the place of his -- shall we dare say his waterloo ? ?	232.21413
mr . herford touched the fat man ' s arm .	20.409054
may i say that you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb -- the younger pliny ' s , if memory serves me -- which , translated freely from the archaic latin , says , ' the more haste , the less peed ' ' ' .	81.47142
governor alfred e . smith was the official host at the children ' s party .	63.292847
united states senator royal s . copeland was wearing the robes of santa claus and a great white beard	45.437634
the honorable robert wagner , sr . , at that time a justice of the new york supreme court , was on the reception committee .	41.585426
i was in charge of the arrangements -- which were soon enough disarranged .	102.90274
i had had difficulties from the very first day .	18.479853
when , in my enthusiasm , i proposed the party , my city editor ( who disliked the club and many of its members ) tried to block my participation in the gala event .	115.80694
even earlier than that he had resented the fact that i had been chosen to edit the club ' s reporter .	27.082855
city editor victor watson of the new york american was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious shifts of mood .	58.20779
mr . hearst ' s telegraphic code word for victor watson was `` fatboy ' ' .	21.46911
the staff saw in him the qualities of a don cossack , hence , as mentioned before , his nickname `` the hetman ' ' .	72.18712
the hetman ' s physical aspects were not those of a savage rider of the steppes .	87.500694
indeed , he looked more like a well-fleshed lay brother of the hospice of st . bernard .	77.35228
he had a purring voice and poker player ' s immobility of features which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried .	83.85787
he was the son of a scottish father and an american jewish mother , long widowed , with whom he lived in a comfortable home in flushing .	47.831608
he had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old , always for the hearst service .	65.374695
from the very first he regarded himself as mr . hearst ' s disciple , defender , and afterward his prime minister , self-ordained .	46.60463
it was said that the hetman plotted to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various coups the destruction of editors who tried to halt his course , the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to mr . hearst .	150.68393
whatever the hetman ' s ambitions , his colleagues were kept ill at ease .	140.9769
among the outstanding members of the hearst cabinet whom he successfully opposed for a time were the great arthur brisbane , bradford merrill , s . s . carvalho , and colonel van hamm .	44.605034
he also disliked runyon , for no good reason other than the fact that the demon ' s talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the hetman ' s say-so or his supervision .	64.20241
runyon , for his part , had a contemptuous regard for mr . watson .	233.65585
`` he ' s a wrong-o ' ' , said runyon , `` and i wouldn ' t trust him as far as i could throw the statue of liberty ' ' .	21.127796
arthur `` bugs ' ' baer wrote to me just recently , `` vic wanted to die in harness , with his head towards the wagon .	92.9444
he supported his mother and his brother , who afterwards committed suicide .	188.28056
watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother , blossoms bought with vic ' s allowance to him .	69.86847
' and would you believe it ' , vic added , ' she likes him better than she does me .	195.25572
about the only time the hetman seemed excited was when one of his own pet ideas was born .	122.834305
then he would get to his feet , as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers , and say almost invariably , `` gentlemen , this is an amazing story ! !	124.39404
it ' s bigger than the armistice ' ' .	1.4367057
some of the hetman ' s `` ideas ' ' were dream-ridden , vaguely imparted , and at times preposterous .	41.33808
one day he assigned me to lay bare a `` plot ' ' by the duponts to supply munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur in cuba .	74.69532
he said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip .	60.823975
`` i can tell you this much ' ' , he said .	3.4406445
it ' s bigger than the armistice ' ' .	1.4367057
i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources .	119.14623
then i spent the next two days at the baseball park and at jack doyle ' s pool parlors .	44.364655
when i returned to make my report , the hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission .	100.72633
he was busy , he said , in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation .	223.09987
and i was to go to work on that odd matter .	232.87425
the hetman had a strong liking for a story , any story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods .	105.27357
most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts , and not as a rule by playing clever tricks .	107.168076
one day i tired of following the hetman ' s advice of `` shadowing ' ' and of the `` ring-around-the-rosie ' ' approach to a report that enrico caruso had pinched a lady ' s hip while visiting the central park monkey house .	52.279007
i explained my state of mind to artist winsor mccay and to `` bugs ' ' baer .	19.714798
mr . baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the friars .	33.1342
we fashioned beards , put them on , and reported to the hetman at the city desk .	91.0141
mr . baer had an auburn beard , like longfellow ' s .	14.687197
mr . mccay had on a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache .	71.84177
as for myself , i had on an enormous black `` muff ' ' .	30.290518
this , together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses , gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist .	20.246763
`` we are ready for your next mysterious assignment ' ' , said mr . baer to the hetman .	27.625378
`` where to , sir ' ' ? ?	1.1325397
mr . watson did not have much humor in his make-up , but he managed a mirthless smile .	26.13374
just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder .	149.11635
the hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it .	61.226677
while i was sitting at one of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard , arthur brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand .	66.52298
he paused for a moment to look at me , then went on to the city desk to deliver his `` today ' ' column .	58.929123
i thought it expedient to take off my derby , my glasses , and the beard	46.50941
i managed to do this by the time the great a . b . returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist .	102.518814
he stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk .	171.7695
then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly out of the room .	24.943632
he had been `` seeing things ' ' .	3.8409567
the hetman ' s `` ideas ' ' for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless or lacking in merit .	123.53182
he campaigned successfully for the riddance of `` death avenue ' ' and also brought about the ending of pollution of metropolitan beaches by sewage .	102.751045
he exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , nat ferber and carl helm .	118.37529
in the conduct of these and many other campaigns , the hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed .	106.949585
it seems to me now , in a long backward glance , that many of the hetman ' s conceits and odd actions -- together with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet in the name of mr . hearst -- were keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day .	65.75878
alone , rejected on every hand , divorced , and in financial trouble , he leaped from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937 .	72.576126
one finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol , w . r . hearst .	124.19983
that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair .	94.70343
the unfinished note , written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope , and addressed to the coroner , makes one wonder about many things `` god forgive me for everything .	91.09951
much to damon runyon ' s amazement , as well as my own , i got along splendidly with the hetman	56.510296
that is , until i became an editor , hence , in his eyes , a rival .	49.42405
not long after colonel van hamm had foisted me on the watson staff i received a salary raise and a contract on the hetman ' s recommendation .	79.74456
during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the hearst service .	105.0079
it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists .	69.83423
i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement .	405.5199
somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his foe , colonel van hamm , wouldn ' t touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil .	51.610855
i remember one day when mr . hearst ( and i never knew why he liked me , either ) sent the hetman a telegram `` please find some more reporters like that young man from denver ' ' .	128.635
watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm .	8.795359
the colonel grunted , then made a remark which might be construed in either of two ways .	98.57564
`` don ' t bother to look any further .	64.642365
we already have the only one of its kind ' ' .	9.184052
the hetman did have friends , but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession .	105.25971
sergeant mike donaldson , congressional medal of honor soldier , was one of them .	34.99363
dr . menas s . gregory was another .	17.002201
i used to go with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment , to sit among the doctor ' s excellent collection of statues , paintings , and books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable .	110.76447
there was one time , however , when his face clouded and he suddenly blurted , `` why did my brother commit suicide ' ' ? ?	29.567057
i cannot remember dr . gregory ' s reply , if , indeed , he made one .	69.81152
if she were not at home , mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there .	92.06614
sometimes , mrs . coolidge would close herself in the green suite on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the white house .	35.164425
mama knew she was playing her son ' s favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not disturb her .	51.264164
all the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic loss , even though the president tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him .	76.8385
a little boy came to give the president his personal condolences , and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in .	75.240685
backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to mrs . coolidge .	40.765522
the president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been before the tragedy .	122.28245
he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips .	130.23094
dresses were short in the days of mrs . coolidge , and spanish shawls were thrown over them .	17.402374
one shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she draped it over the banister on the second floor , and it hung over the stairway .	35.481678
the president used to look at it with a ghost of a smile .	25.391157
mrs . coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection .	345.94083
she kept the dolls on the lincoln bed .	1.915953
at night , when mama would turn back the covers , she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night .	79.38002
mama always felt that the collection symbolized mrs . coolidge ' s wish for a little girl .	16.646906
among the dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady , who would pick it up and look at it often .	74.657646
it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist .	2.9946506
an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for mrs . coolidge ' s first granddaughter .	23.199255
mama knew this doll was meant to help mrs . coolidge overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future .	63.085724
the name inside the envelope was `` cynthia ' ' .	2.5265002
the coolidges ' life , after the death of their son , was quieter than ever .	47.873493
john was away at school most of the time .	15.695567
mrs . coolidge would knit , and the president would sit reading , or playing with the many pets around them .	180.37833
now and then , the president would call for `` little jack , master of the hounds ' ' , which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the white house since teddy roosevelt ' s administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals .	52.733036
it was part of little jack ' s work to look after the dogs .	72.046295
one white house dog was immortalized in a painting .	66.09493
that was rob roy , who posed with mrs . coolidge for the portrait by howard chandler christy .	63.321373
to get him to pose , mrs . coolidge would feed him candy , so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did .	65.8144
i would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress mrs . coolidge is wearing in this painting .	77.34166
it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian .	117.563965
people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on .	281.53275
the dress in the painting is a bright red , with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side .	22.76306
there is a long train flowing from the shoulders .	39.00354
mrs . coolidge gave mama this dress for me , and i wore it many times .	27.277681
i still have the dress , and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution as a memento , or , as i more fondly hope , to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the presidents -- if i can get it organized .	136.69937
but to get back to the coolidge household , mrs . coolidge so obviously loved dogs , that the public sent her more dogs -- calamity jane , timmy , and blackberry .	71.10023
the last two were a red and a black chow .	14.140085
rob roy remained boss of all the dogs .	5.365449
he showed them what to do , and taught them how to keep the maids around the white house in a state of terror .	59.651485
the dogs would run through the halls after him like a burst of bullets , and all the maids would run for cover .	63.998444
mama didn ' t know what to do -- whether to tell on rob roy or not -- since she had the ear of mrs . coolidge more than the other maids .	74.38109
but she was afraid the first lady would not understand , because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first family .	67.06506
every day , when the president took his nap , rob roy would stretch out on the window seat near him , like a perfect gentleman , and stare thoughtfully out the window , or he would take a little nap himself .	78.35617
he would not make a sound until the president had wakened and left for the office	90.54699
then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear .	111.917984
his signal was for the other dogs to come running , but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch out .	53.985573
rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to his office every morning .	94.66957
rob roy was well aware of the importance of this mission , and he would walk in front of the president , looking neither to the right nor to the left .	47.887547
at dinner , lunch , or breakfast , the president would call out , `` supper ' ' ! !	40.686802
-- he called all meals supper -- after the butler had announced the meal .	95.78747
all the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to the dining room .	26.348238
they would all lie around on the rug during the meal , a very pretty sight as rob roy , prudence , and calamity jane were all snow-white .	94.32108
when prudence and blackberry were too young to be trusted in the dining room , they were tied to the radiator with their leashes , and they would cry .	42.990112
mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first family returned .	72.722664
finally , mama did mention to mrs . coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs , and then mrs . coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone , even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity .	64.93146
mama was now the first maid to mrs . coolidge , because catherine , the previous first maid , had become ill and died .	59.854126
mrs . coolidge chose mama in her place .	6.9208484
every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship .	567.80975
for the coolidges , it was mr . and mrs . frank w . stearns of boston , massachusetts , owners of a large department store .	32.02368
they seemed to be at the white house half the time .	111.558395
the butlers were amused because when the stearns were there , the president would say grace at breakfast .	162.28183
if the stearns were not there , grace would be omitted .	40.395813
speaking of breakfast , the president inaugurated a new custom -- that of conducting business at the breakfast table .	103.797134
the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part .	80.20856
a new bill had been passed under harding that designated the government , rather than the president , as the tab-lifter for official meals .	127.58819
so the president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government officials to attend .	101.40806
he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate .	168.39345
mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful , mr . coolidge certainly made a good president .	45.883995
he knew exactly how to be colorful ! !	1.2550274
the favorite guest of the house , as far as the staff was concerned , was mr . wrigley , the chewing gum king .	62.957558
the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more , and every christmas , mr . wrigley sent the president a check for $100 , to be divided among all the help .	65.14551
you can imagine that he got pretty good service .	126.528175
another good friend of the coolidges ' was george b . harvey , who was the ambassador to great britain from 1921 to 1923 .	42.490047
he had been a friend of the hardings , and continued to be invited by the coolidges .	32.148846
the first royalty whom mama ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania , who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 , 1926 .	66.08402
she was not an overnight guest in the white house , but mr . ike hoover , the chief usher , had mama check her fur coat when she came in , and take care of her needs .	60.833225
mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen .	25.447945
mama was very patriotic , and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the white house .	51.6892
actually , two flags were used at the mansion -- a small one on rainy days , and a big one on bright days .	121.65514
the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind , and mama would mend it .	54.37933
she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening .	71.21329
she used to tell me , `` when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way , i have the wonderful , safe feeling that americans are protected no matter which way the wind blows ' ' .	88.853714
even when mrs . coolidge was in mourning for her son , she reached out to help other people in trouble .	43.4759
mama had told her how emmett ' s lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war .	50.13256
he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number of times .	141.53796
taking a personal interest , she had the doctor assigned to the white house , dr . james coupal , look emmett over .	46.401943
as a result , he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service .	81.759186
but again , there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy washington weather , and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work .	48.54892
when mrs . coolidge was in mourning , she did not wear black .	86.4751
she wore grey every day , and white every evening .	198.46365
mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors .	94.6432
the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started .	132.20297
she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face .	25.673567
on the social side , the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the white house thrilled her the most .	52.227146
it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs , and , just as the first lady stepped off the last tread , mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the blue room to greet her guests with the president .	50.384136
mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night .	137.30064
one night , mama came home practically in a state of shock .	44.500267
she had stood at the bottom of the stairs , as usual , when mrs . coolidge came down , in the same dress that is now in the smithsonian , to greet her guests .	55.626385
mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ! !	45.70998
she reached and reached around the dress , but there was nothing there .	25.420372
she looked up and saw that , without knowing it , mrs . coolidge was holding it aloft .	38.206116
mrs . coolidge looked down , saw mama ' s horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor .	64.082886
mama swirled the train in place , and not a step was lost .	216.77687
the coolidges did not always live at the white house during the presidency .	33.669945
impressive as this enumeration is , it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of jews , collectively or individually , that have been attested by their gentile environment .	85.88905
it is reasonable to affirm two propositions jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things to all men	65.853516
some jews have in fact been all things to all men .	28.42561
in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody ' s ally	153.85568
in the market place jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers , or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors .	59.57127
and so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph .	30.502766
but the two do not invariably or even typically coincide .	419.18362
the `` conventional ' ' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research .	72.62684
conventional images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant images can be both true and false .	97.46632
the genuinely interesting question , then , becomes what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of jews ? ?	91.89127
the working test of `` the facts ' ' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations .	150.06046
granted , such `` functional ' ' images are subject to human error	95.43501
they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error .	236.03096
in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished current intelligence	206.75299
general grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book	156.89778
if so , he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future .	172.50331
he may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs .	57.10332
predispositions , in turn , fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis .	78.42387
to some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments .	24.072895
in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality .	18.608839
the anti-semitism of hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of lueger ' s politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna .	56.21501
but millions of human beings were exposed to lueger ' s propaganda and record .	58.951916
after allowing for group exposures , it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism .	40.763798
they include harmonies and conflicts within the whole man , and mechanisms whereby inner components are more or less smoothly met .	169.16621
modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind .	41.54643
the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it .	116.83774
undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality .	76.797874
many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal .	253.23344
undoubtedly , however , the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest .	41.357735
speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy .	34.14904
since we can neither undo nor redo the past , we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow .	55.119198
in this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local , national , and world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having some effect , large or small , upon gentile-jewish relations .	129.09843
i am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in gentile-jewish relations .	21.076807
comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method .	102.210526
the tasks are briefly indicated by these questions what are my goals in gentile-jewish relations ? ?	101.64275
what are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized ? ?	38.92824
what factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places ? ?	36.438396
what is the probable course of future developments ? ?	6.186769
what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values ? ?	103.937454
it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range .	291.544
the discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy .	80.02782
as a groundwork for the proposal i give some attention to the first task enumerated above , the clarification of goal .	74.46207
my reply is that i associate myself with all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity .	49.709778
the basic goal finds partial expression in the universal declaration of human rights , a statement initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many religious and philosophical traditions .	70.86374
within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved , as well as upon the nature of the claim , the characteristics of the claimant , the justifications proposed , and the predispositions of the community decision makers who are called upon to act .	69.43866
if jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal , it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship .	63.163383
when decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion .	58.576267
since the recognition of israel as a nation state , claims are made in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body politic .	54.2493
community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states .	162.85072
in free countries many controversies involve self-styled jews who use the symbol in asserting a vaguely `` cultural ' ' rather than religious or political identity .	69.49411
the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups .	100.24387
we know that much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the key symbol of the jew .	84.79549
many public and private controversies will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in the mind and usage of gentile and jew .	67.69085
however , in the context of legal and civic policy , these controversies are less than novel .	99.98575
they involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-jewish groups .	32.766335
so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned , categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships	93.2015
claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties .	141.55005
it is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews and gentiles during coming years .	91.19169
but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost .	282.09094
in conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net advantage , taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration .	112.55045
it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate	266.26312
for instance , imagine the situation if israel ever joins an enemy coalition .	301.62405
the formal position of americans who identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the jewish symbol is already clear	53.65402
the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed .	51.13238
when we consider the disorganized state of the world community , and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as jews , it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill .	66.62469
during moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming .	75.88003
but their freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which they and the people around them enter the crisis .	57.54858
at such critical moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously `` pay off ' ' .	105.277176
by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact , with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified .	127.34221
among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control .	169.99359
we are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society	91.24907
a truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best .	226.61154
during intercrisis periods the educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every age and condition .	77.46435
as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected .	98.347694
now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach	21.27485
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good .	49.108788
in any case i do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions .	166.50876
i assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small , and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others .	143.69594
properly used , the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment .	31.211475
let us not confuse the issue by labeling the objective or the method `` psychoanalytic ' ' , for this is a well established term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated by sigmund freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered personalities .	64.66962
the traditional method proceeds by the technique of free association , punctuated by interpretations proposed by the psychoanalytic interviewer .	101.40254
what we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods by which they are sought .	78.360725
for what we propose , however , a psychoanalyst is not necessary , even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses -- his defenses of himself to himself .	72.1516
for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary	84.47267
but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind .	168.20213
the relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said , whether he responds with anger or applause .	92.48493
self-discovery calls for an open , permissive , inquiring posture of self-observation .	30.007635
the symposium provides an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were addressing definite audiences -- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification .	161.44463
an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself , resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the jew .	55.012253
two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time .	199.07832
one , a reservation on the point i have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking , pseudo-feeling , and pseudo-willing , which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom .	73.344955
in essence this involves grounding one ' s thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one ' s own values and experience .	47.909348
there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else .	74.74666
clearly what the person brings to the reading is important .	47.151863
moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking	71.96949
if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity .	43.78417
the second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today .	100.049515
in the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation .	170.76566
the reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different ' ' ? ?	45.547276
and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .	28.459068
the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .	110.07824
and this , i think , holds for values as well as life styles .	71.84245
after all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) reader ' s digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character i ever met ' ' deals with village grocers , country doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and so forth .	92.31385
scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too .	73.15497
but still , the proposition is worth examination .	5.6013446
it is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right ' ' and `` wrong ' ' .	39.739857
both flugel and ranyard west deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber .	80.69699
it forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy .	203.9365
i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience -- most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of course , to the influence of religion .	55.90725
still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one ' s ideas of right and wrong	87.76893
certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence .	156.05783
probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .	95.27382
this is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it .	125.94706
in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .	84.64843
literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance .	56.501564
this , no doubt , is part of what gilbert seldes implies when he says of the arts , `` they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense ' ' .	94.30615
men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .	98.49905
feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .	24.589058
a need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so to speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature .	96.12661
the terms `` renewal ' ' and `` refreshed ' ' , which often come up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal ' ' of purpose and a `` refreshed ' ' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction .	69.21776
the notion of `` inspiration ' ' is somehow cognate to this feeling .	64.7621
how literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message ' ' , as well as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose .	52.124928
one of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion .	100.24253
let us differentiate a few of these ideas .	9.986576
the aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one .	26.265242
the idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , plato ' s notion of the arousal of emotion .	62.172825
a third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts , giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals .	96.00911
this is given some expression in beardsley ' s notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision .	25.988018
a fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in housman ' s fine phrase on the arts they `` transform and beautify our inner nature ' ' .	34.29527
it is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .	36.580322
f . s . c . northrop , in his discussion of the `` functions and future of poetry ' ' , suggests this `` one of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects .	67.09283
if art is to release us from these postulated things ( things we must think symbolically about ) and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these common sense entities ' ' .	97.31154
i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it .	108.08975
richards ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses .	196.97151
a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these .	37.32367
but there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention .	52.49883
in the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate .	100.33554
the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way .	60.079132
william wimsatt and cleanth brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected `` for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) -- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at all .	82.06031
something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like `` expressions ' ' of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement ' ' .	76.56561
the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience .	97.33874
here i do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion .	60.46929
i mean something more like freud ' s concept of the utility of `` play ' ' to a small child he plays `` house ' ' or `` doctor ' ' or `` fireman ' ' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control .	51.812717
there is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time .	76.935616
in b . m . spinley ' s portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .	89.909546
perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation .	89.06318
anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean .	121.45251
it is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .	66.81309
in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with respect to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature ' ' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required .	57.12767
in the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden , or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of words ? ?	87.67498
these are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing .	81.63756
one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide .	56.897705
sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill .	80.92488
among other things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences .	52.13364
both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged .	68.700005
its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre .	112.97291
the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment contrast the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty .	183.21616
along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have seen .	239.53766
in a symposium and general exploration of the field of personal perception and interpersonal behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception	85.48492
solomon asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events .	73.29335
but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .	107.53654
i would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what i shall call depth .	74.32812
i use this term to mean three things a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .	84.22909
it is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia .	12.083396
i think these attributes cluster , but i have no evidence .	52.9692
in fact , i can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .	77.52291
the late r . g . collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote ``	107.93369
we are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with chaucer and cimabue , or even shakespeare and titian .	61.790714
by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and japanese colour-prints	71.05803
but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place .	52.86051
the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else ' ' .	68.62545
one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper critic , and of the creative artist himself .	71.0724
there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .	54.46456
the study of ideas in literature is one of these .	31.397518
of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene .	143.11525
the continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other .	128.24878
when we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption .	47.281616
most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them .	60.052784
many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .	177.36517
this understanding , of course , may in its turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical .	122.394104
but the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture ' ' , or technique .	52.045265
it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight .	120.737206
but , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other .	52.280518
at this point a working definition of idea is in order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed .	101.118576
the term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience .	135.38403
it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .	108.180244
an idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned .	90.263725
in this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so to speak `` writ large ' ' in history of literature where they recur continually .	109.64747
outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries	104.08416
also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man .	21.319319
one might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in so far as it includes the literatures , must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning .	77.94989
we need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature .	88.10732
an idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .	128.25146
thus burns ' s `` my love is like a red , red rose ' ' and hopkins ' `` the thunder-purple sea-beach , plumed purple of thunder ' ' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .	110.07809
on the other hand , arnold ' s `` the unplumbed , salt , estranging sea ' ' , taken in its context , certainly does so .	75.68129
understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies .	88.77232
thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period .	121.45396
again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways .	96.879105
our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .	41.76659
very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs to ' ' some way of thought labelled as a `` school ' ' or an `` -ism ' ' , i . e . a complex or `` syndrome ' ' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .	75.5137
thus ideas like `` grace ' ' , `` salvation ' ' , and `` providence ' ' cluster together in traditional christianity .	37.63841
usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` -ism ' ' or mode of thought .	52.94657
accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley ' s poems or the type of stoicism present in henley ' s `` invictus ' ' , and we may find that describing such platonism or such stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise .	72.80521
after all , shelley is no `` orthodox ' ' or hellenic platonist , and even his `` romantic ' ' platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries .	32.963947
again , henley ' s attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like marcus aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost christian , comparable to the patience expressed in milton ' s sonnet on his own blindness .	95.11245
in recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences .	63.862907
when these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even , to some extent , with science .	117.874596
here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian ' s research .	43.154522
let us quote once more from r . g . collingwood `` history is properly concerned with the actions of human beings regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world	99.68113
regarded from the inside , it is the carrying into action of a certain thought the historian ' s business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them .	118.93213
it is a characteristic of thoughts that in re-thinking them we come , ipso facto , to understand why they were thought ' ' .	74.80742
such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition .	21.581999
`` history has this in common with every other science that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .	99.59951
this is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential .	154.07005
the knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events ' ' .	68.10449
it is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research .	173.48062
the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at the same time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another .	89.62998
let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought -- turning our attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades .	149.41522
we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .	119.28796
finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .	127.87043
no one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them .	69.27297
still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .	132.18336
the actual moments of contact are vitally important .	5.7624025
these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned .	51.361225
perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world has been that of the old and new testament .	39.2008
certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the bible .	69.151054
this reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence .	360.00775
a contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , st . augustine , john bunyan , and thomas jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression .	77.41701
in much the same way , we recognize the importance of shakespeare ' s familarity with plutarch and montaigne , of shelley ' s study of plato ' s dialogues , and of coleridge ' s enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from plato to schelling and william godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of english men of letters .	42.199
we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .	60.426807
english philosopher samuel alexander ' s debt to wordsworth and meredith is a recent interesting example , as also a . n . whitehead ' s understanding of the english romantics , chiefly shelley and wordsworth .	61.92997
hegel ' s profound admiration for the insights of the greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy .	52.495373
again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius , who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles .	104.023224
we must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units ' ' in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for that matter , from one individual to another .	96.36328
`` suppose you take mr . hearst ' s morning american at $10 , 000 a year ' ' , brisbane proposed .	53.476273
`` you could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors .	109.44254
if within one year you can make a success out of the american , you can practically name your own salary thereafter .	173.37303
of course , if you don ' t make the american a success , hearst will have no further use for you ' ' .	76.102005
the blue-eyed watson decided that he would dislike living in new york , and the deal fell through .	131.45236
hearst ' s luck was even poorer when he had a chat with franklin k . lane , a prominent california journalist and reform politician , whom he asked for his support .	56.15923
lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of california in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of hearst ' s san francisco examiner .	64.603355
hearst disclaimed blame for this , but the conversation , according to lane , ended on a tart note .	112.51337
`` mr . lane ' ' , hearst said , `` if you ever wish anything that i can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done ' ' .	30.057255
`` mr . hearst ' ' , lane replied as he left , `` if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put the telegram down as a forgery ' ' .	38.788403
hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to new york to become a father .	34.26454
on april 10 , 1904 , his first child was born , a son named george after the late senator .	69.53501
hearst saw his wife and child , sent a joyful message to his mother in california , and soon returned to washington , where on april 22 , for the first time , he opened his mouth in congress .	37.470028
this was not before the house but before the judiciary committee , where he asked for action on one of his pet bills , that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly .	83.51676
attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united states attorney for the southern district of new york .	64.03514
hearst had spent more than $60 , 000 of his own money in the probe , but still attorney general knox was quiescent .	89.616005
six of the railroads carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields , hearst said , not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines .	169.36024
they had watered their stock at immense profit , then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton , netting themselves another $20 , 000 , 000 in annual profit .	51.610954
`` the attorney general has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months ' ' , hearst said .	56.195316
`` he has not acted in any way , and won ' t let anyone take it away from him .	38.45365
what i want is to have this evidence come before congress and if the attorney general does not report it , as i am very sure he won ' t , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , i then wish that a committee of seven representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence .	71.538376
this was the very sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind .	116.39616
there can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington , overt or implied , to block anything hearst wanted , even if it was something good .	111.907364
roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley .	44.04779
they were repelled by his noisy newspapers , his personal publicity , his presumptuous campaign for the presidential nomination , and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses .	47.255672
he might get votes from his constituents , but he would never get a helping hand in congress .	55.33126
inherently incapable of cooperating with others , he ran his own show regardless of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on .	230.52122
he was a political maverick , a reformer with his own program , determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him .	44.11715
he showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats .	44.255733
he sought to run congress as he ran his new york american or journal , a scheme veteran legislators resisted .	129.5644
for a freshman congressman to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends .	159.19287
he soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the house , and came to be regarded with detestation by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline .	72.41779
to old-line democrats , the hearst presidential boom , now in full cry , was the joke of the new century .	51.074703
yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t . r . a semblance of a race .	79.307976
there was talk of dragging old ex-president cleveland out of retirement for another try .	126.05479
some preferred judge alton b . parker of new york .	24.03826
the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country .	25.224743
platoons of hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention , and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading .	99.10543
just when it was needed for the campaign , hearst paper no . 8 , the boston american , began publication .	246.40738
a bay state supporter said , `` mr . hearst ' s fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in boston ' ' .	41.488953
he ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain from using such words as `` seduction ' ' , `` rape ' ' , `` abortion ' ' , `` criminal assault ' ' and `` born out of wedlock ' ' .	28.273767
in a story headed , `` hearst offers cash ' ' , the republican new york tribune spread the money rumor , quoting an unnamed `` hearst supporter ' ' as saying	64.28337
`` the argument that is cutting most ice is that hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt them if he were elected .	97.45758
the hearst men say that if hearst is nominated , he and his immediate friends will contribute to the democratic national committee the sum of $1 , 500 , 000 .	39.71133
this , it is urged , would relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the trust magnates .	62.177513
the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a democratic victory absolutely fruitless .	101.75079
the average democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office .	105.00118
it has been a long time since he has seen any campaign money , and when the proposition is laid down to him as the friends of mr . hearst are laying it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard the hearst bandwagon ' ' .	68.22388
if anything , the conservative democrats were more opposed to hearst than the republicans .	128.50919
in his own state of new york , the two democratic bellwethers , state leader hill and tammany boss murphy , were saying nothing openly against hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites , murphy being for cleveland and hill for parker .	194.92883
they had lost twice with the radical bryan , and were having no part of hearst , whom they considered more radical than bryan .	113.5379
but his increasing strength in the west looked menacing .	3.4432247
it caused henry watterson to sound a blast in his louisville courier-journal	21.001373
`` does any sane democrat believe that mr . hearst , a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues , without a word or act in the public life of his country , past or present , that can be shown to be his to commend him , could by any possibility be elected president of the united states ? ?	82.40149
more splenetic was senator edward carmack of tennessee , a parker man .	138.72528
`` the nomination of hearst would compass the ruin of the party ' ' , carmack said .	22.890945
`` it would be a disgrace , and , as i have already said to the people of tennessee , if hearst is nominated , we may as well pen a dispatch , and send it back from the field of battle ' all is lost , including our honor ' ' ' .	93.19017
a lone pro-hearst voice from new york city was that of william devery , who had been expelled as a tammany leader but still claimed strong influence in his own district .	66.97226
`` i understand [ hearst ] is a candidate for presidential honors ' ' , devery said without cracking a smile .	85.11876
`` there ' s nothing like buildin ' from the bottom up .	199.37329
if he ' s going to the st . louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it .	62.172707
he ' s got a lot of friends , and he ought to come along and let us know if he wants our help ' ' .	31.86484
hearst won the iowa state convention , but ran into a bitter battle in indiana before losing to parker , drawing an angry statement from indiana ' s john w . kern	108.99513
`` we are menaced for the first time in the history of the republic by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase the presidential nomination .	38.90501
our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers .	56.00819
as for the paid hessians from other states , we are here to instruct the indiana democracy in their duty , i have nothing but contempt .	91.246414
the hearst dollar mark is all over them .	3.7242844
the talk of a hearst `` barrel ' ' was increasing .	73.02543
another indiana observer later commented , `` perhaps we shall never know how much was spent ( by hearst ) , but if as much money was expended elsewhere as in indiana a liberal fortune was squandered ' ' .	119.49535
in his fight for the illinois and indiana delegations , hearst made several trips to chicago to confer with andrew lawrence , the former san francisco examiner man who was now his chicago kingpin , and once to meet with bryan .	71.91261
on one visit he stopped at the office of the american , where he was known surreptitiously as `` the great white chief ' ' , and for the first time met his managing editor , fat moses koenigsberg .	45.99296
koenigsberg never did learn what hearst wanted , for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door .	80.887535
`` never mind , thank you ' ' , he said .	4.7204876
`` i must hurry to catch my train ' ' .	2.8197894
another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle of letters that had accumulated for him , saying , `` but mr . hearst , what shall i do with this correspondence ' ' ? ?	37.554302
`` i ' ll show you ' ' , hearst replied , grinning .	40.718876
he took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket .	52.92706
every letter answers itself in a couple of weeks ' ' .	13.602204
hearst hopped into a private railroad car with max ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states , always wearing a frock coat , listening intently to local politicians , and generally making a good impression .	52.08781
he laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated .	32.560818
`` i should , of course ' ' , he said , `` like any other man , be honored and gratified should the democrats see fit to nominate me .	79.904045
but i do not have to be bribed by office to be a democrat .	47.552452
i have supported the democratic party in the last five campaigns .	159.63809
i supported cleveland three times and bryan twice .	11.720425
i intend to support the nominee of the party at st . louis , whoever he may be ' ' .	26.995695
the hearst press followed the chief ' s progress at the various state conventions with its usual admiring attention , stressing the `` enthusiasm ' ' and `` loyalty ' ' he inspired .	55.016296
this was historic in its way , for it marked the first time an american presidential aspirant had advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land .	68.65965
yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value .	137.16682
when nan patterson , a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who had appeared in a floradora road show , rode down broadway in a hansom cab with her married lover , frank young , she stopped the cab to disclose that young had been shot dead , tearfully insisting that he had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so .	101.75361
trevelyan ' s liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit , a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty .	100.42414
his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of garibaldi ' s exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the events described .	54.793133
the three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of trevelyan ' s prose which remained conspicuous through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority .	131.10187
the confused rambling of guerrilla warfare , such as most of garibaldi ' s campaigns were , was brought to life by trevelyan ' s pen in some of the best passages in the books .	39.999447
his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities .	165.8037
military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients .	227.66777
but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story .	75.25033
trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject .	58.663784
the outstanding example was in garibaldi and the thousand , where he made use of unpublished papers of lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the straits of messina .	84.397865
in looking back over the volumes , it is possible to find errors of interpretation , some of which were not so evident at the time of writing .	31.829754
thus trevelyan repeats the story which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto at the insistence of general radetzky .	27.221355
later research has shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false .	123.7355
trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and french policy , and he is more than generous in assessing british policy .	91.55642
but fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of italy , a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication .	51.614487
trevelyan ' s manin and the venetian revolution of 1848 , his last major volume on an italian theme , was written in a minor key .	95.3424
published in 1923 , it did not gain the popular acclaim of the garibaldi volumes , probably because trevelyan felt less at home with manin , the bourgeois lawyer , than with garibaldi , the filibuster .	112.4637
the complexities of venetian politics eluded him , but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures , with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of the part played by its leading figure .	87.527824
if it is not one of his best books , it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his own garibaldi .	91.72995
already trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english figures of the same period .	139.66074
first the life of john bright appeared and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill .	208.58405
of the two , the life of bright is incomparably the better biography .	82.017006
trevelyan centers too exclusively on bright , is insufficiently appreciative of the views of bright ' s opponents and critics , and makes light of the genuine difficulties faced by peel .	89.89475
yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man , his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength .	36.583286
in the story of bright and the corn law agitation , the crimean war , the american civil war , and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long .	91.071365
because bright ' s speeches were so much a part of him , there are long and numerous quotations , which , far from making the biography diffuse , help to give us the feel of the man .	62.95657
associated in a sense with the manchester school through his mother ' s family , trevelyan conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive .	94.428276
nineteenth-century virtues , however , seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular .	103.09438
the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all .	62.12242
it is a whig history of the `` tory reaction ' ' which preceded the reform bill of 1832 , and it uses the figure of grey to give some unity to the narrative .	90.58629
the volume is a piece of passionate special pleading , written with the heat -- and often with the wisdom , it must be said -- of a liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832 .	75.593285
the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of discontent and repression was , he has told us , congenial to his artistic sense .	64.989655
and grey ' s northumberland background was close to trevelyan ' s own .	13.534913
but his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation .	75.48486
some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the tory tradition appear `` contemptible rather than intelligible ' ' , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the `` intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which , at times , politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents ' ' .	67.71887
the liberal-radical heritage which informs all of trevelyan ' s interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues and oversimplified the period .	84.13271
research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to a more ambitious work .	96.47266
britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook designed `` to give the sense of continuous growth , to show how economic led to social , and social to political change , how the political events reacted on the economic and social , and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process ' ' .	122.47023
the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832 .	104.11553
more temperately than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias , trevelyan vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days , portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors , and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus .	152.3985
by what one reader called a `` series of dissolving views ' ' , he merges one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth .	54.675186
but after 1832 , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics , often unconnected by any single thread .	59.023643
economic analysis was never trevelyan ' s strong point and the england of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis .	146.63689
yet after 1832 , the interrelations of economic and social and political affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional political account .	74.78887
finally , the period after 1870 receives little attention and that quite superficial .	65.23205
yet britain in the nineteenth century became the vade mecum of beginning students of history , went through edition after edition , and continues to be reprinted up to the very present .	150.55894
its success is a tribute , above all , to trevelyan ' s brilliance as a literary stylist .	33.90361
in 1924 trevelyan traveled to the united states , where he delivered the lowell lectures at harvard university .	33.826412
these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of english development which took form afterward as a history of england .	113.04824
in short order , the general history became his most popular work and has remained , aside from his later social history , the work most widely favored by the public .	143.179
the history of england has often been compared with green ' s short history .	172.47238
like green , trevelyan aimed to write a history not of `` english kings or english conquests ' ' , but of the english people .	66.602936
the history takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than english schoolboys , and like britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes beyond 1870 .	67.64039
trevelyan ' s excursions into contemporary history were rarely happy ones .	892.95404
but as a stimulating , provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable .	73.8315
living pictures of the early boroughs , country life in tudor and stuart times , the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature , the common law , parliamentary development .	88.576126
the strength of the history is also its weakness .	45.162903
trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and character over those of other peoples .	251.25305
his nationalism was not a new characteristic , but its self-consciousness , even its self-satisfaction , is more obvious in a book that stretches over the long reach of english history .	50.425243
and yet the elements which capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the english story worth telling and worth remembering .	157.33733
tolerance and compromise , social justice and civil liberty , are today too often in short supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan ' s emphasis on their central place in the english tradition .	111.12749
like most major works of synthesis , the history of england is informed by the positive views of a first-class mind , and this is surely a major work .	43.59806
four years after the publication of the history of england , the first volume of trevelyan ' s queen anne trilogy appeared .	21.003487
by now he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge and had been honored by the award of the order of merit .	52.360676
his academic duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen .	68.01657
blenheim was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession , the three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne .	67.16491
like his volume on wycliffe , the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents , in this case illustrative of the history of queen anne ' s reign down to 1707 .	42.116673
trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where macaulay ' s history of england had broken off .	76.52755
in addition , he believed in the `` dramatic unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 , lying between the stuart and hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own ' ' .	39.805847
he saw the age as one in which britain `` settled her free constitution ' ' and attained her modern place in the world .	122.152374
to most observers , there is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon the years of anne ' s reign which in reality existed only in the pages of his history .	93.34124
of the three volumes , blenheim is easily the best .	64.46549
in four opening chapters reminiscent of macaulay ' s famous third chapter , trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening of the eighteenth century .	31.219172
his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life .	170.91946
he tends to underestimate -- or perhaps to view charitably -- the brutality and the violence of the age , so that there is an idyllic quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality .	73.8209
yet as an evocation of time past , there are few such successful portraits in english historical literature .	67.51945
once the scene is set , trevelyan skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim .	46.781643
the account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of garibaldi ' s campaigns , trevelyan ' s outstanding military narrative .	39.33792
the scene is etched in sharp detail , the military problems brilliantly explained , and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident .	148.7119
if only for this modest masterpiece of military history , blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars .	103.57337
ramillies and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity .	129.95212
yet in several chapters on scotland in the eighteenth century , trevelyan copes persuasively with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background of scottish religion , customs , and traditions .	38.27764
i stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces .	34.6204
questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities .	114.52447
after making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the rhine into germany .	45.34171
`` may we come with you ' ' ? ?	2.9851756
`` well , i might not get that far ' ' , i told them , `` as actually i have no papers to enter germany and , as a matter of fact , no permit to return to france once i leave ' ' .	44.902786
we would all meet at ten o ' clock at the kehl bridge , five miles from strasbourg , and march triumphantly across into germany .	29.912302
there was only one hitch the small town of kehl , on the other side of the rhine , was still under french jurisdiction .	25.054892
the real franco-german frontier was beyond the town ' s limits .	21.04906
in fact , all persons were permitted to cross the rhine into kehl , there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river .	28.624939
that evening , as i learned later , the students , enjoying that spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students , surged out onto the streets of strasbourg , overturning empty streetcars , marking up store fronts , and shouting imprudently , `` garry davis to power ' ' ! !	82.85917
as i got off the trolley at kehl bridge the next morning , i was met by what looked like 5 , 000 students , some of whom were carrying sticks apparently for the coming `` battle ' ' with the police .	70.48687
alarmed by this display of weapons , i looked toward the bridge and there saw , stretched across the near side , a cordon of policemen , their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several french officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby .	107.36479
`` listen please ' ' , i called to the students in french .	63.633713
`` i thank you most heartily for being here .	103.52562
this is full evidence of your support for my principles .	74.77657
these principles , however , will not be served by violence in any form .	62.333515
if they are right , they will prevail of and by themselves .	191.07089
i ask you all to support me in this .	43.587368
if one finger is raised against the authorities , all our moral power will vanish .	203.79408
your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what i am saying .	47.284695
i marched up to the waiting officials , the students massed behind me .	182.56323
as usual , the press photographers were on hand .	25.672857
the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade , and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france .	58.054253
i replied in the affirmative , taking out my recently acquired titre d ' identite et de voyage , on which was stamped a permission to leave france .	62.194324
he examined it carefully , handed it back and said , `` eh bien , you may leave france ' ' .	25.407885
one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way , demanding to know whether i had permission to enter germany .	50.036873
`` no , i have no permission to enter germany ' ' , i told him .	9.388145
`` alors , you may go no farther ' ' , he said imperiously .	12.457937
`` is this then the frontier ' ' ? ?	8.6561365
at this , the students let out a yell , knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of kehl .	153.74495
`` but i have no permission to re-enter france , and i have just left ' ' , i told him .	14.190469
`` i must then be standing on the line between france and germany ' ' .	19.405376
but there is no line between france and germany , that is , no actual line .	127.259476
`` but if there is no line , how can there be two countries ? ?	68.059006
you have just given me permission to leave france , which i did .	46.74105
and as you know , i have no permission to re-enter france once out .	22.311762
obviously i ' m stuck on the line between the two countries ' ' .	10.189885
the students were laughing uproariously at this piece of logic , and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile .	104.8019
`` mais non ' ' , the interior ministry man coaxed , `` you may come back to strasbourg , now , if you wish ' ' .	24.377258
then will you give me a visa to re-enter france ' ' ? ?	3.655794
but there is no question of a visa .	15.198795
`` ah , then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here ' ' -- i indicated the french occupation officer -- `` informs me that germany is just on the other side of him ' ' .	70.472115
the interior man looked uneasily at his french compatriot .	2.0013382
from the crowd were coming cries of `` he ' s right ' ' ! !	14.009477
`` there must be a line ' ' ! !	7.7893114
and `` bravo , garry , continue ' ' ! !	4.058125
seeing their hesitation , i said , `` well , until i have permission to enter germany , or a visa to re-enter france , i shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries ' ' , whereupon i moved to the side of the road , parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my typewriter , and began typing the above conversation .	50.867176
the reporters were questioning the interior man and the french officer , both of whom remained noncommittal as to what action , if any , would be taken in my regard .	71.83238
finally they went off to file their stories , after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil .	67.03849
the students crowded around asking questions , slapping me on the back , and generally being friendly .	74.83243
`` but what will you do this evening , mr . davis ' ' ? ?	10.881955
`` it will be very cold ' ' .	1.9521334
`` i don ' t know ' ' , i told him , `` except that i will be here ' ' .	12.494068
`` i shall see about getting you a tent ' ' , he said .	9.654157
`` i have a small sports shop in strasbourg ' ' .	13.9886465
that would be a great help , i told him , thanking him for his thoughtfulness .	38.805126
a special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure i didn ' t cross , the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men , women , and children , dogs , cats , horses , cars , trucks , baby carriages -- could cross kehl bridge into kehl without surveillance .	52.08432
the day passed eventfully enough , with a constant stream of visitors , some stopping only to say hello , others getting into serious conversations , such as one andre fuchs , a free-lance journalist from strasbourg who wrote an article for the nouvelle alsatian in highly sympathetic terms .	112.22735
some students from the university returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week .	139.78012
a volunteer food brigade had been arranged , they told me , which would supply me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge .	83.40823
a little later , the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent .	24.668915
one of the girl students , sitting by while i ate the thick soup , asked me if i had a sleeping bag .	93.10955
when i informed her that i didn ' t , she said she would borrow her brother ' s and bring it to me later that evening .	57.449493
`` you do not know me ' ' , she said in good english , `` but my mother was your governess in philadelphia when you were a child ' ' .	32.748154
i was delighted to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances .	186.27238
the peter family proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days , mrs . peter , little esther , and raoul , who generously lent me his sleeping bag for my `` watch on the rhine ' ' .	36.608624
sighting a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side , i pitched the tent that evening on the stateless `` line ' ' , digging a small trench around it as best i could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child .	100.55596
the wind from the rhine was damp and chill , necessitating a fire for warmth .	30.342577
after scouring around a bit in the open area , i came across what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly , giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky .	108.37861
each evening the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits pains , esther usually being among them .	83.618454
i had advised friends to write me to `` no man ' s land , pont kehl , between strasbourg and kehl , france-germany ' ' .	34.364353
sure enough , mail began trickling in , delivered by a talkative , highly amused french postman who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized .	63.761433
on christmas eve , students brought out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the tent .	68.18362
as the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural playground for the kids of the neighborhood , i had made many friends among them , taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately to translate grimm ' s fairy tales into an understandable french as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent .	78.015305
to my great surprise and delight , when they saw the two trees they went rushing off , returning shortly with decorations from their own trees .	161.35306
it was a merry if somewhat soggy christmas for me that year .	58.446754
in the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of cologne , heidelberg , and baden-baden .	23.09721
twenty thousand world citizens at stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town .	86.30868
when dr . adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find out his disposition of my case , he gave them his personal approval of my entry , saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into germany .	77.367
the special guard , however , was still posted on kehl bridge .	110.927055
as it began raining at around eight o ' clock on december 26th , i retired into my tent early , somewhat tired and discouraged , my body reacting sluggishly because of the continued exposure .	84.4287
no matter how large the fire , i couldn ' t seem to shake off the chill that day .	27.989923
`` oh , mr . davis , are you there ' ' ? ?	12.52867
a voice drifted in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after i had fallen into a fitful sleep .	68.59807
`` we ' re from the council of europe , british delegation .	94.696754
may we have a word with you ' ' ? ?	2.358828
i ' ve had a trying day and i just can ' t make it out again ' ' , i told them .	20.071531
later i learned that sir hugh dalton had expressed a desire to see me , hence their trip to `` no man ' s land ' ' .	45.962116
on the evening of december 27th , esther noticed my pallid look and rasping voice .	85.10415
she entreated me to see a doctor , and when i refused , brought one out to see me .	87.687485
i wouldn ' t hear of it because it meant giving up the `` line ' ' , though i realized i was in poor shape physically .	106.10303
esther , mistaking my hesitation , assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in strasbourg whom she had already approached .	129.21095
`` no , it ' s not that ' ' , i told her .	15.323722
`` you see , once i relinquish the position i ' ve already established here , i couldn ' t regain it without sacrificing the logic of it ' ' .	36.1592
at that moment , up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from basel , switzerland .	105.07476
without preliminaries , esther asked him , `` if you are a world citizen , will you take garry davis ' place in his tent while he goes to the hospital ' ' ? ?	38.236916
`` but of course , with pleasure ' ' , he replied .	6.960523
`` what is your name ' ' ? ?	1.014486
`` you have just enlisted for the ' rhine campaign ' ' ' .	32.646748
esther jumped up , ran to him and gave him a little hug .	38.292236
now come , garry , we must go quickly .	106.43915
such were the incongruities of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me were drafted into driving me to the strasbourg hospital while world citizen jean babel waved adieu from the `` line ' ' ! !	94.35991
he remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy .	50.86026
when the victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted , with his horse pressed broadside against cleburne ' s log parapet in a tangled group of infantrymen .	69.518364
his hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes .	25.485466
six climactic minutes in an individual ' s life left no memory .	324.31244
eight hundred and sixty-five rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day .	187.14648
seven battle flags and fourteen officers ' swords were sent to thomas ' headquarters .	35.970882
it was the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign .	79.457954
the fourteenth regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes , among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment .	157.1848
the thirty-eighth regiment of ohio volunteers , one of the regiments in thomas ' first division during buell ' s command , suffered its greatest loss of the war in this action .	60.30539
a popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up stanley for this assault .	88.106316
sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall seeing thomas ride so fast .	68.41934
while thomas ' injured back led him to restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough when he had to .	205.2221
it is not in the record , but he must have galloped his horse at peach tree creek when he brought up ward ' s guns to save newton ' s crumbling line .	55.21182
while the final combat of the campaign was being worked out at jonesborough , thomas , on sherman ' s instructions , ordered slocum , now commanding the twentieth corps , to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without exposing his bridgehead to a counterattack .	104.37544
the dispatch must have been sent after sundown on september 1 .	22.557518
slocum made his reconnaissanace the next morning , found the town empty , accepted the surrender of the mayor and occupied the city a little before noon .	131.09113
on the morning of september 2 the fourth corps and the armies of the tennessee and the ohio followed the line of hardee ' s retreat .	37.405315
about noon they came up with the enemy two miles from lovejoy ' s station and deployed .	52.42097
the fourth corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line .	84.323166
that night a note written in slocum ' s hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta .	107.64125
before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note to thomas .	95.16789
in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed on his heels .	81.06469
the cautious thomas re-examined the note and then , making up his mind that it was genuine , snapped his fingers , whistled and almost danced in his exuberance .	46.370304
the next day sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta .	71.64475
the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice .	19.610146
hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors .	45.249428
by both standards thomas had the right to be proud .	52.29215
thomas thanked his men for their tenacity of purpose , unmurmuring endurance , cheerful obedience , brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle .	76.05097
sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the larger fruits of victory .	108.493095
he supposed the military world would approve of his accomplishment .	45.554817
whatever the military world thought , the political world approved it wholeheartedly .	288.52744
for some time , despondency in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways -- an eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with lincoln .	88.36229
proposals were in the air for a year ' s armistice .	22.585575
lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected .	93.24013
in the midst of this gloom , at 10 05 p . m . on september 2 , slocum ' s telegram to stanton , `` general sherman has taken atlanta ' ' , shattered the talk of a negotiated peace and boosted lincoln into the white house .	54.12541
to the republicans no victory could have been more complete .	262.11298
official congratulations showered upon sherman and his army .	3.4220629
lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability , courage and perseverance .	27.465445
he felt that this campaign would be famous in the annals of war .	34.19016
grant called it prompt , skillful and brilliant .	28.557909
halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war .	17.77985
actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure .	4.2230973
next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action .	41.753983
sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from lovejoy ' s to atlanta .	66.52945
but , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful .	57.05691
within the narrow frame of military tactics , too , the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant .	80.153694
in seventeen weeks the military front was driven southward more than 100 miles .	63.426716
there was a battle on an average of once every three weeks .	113.53357
in the summary of the principal events of the campaign compiled from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting .	147.79466
the casualties in the army of the cumberland were 22 , 807 , while for all three armies they were 37 , 081 .	122.14526
men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep .	55.97658
rifle fire often kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces .	130.99196
modern warfare was born in this campaign -- periscopes , camouflage , booby traps , land mines , extended order , trench raids , foxholes , armored cars , night attacks , flares , sharpshooters in trees , interlaced vines and treetops , which were the forerunners of barbed wire , trip wires to thwart a cavalry charge , which presaged the mine trap , and the general use of anesthetics .	58.873795
the use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers began to select tactical points by designating a spot as `` near the letter o in the word mountain ' ' .	144.97255
a few weeks later the maps were being divided into squares and a position was described as being `` about lots 239 , 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196 ' ' .	69.612175
this system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them from a mobile lithograph press .	90.594925
orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement .	111.78688
sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks .	49.971565
to the rebels it seemed as if sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets .	78.178856
the whistle of sherman ' s locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish fire .	30.383707
as always , the ranks worked out new and better tactics , but there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their military thinking .	85.90498
the fossilized , formalized , precedent-based thinking of the legendary military brain was not evident in sherman ' s armies .	72.06248
sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old .	21.670187
one of sherman ' s most serious shortcomings , however , was his mistrust of his cavalry .	50.798325
he never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it .	49.6977
then , in some way , this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice .	117.25319
a horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with two pounds .	130.44002
the horseman required eleven times more than the footman .	26.053692
he would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country .	83.25545
already debilitated by the chattanooga starvation , the quality of sherman ' s horseflesh ran downhill as the campaign progressed .	39.196793
every recorded request by thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses .	81.49614
well led , properly organized cavalry , in its complementary role to infantry , had four functions .	194.3912
first , it could locate the enemy infantry , learn what they were doing , and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over .	107.514496
second , it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy .	20.179014
third , it could threaten at all times , and destroy when possible , the enemy communications .	96.15622
it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier .	119.137825
its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign .	162.36255
thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet , but his plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum mobility and with its commander stripped from it .	105.04111
sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings .	109.279274
his conception proved workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean , deft , well organized retreats with small materiel losses .	96.28846
sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways , yet garrard ' s covington raid and rousseau ' s opelika raid cut two-thirds of the rail lines he had to break and sherman lived in mortal fear of what forrest might do to his communications .	101.04739
when mcpherson pushed blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive movement , the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted infantry , totally inadequate for its role .	107.39741
it stumbled on infantry where no infantry should have been and mcpherson ' s aggressive impulse faded out , overwhelmed by fears of the unknown .	87.37837
a proper cavalry command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into one division of polk ' s army of the mississippi moving up from the direction of mobile to join johnston at dalton .	67.47121
from the night of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry east of the macon railway to disclose to sherman that he was missing the greatest opportunity of his career .	73.08437
a great part of the time , thomas ' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line .	80.714
at such times thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike him .	71.40969
it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes .	195.67682
heat during the atlanta campaign , coupled with unsuitable clothing , caused individual irritation that was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean clothing .	69.82355
to relieve the itch and sweat galls , the men got into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private truce while the men went swimming .	164.2191
johnston believed that sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various fords .	87.34008
lieutenant colonel james p . brownlow , who commanded the first brigade of thomas ' first cavalry division , was ordered across one of these fords .	75.35012
the water was deep and brownlow took his troopers across naked -- except for guns , cartridge boxes and hats .	110.99113
they kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels , drove the rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men .	69.41333
most of the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff brush than their naked pursuers .	120.37728
rank was becoming an explosive issue in all three of sherman ' s armies .	27.85167
merited recommendations from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees from civil life .	137.68242
in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of meynell , thompson told patmore of his distress at having had to leave london before this new friendship had developed further ``	160.24425
that was a very absurd and annoying situation in which i was placed by w . m . ' s curious methods of handling me .	48.444614
he never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was to leave for lymington .	73.52515
the result was that i found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week , only two days before my departure from london .	92.89628
luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not i ' ' .	70.85529
it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements , which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant .	177.53609
when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included fervent verses from pantasaph , mrs . king felt a proper victorian alarm .	120.6617
some , she knew , looked upon thompson almost as a saint , but others read in `` the hound of heaven ' ' what they took to be the confessions of a great sinner , who , like oscar wilde , had -- as one pious writer later put it -- thrown himself `` on the swelling wave of every passion ' ' .	89.08964
consequently , on october 31 , 1896 , mrs . king wrote to thompson , quite against her daughter ' s wishes , asking him not to `` recommence a correspondence which i believe has been dropped for some weeks ' ' .	61.69265
katherine was staying at a convent , and her mother felt that , as thompson himself seems to have suggested , she might eventually stay there .	109.35996
this prospect did not please mrs . king any more than did the possibility that her daughter might marry a bohemian , but she used it to suggest to thompson that , `` it is not in her nature to love you ' ' .	61.2416
for his part , thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between katie and himself .	54.14604
at no time does he seem to have proposed marriage , and mrs . king was evidently torn between a concern for her daughter ' s emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation .	83.41989
in any case , she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see katie again , `` now that this frank explanation has been made & no one can misunderstand ' ' .	92.26438
she ended her letter with the assurance that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an honor , from which she could not part `` without still more pain ' ' .	77.04862
after thompson came to london to live , he received a letter from katie , which was dated february 8 , 1897 .	26.326204
she regretted what she described as the `` unwarrantable & unnecessary ' ' check to their friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another perfectly .	107.23724
i am a great deal at the little children ' s hospital .	76.634796
i know you are very busy now , you are writing a great deal & your book is coming out , isn ' t it ? ?	76.18265
but if you are able & care to come , you know how glad i shall be .	108.07939
katherine douglas king ' ' the invitation was accepted and other letters followed , in which she spoke of her concern for his health and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled children she served .	134.6391
it is difficult to say what thompson expected would come of their relationship , which had begun so soon after his emotions had been stirred by maggie brien , but when katie wrote on april 11 , 1900 , to tell him that she was to be married to the rev . godfrey burr , the vicar of rushall in staffordshire , the news evidently helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse .	49.703045
in a letter to meynell , which was written in june , less than a month before katie ' s wedding , he was highly melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets ``	67.98775
a week in arrears , and without means to pay , i must go , it is the only right thing .	68.91418
perhaps mrs . meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book , with all its mementos of her and the dear ones .	45.10397
last , not least , there are some poems which k . king sent me ( addressed to herself ) when i was preparing a fresh volume , asking me to include them .	96.20273
the terrible blow of the new year put an end to that project .	84.56823
i wish you would return them to her .	10.886058
i never had the courage to look at them , when my projected volume became hopeless , fearing they were poor , until now when i was obliged to do so .	85.290695
o my genius , young and ripening , you would swear , -- when i wrote them	159.95546
all chance of fulfilling my destiny is over .	23.58991
i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems , dear father-brother , now i am gone	152.71967
and launch them on the world when their time comes .	74.45134
for them a box will be lodgment enough .	2.8683076
since my silence must have ended when i gave the purposed volume to you .	158.39601
i ask you to do me the last favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening , about which time i shall come to say my sad good-bye .	129.99103
if you don ' t think much of them , tell me the wholesome truth .	93.548164
if otherwise , you will give me a pleasure .	135.50047
but this -- yes , terrible step i am about to take is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found hope that here , in these poems , is treasure -- or at least some measure of beauty , which i did not know of ' ' .	63.219456
thompson , of course , was persuaded not to take the `` terrible step ' '	28.599405
meynell once again paid his debts and it was katie , rather than thompson , whose life was soon ended , for she died in childbirth in april , 1901 , in the first year of her marriage .	69.978195
the `` orphaned poems ' ' mentioned in the letter to meynell comprised a group of five sonnets , which were published in the 1913 edition of thompson ' s works under the heading `` ad amicam ' ' , plus certain other completed pieces and rough drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books .	65.23715
the publication of father connolly ' s the man has wings has made more of the group available in print so that a general picture of what it contained can now be had without difficulty .	173.92592
some of the poems express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love	400.9512
