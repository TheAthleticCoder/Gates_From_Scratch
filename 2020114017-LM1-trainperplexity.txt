the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta ' s recent primary election produced `` no evidence ' ' that any irregularities took place .	1024.7805
the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta ' ' for the manner in which the election was conducted .	417.58563
the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities ' ' in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr . .	1704.2018
`` only a relative handful of such reports was received ' ' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city ' ' .	143.38506
the jury said it did find that many of georgia ' s registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ' ' .	369.7022
it recommended that fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ' ' .	512.6308
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ' ' .	557.9965
however , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ' ' .	260.52936
the city purchasing department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ' ' .	310.2755
it urged that the city `` take steps to remedy ' ' this problem .	505.10257
implementation of georgia ' s automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .	691.3698
it urged that the next legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ' ' .	847.43304
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department ' s handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .	1285.9656
`` this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program ' ' , the jury said , but the state welfare department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county , which receives none of this money .	267.80423
the jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ' ' .	680.7066
nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds ' ' , the jurors said .	294.18658
`` failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden ' ' on fulton taxpayers .	470.55463
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary ' s court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .	530.12573
the jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations ' ' of two previous grand juries , the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee .	855.26666
`` these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court ' s wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms ' ' , the jury said .	490.74036
regarding atlanta ' s new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge jan . 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences ' ' .	466.84933
the jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ' ' .	237.08678
on other matters , the jury recommended that ( 1 )	173.22693
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail ' ' .	878.07947
fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable ' ' pension plan for city employes .	642.43726
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department , the fulton tax commissioner ' s office , the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms , grady hospital and the fulton health department .	1026.1444
mayor william b . hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , pearl williams hartsfield , in fulton superior court friday .	2126.9414
the couple was married aug . 2 , 1913 .	127.69354
they have a son , william berry jr . , and a daughter , mrs . j . m . cheshire of griffin .	285.20895
attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon .	1443.3969
the petition listed the mayor ' s occupation as `` attorney ' ' and his age as 71 .	192.16835
it listed his wife ' s age as 74 and place of birth as opelika , ala . .	245.35556
the petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year .	270.71603
the hartsfield home is at 637 e . pelham rd . aj .	1937.4575
henry l . bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor ' s attorney .	134.58403
hartsfield has been mayor of atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 .	563.3053
his political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 .	565.9211
the mayor ' s present term of office expires jan . 1 .	1150.6901
he will be succeeded by ivan allen jr . , who became a candidate in the sept . 13 primary after mayor hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection .	687.11566
georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor ' s race , a top official said wednesday .	543.79175
robert snodgrass , state gop chairman , said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .	1041.9608
state party chairman james w . dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept . 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen . john tower will be the featured speaker .	1264.7811
in the blue ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .	856.7284
despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to republicans who attended .	293.17575
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents .	359.12033
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken 1	411.0773
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2	566.4938
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform .	847.35504
sam caldwell , state highway department public relations director , resigned tuesday to work for lt . gov . garland byrd ' s campaign .	799.03516
caldwell ' s resignation had been expected for some time .	134.42805
he will be succeeded by rob ledford of gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .	920.183
when the gubernatorial campaign starts , caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for byrd .	1614.1716
the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly .	980.017
before adjournment monday afternoon , the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made .	330.91003
gov . vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment .	627.2868
vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item .	1168.2258
meanwhile , it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds .	941.0819
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia ' s most heavily traveled highways .	464.726
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work .	1082.3757
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities .	576.92334
vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov . marvin griffin .	767.72327
the highway department source told the constitution , however , that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .	559.70575
schley county rep . b . d . pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the body ' s action of friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances .	447.73898
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie ' ' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .	547.96265
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 87-31 .	1897.1863
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 29-5 .	348.73984
as of sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action .	280.22556
pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions .	1581.3203
a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past .	629.6215
rep . mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended ' ' as state funds .	665.45636
barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed ' ' .	280.1037
but he added that none of georgia ' s congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .	395.52145
the resolution , which barber tossed into the house hopper friday , will be formally read monday .	2268.7603
it says that `` in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds ' ' , the state board of education should be directed to `` give priority ' ' to teacher pay raises .	260.32556
-- after a long , hot controversy , miller county has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election i ever saw in this county ' ' .	383.15518
the new school superintendent is harry davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated felix bush , a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee .	821.61334
davis received 1 , 119 votes in saturday ' s election , and bush got 402 .	2255.7068
ordinary carey williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order .	632.49286
`` this was the coolest , calmest election i ever saw ' ' , colquitt policeman tom williams said .	2403.3018
`` being at the polls was just like being at church .	879.70135
i didn ' t smell a drop of liquor , and we didn ' t have a bit of trouble ' ' .	87.90203
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however .	275.14575
it was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence .	5043.1416
the former county school superintendent , george p . callan , shot himself to death march 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board .	467.06866
during the election campaign , both candidates , davis and bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls .	1142.803
ordinary williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .	798.99817
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .	479.73276
sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise .	485.8128
`` everything went real smooth ' ' , the sheriff said .	114.53446
`` there wasn ' t a bit of trouble ' ' .	38.79907
-- committee approval of gov . price daniel ' s `` abandoned property ' ' act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers .	1109.1104
daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures , in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation .	573.39233
under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .	314.5519
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it .	1655.1041
daniel termed `` extremely conservative ' ' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug . 31 .	552.3839
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since texas was a republic ' ' .	519.5133
it permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .	607.63336
the bill , which daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .	1200.6177
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , daniel declared .	426.77042
dewey lawrence , a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .	1977.1538
`` if you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy ' ' , he said .	102.77466
`` you take out of circulation many millions of dollars ' ' .	180.23233
rep . charles e . hughes of sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers ' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies ' ' .	290.134
his contention was denied by several bankers , including scott hudson of sherman , gaynor b . jones of houston , j . b . brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin .	1111.0281
cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional ' ' since , he said , it would impair contracts .	582.5525
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last monday .	382.92432
-- senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen . george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties .	629.88934
the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .	344.4985
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house .	220.48384
it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300 , 000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here .	824.4905
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas , harris , bexar , tarrant and el paso would be $451 , 500 , which would be a savings of $157 , 460 yearly after the first year ' s capital outlay of $88 , 000 was absorbed , parkhouse told the senate .	1022.94586
the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county , saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school .	1420.5706
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps . v . e . ( red ) berry and joe ratcliff .	2444.8796
while details are still to be worked out , ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berry ' s proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .	548.2086
`` we ' re getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting ' ' , said ratcliff .	1137.9368
`` but i believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also .	302.8964
i ' m willing to stake my political career on it ' ' .	217.58661
rep . berry , an ex-gambler from san antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies .	3556.1965
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later .	1104.733
the house passed finally , and sent to the senate , a bill extending the state health department ' s authority to give planning assistance to cities .	232.59769
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar .	808.3591
one validated acts of school districts .	365.54926
another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district .	2358.7131
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted .	1139.9641
without dissent , senators passed a bill by sen . a . r . schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district .	499.2236
money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site .	523.753
two tax revision bills were passed .	269.3527
one , by sen . louis crump of san saba , would aid more than 17 , 000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized .	1737.7645
instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1 , 000 fine .	370.99435
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league .	346.10648
the other bill , by sen . a . m . aikin jr . of paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds .	987.73114
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by sen . frank owen 3 , of el paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas .	568.855
marshall formby of plainview , former chairman of the texas highway commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections .	509.30594
under formby ' s plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the house , attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court .	349.19763
-- state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay .	970.45465
an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot , when texas votes on a u . s . senator .	602.7176
rep . wesley roberts of seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill .	633.34235
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb . 22 .	404.75275
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot , roberts said .	1022.368
opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn ' t give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .	377.82425
all dallas members voted with roberts , except rep . bill jones , who was absent .	583.56836
-- paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas ' big cities thursday .	5761.5415
rep . james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise , a wise county hamlet of 250 people .	1015.65234
when the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen . george parkhouse of dallas .	370.85992
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen . parkhouse .	2517.3684
the bill would increase from $5 , 000 , 000 to $15 , 000 , 000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .	239.63945
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas .	2946.9934
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway cotten ' s attack .	717.7479
the bill ' s defenders were mostly small-town legislators like j . w . buchanan of dumas , eligio ( kika ) de la garza of mission , sam f . collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs .	1341.9615
`` this is a poor boy ' s bill ' ' , said chapman .	336.54532
`` dallas and fort worth can vote bonds .	703.1201
this would help the little peanut districts ' ' .	286.81253
-- a houston teacher , now serving in the legislature , proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods ' ' .	425.25888
rep . henry c . grover , who teaches history in the houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods ' ' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate .	542.0789
a normal year ' s work in college is 30 semester hours .	414.59152
grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching .	1023.0054
the remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects .	908.9574
`` a person with a master ' s degree in physics , chemistry , math or english , yet who has not taken education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools ' ' , said grover .	299.90518
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses .	252.74342
fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as co-signers of the proposal .	2677.0542
-- the board of regents of paris junior college has named dr . clarence charles clark of hays , kan . as the school ' s new president .	1025.4669
dr . clark will succeed dr . j . r . mclemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term .	203.99396
dr . clark holds an earned doctor of education degree from the university of oklahoma .	481.3918
he also received a master of science degree from texas a & i college and a bachelor of science degree from southwestern state college , weatherford , okla . .	1127.8248
in addition , dr . clark has studied at rhode island state college and massachusetts institute of technology .	253.1342
during his college career , dr . clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman .	767.7236

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon ' ' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program .	428.06464
the report , culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load .	2028.9243
the report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and adc dependency ' ' .	458.62262
the monthly cost of adc to more than 100 , 000 recipients in the county is 4 . 4 million dollars , said c . virgil martin , president of carson pirie scott & co . , committee chairman .	552.464
`` we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence ' ' , martin said .	332.2451
the volume of adc cases will decrease , martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .	895.23206
these , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc ' ' .	611.3152
other recommendations made by the committee are	145.14761
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .	469.22797
research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy .	503.08246
several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , judge james b . parsons was told in criminal court yesterday .	1606.0303
the disclosure by charles bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .	1765.1497
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client , alan clements , 30 , a separate trial .	677.6248
bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom .	1353.8959
`` the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client ' ' , bellows told the court .	353.81406
`` some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .	1604.2294
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others ' ' .	241.14888
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ' ' ? ?	315.79932
`` yes , your honor ' ' , replied bellows .	868.5985
`` what this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case .	203.23598
there is a conflict among the defendants ' ' .	127.70414
-- president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio .	1146.5254
the president spent much of the week-end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone .	645.4426
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port , mass . , a white house spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go ' ' toward completion .	817.896
asked to elaborate , pierre salinger , white house press secretary , replied , `` i would say it ' s got to go thru several more drafts ' ' .	320.8414
salinger said the work president kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia ' s demands and proposals for the city .	671.80225
the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov . 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m . karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means ' ' .	446.8796
karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence ' ' of the 50 persons .	423.05655
he said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens ' ' .	181.43175
karns ' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases .	165.97923
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case ' ' .	117.41931
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j . wexler , special prosecutor .	1677.5775
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .	802.7728
mayer goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .	3079.314
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning .	945.7829
karns said it was a `` wrongful act ' ' for wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room ' ' .	511.65442
he said this constituted a `` very serious misuse ' ' of the criminal court processes .	260.98904
`` actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court ' ' , said karns , who is a city judge in east st . louis sitting in cook county court .	412.09174
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .	1216.486
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary ' ' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .	526.4881
the cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .	977.5191
the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns .	1607.6117
two other cases also were under advisement .	1406.224
after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them .	1811.5305
-- president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14 . 2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .	1009.7442
the president , in a special message to congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .	1185.8422
the aged care plan , similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on capitol hill .	310.88565
it was defeated in congress last year .	85.591736
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .	1068.4341
the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4 , 800 of pay per year .	229.574
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5 , 000 a year and the payroll tax to 6 . 5 per cent -- 3 . 25 per cent each .	259.22903
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .	360.73138
the payroll tax would actually rise to 7 . 5 per cent starting jan . 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .	271.29044
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1 . 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .	651.98773
both figures would go higher in later years .	475.6523
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .	944.6296
these would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .	352.06113
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1	1630.7048
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .	407.3719
full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .	951.35406
a patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula ' ' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit .	944.5665
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient .	354.7334
community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .	1032.1609
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .	1271.7401
he said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay ' ' .	317.83075
`` this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs ' ' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals .	916.8788
`` this is not a program of socialized medicine .	1162.2102
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .	1412.6519
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital ' ' .	108.89103
the plan does not cover doctor bills .	2717.4397
they would still be paid by the patient .	150.6401
apart from the aged care plan the president ' s most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .	655.9831
the president said the nation ' s 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .	904.5817
moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can ' t afford the schooling costs .	553.46014
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1 , 500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .	651.1551
the schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2 , 000 a year per student .	443.13376
in addition , the government would pay a $1 , 000 `` cost of education ' ' grant to the schools for each $1 , 500 in scholarship grants .	370.16876
officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5 . 1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .	608.85443
the president recommended federal `` matching grants ' ' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones .	963.3958
in the area of `` community health services ' ' , the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .	490.71136
he asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial ' ' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants ' ' to states to improve nursing homes .	760.32404
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .	937.33203
in the child health field , the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children ' s bureau .	203.0318
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .	577.291
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .	490.19894
he did not say by how much .	274.45755
for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .	581.1142
the president said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine .	1354.1012
the president said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them ' ' .	241.35168
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .	709.5981
legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the president ' s plan .	1229.9554
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .	1032.533
senate republican leader dirksen ( ill . ) and house republican leader charles halleck ( ind . ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .	545.8722
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .	706.90607
house speaker sam rayburn ( d . , tex . ) called the kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing ' ' , but made no prediction on its fate in the house .	228.4914
-- acting hastily under white house pressure , the senate tonight confirmed robert c . weaver as the nation ' s federal housing chief .	677.9981
only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .	249.50293
a number of scattered `` ayes ' ' and `` noes ' ' was heard .	304.7197
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .	387.59387
in the last eight years , all presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .	885.5489
the rule was enforced by demand of sen . wayne morse ( d . , ore . ) in connection with president eisenhower ' s cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedy ' s in 1961 .	186.32896
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .	1434.7971
this has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .	605.2211
in oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another ' s problems .	292.54834
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist ' ' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .	380.2853
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence .	817.944
in the case of portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .	1497.5609
the general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .	493.94586
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members ' votes , since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance .	896.37933
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive .	624.1102
even norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the nato line .	600.46655
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .	305.11328
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk ' s speeches as `` inconclusive ' ' .	417.5215
but he hastened to add that , if united states policies were not always clear , despite mr . rusk ' s analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .	452.32535
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited .	783.7605
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite mr . rusk ' s personal popularity , that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .	596.06226
the secretary of state himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .	250.22041
but where the core of nato is concerned , the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states ' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone ' ' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato ' s disposal in european waters .	477.9723
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .	501.04874
the secretary ' s greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east-west friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .	969.6877
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .	444.71432
this increase in the `` threshold ' ' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance ' s most difficult problems in the months to come .	205.57108
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .	1776.0146
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time .	1621.2644
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos .	312.36002
the united states , state department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam .	955.88574
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this .	386.5809
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated .	835.3525
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .	399.86157
the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference .	554.5052
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .	242.18437
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .	451.20004
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .	530.58215
but with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises	1001.9174
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression ? ?	1838.7397
former vice-president richard m . nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union .	542.8855
he was critical of what he feels is president kennedy ' s tendency to be too conciliatory .	215.01564
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it .	1882.1952
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders ' ' in cuba .	308.3972
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn ' t attack the kennedy administration on this score .	256.7357
his reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .	127.321075
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .	354.5396
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b . morton ( r ) of kentucky , chairman of the republican national committee , that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination .	563.08594
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard , boston university , brandeis , and massachusetts institute of technology educators .	1636.1461
this group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups ' ' .	305.45694
it recommends that the united states `` seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations	1261.3422
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds ' ' .	749.989
mr . nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation .	640.4665
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated .	592.185
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos , almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by mr . nixon and the professors .	552.312
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration .	935.49554
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements .	2882.5393
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .	2055.212
but thus far there has been no response in kind .	467.57162
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .	1694.6066
in laos , the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture .	1758.8105
again and again it asked the communists to `` freeze ' ' the military situation in laos .	136.75708
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate .	862.43463
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service ' ' and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization .	1198.4475
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos .	861.73914
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos .	338.12198
( some seato nations disagreed , however .	818.97546
there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , thailand and south viet nam .	885.08325
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos .	364.09775
the pro-western government , which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma `` neutralist ' ' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army .	364.19324
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the pro-western government to the hilt .	551.0325
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .	820.0231
one factor was the statement of senator j . w . fulbright ( d ) of arkansas , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee .	357.26202
he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal ' ' of prince souvanna .	372.47568
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states .	424.436
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation ' ' .	133.47621
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the president ' s committee on juvenile delinquency and crime , to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .	608.859
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend .	1005.43115
the president has also called upon the attorney general , the secretary of health , education and welfare , and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .	238.37474
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l . hackett , a special assistant to the attorney general , as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime .	566.025
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders .	968.7661
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age .	805.33356
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , raymond h . hawksley , the present city cd head , believes .	1032.2775
mr . hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally ' ' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .	352.5108
east providence now has no civil defense program .	225.79341
mr . hawksley , the state ' s general treasurer , has been a part-time cd director in the city for the last nine years .	193.83833
he is not interested in being named a full-time director .	540.64417
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nation ' s civil defense program , mr . hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .	265.2424
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about $3 , 500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .	653.5594
mr . hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time cd job .	267.03925
one of these men is former fire chief john a . laughlin , he said .	300.4726
along with a director , the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .	502.98126
one advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .	346.70657
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said .	489.05865
mr . hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station .	888.82074
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area .	329.45148
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , mr . hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .	169.86784
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in seekonk would be another .	435.14044
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point .	1184.0205
mr . hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .	451.87073
such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .	272.03983
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time cd director , mr . hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .	343.92105
one of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .	123.93899
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government .	702.02527
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .	641.40906
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly .	218.83229
the governor ' s move into the so-called `` blue law ' ' controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r . grant , deputy city clerk of central falls .	379.17245
a copy was released to the press .	55.19934
mr . notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july 10 and sent to the state house by miss grant .	668.82837
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .	323.4158
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review , mr . notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty . gen . j . joseph nugent to get `` the benefit of his views ' ' .	268.46613
he will then appoint the study committee with mr . nugent ' s cooperation , the governor said .	136.20554
`` i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings ' ' , mr . notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws ' ' .	238.4921
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales ' ' .	392.27344
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .	459.47412
should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .	312.92264
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws .	473.0473
the statutes , similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath .	555.4544
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday .	985.4866
the only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday ' ' , the council ' s resolution said .	281.16983
the small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community ' ' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors ' ' .	215.44003
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue ' ' to the local government .	573.613
the council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business ' ' on sunday .	615.8281
they `` operate on a volume basis ' ' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community ' ' .	148.72324
liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , george h . reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .	1149.7063
mr . reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheraton-biltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare ' ' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .	328.1768
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .	1461.8674
he said he was `` confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 1910 ' ' .	159.78233
that , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade .	379.9422
`` that was before i studied law .	902.3984
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party .	793.6223
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track .	1787.8619
he steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track ' ' .	253.02148
he said that when he was a socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources .	321.59088
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .	504.46252
mr . reama , who retired as vice president of the american screw co . in 1955 said , `` both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it ' ' .	323.4204
he said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze ' ' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .	487.09323
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , mr . reama said `` a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own ' ' .	301.44705
mr . reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .	1975.7119
a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1 , 700 johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .	549.8066
william a . martinelli , chairman of the citizens group of johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr . .	942.87134
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and mr . martinelli happens to hold that post .	724.6526
mr . martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .	563.087
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work .	592.3274
a difference of opinion arose between mr . martinelli and john p . bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .	290.7212
mr . martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while mr . bourcier said that a special election might be called instead .	227.98293
mr . bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .	1035.9752
he assured mr . martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .	267.76068
mr . martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .	465.44363
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .	500.85956
`` after inspiring this , i think we should certainly follow through on it ' ' , he declared .	103.798676
`` it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement ' ' .	270.0085
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission .	405.8141
`` our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement ' ' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town ' ' .	104.14333
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september .	471.2215
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town ' s insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .	968.31177
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .	358.8613
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses ' ' .	625.57587
several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system .	377.95886
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at monday ' s special north providence town council meeting .	2357.4463
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a . abatuno to draft the ordinance .	4941.577
at the last session of the general assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .	526.5139
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .	341.80142
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition .	530.71704
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .	772.2506
-- james p . mitchell and sen . walter h . jones r-bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j . hughes , democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the gop is `` campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism ' ' .	446.24142
mitchell was for using it , jones against , and sen . wayne dumont jr . r-warren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park hotel .	1205.564
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club .	1291.2166
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of women ' s clubs .	1184.0233
hughes said monday , `` it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired .	776.70734
now he ' s gone , the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state ' ' .	140.82639
sunday he had added , `` we can love eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership ' ' .	226.47005
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .	242.78076
`` how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ' ' ? ?	279.34744
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy ' ' while working in his adminstration .	1217.7727
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall ' s presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue .	429.40268
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .	413.13885
`` he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign ' ' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign ' ' .	304.66116
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes ' remark .	2319.3008
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary .	628.86633
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .	98.99911
state aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority , and making new jersey attractive to new industry .	428.16528
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republican-controlled state senate `` must share the blame for this ' ' .	334.50494
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co . plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .	304.45477
`` but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time ' ' , mitchell said .	198.52045
jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for mitchell .	743.8967
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises .	522.5511
`` he calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can ' t have it both ways ' ' , jones said .	366.91177
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue ' ' .	456.883
earlier , mitchell said in a statement	103.391685
`` i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j . hughes .	1559.8464
his reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president ' s leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations .	283.23526
`` i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .	774.652
`` such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .	345.89694
it can only rebound to mr . hughes ' discredit ' ' .	123.108955
sen . charles w . sandman , r-cape may , said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .	1006.1741
sandman , state campaign chairman for jones , was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel , newark , of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones .	569.581
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican party ' s nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .	478.60132
sandman said `` the announcement that sen . clifford case aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr . mitchell is a dead giveaway .	843.9404
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jersey ' s problems .	965.6761
`` we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr . mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington .	440.98157
`` we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr . mitchell some of the glow of sen . case ' s candidacy of last year .	251.42407
that , too , will fail ' ' .	42.58861
sandman announced the appointment of mrs . harriet copeland greenfield of 330 woodland ave . , westfield , as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee .	962.8704
mrs . greenfield is president of the westfield women ' s republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman .	718.23035
county supervisor weldon r . sheets , who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them .	541.8122
the proposal , sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a `` lip service word ' ' .	433.26935
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .	797.2925
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january , 1964 .	568.6172
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines .	1997.2363
the candidacy of mayor james j . sheeran of west orange , for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county , was supported today by edward w . roos , west orange public safety commissioner .	1040.4049
sheeran , a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organization ' s candidate , freeholder william macdonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy , now a member of the state board of tax appeals .	654.4968
`` my experience as public safety commissioner ' ' , roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .	448.0604
jim sheeran fits that description ' ' .	47.092457
-- william j . seidel , state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development , has retired after 36 years of service .	1133.9502
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a . bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state .	631.91614
seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies .	1108.9347
in october 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section .	389.15244
under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting .	2759.199
he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station .	913.78687
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens .	1975.1241
he is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the red cross and state department of education .	856.86115
-- richard j . hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state ' ' .	443.62613
he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn `` when i come back here after the november election you ' ll think , ' you ' re my man -- you ' re the kind of governor we ' re glad we elected ' ' ' .	614.00055
he said , `` we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time ' ' .	282.51053
in his only attack on the republicans , hughes said , `` the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .	662.4762
but we ' ll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .	497.01422
we ' ll not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson .	201.7752
`` we ' ll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november ' ' .	146.44522
he said , `` you can see signs of the republicans ' feeble attack on the meyner administration .	341.56747
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead ' ' .	128.77031
he urged new jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy ' ' .	210.28275
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .	429.73203
`` we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean ' ' , the former superior court judge said .	383.80084
`` to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early 1940s ' ' .	306.3143
calling the democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people ' ' , hughes asked , `` a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november ' ' .	340.48526
hughes supported gov . meyner ' s `` green acres ' ' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development .	527.96704
he said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday .	618.0312
the plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state .	537.4241
the other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis .	1002.90485
hughes said , `` this is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it ' ' , pointing out the state population has increased 125 , 000 each year since 1950 .	436.63028
he said `` morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve ' ' .	340.90668
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved .	481.68137
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans .	264.8866
`` after the primary ' ' , he promised , `` i ' ll be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration .	152.00565
i ' m not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee ' ' .	603.6354
-- fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .	891.82306
the outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the april 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by .	1726.7383
there may be other 1961 state committee retirements come april 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters .	745.1564
a special presentation was made to mrs . geraldine thompson of red bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .	689.37524
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women ' s suffrage amendment .	1029.56
she served one four-year term on the national committee .	230.90967
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r . screvane and abraham d . beame as running mates .	1221.2762
at the same time reaction among anti-organization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayor ' s reported plan was generally favorable .	672.6687
some anti-organization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .	313.44098
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayor ' s efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .	800.1645
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr . wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .	256.35437
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr . wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept . 7 democratic primary .	655.11725
these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr . wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city .	153.32968
their view is that last-minute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor .	759.4617
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , mr . wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a . buckley , the bronx democratic leader , and with joseph t . sharkey , the brooklyn democratic leader .	1131.6184
as usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g . de sapio , the manhattan leader .	338.5274
he is publicly on record as believing mr . de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party .	177.18344
last night the mayor visited mr . buckley at the bronx leader ' s home for a discussion of the situation .	132.16849
apparently he believes mr . buckley holds the key to the democratic organization ' s acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .	326.85776
in talks with mr . buckley last week in washington , the mayor apparently received the bronx leader ' s assent to dropping controller lawrence e . gerosa , who lives in the bronx , from this year ' s ticket .	297.42947
but mr . buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr . gerosa ' s successor .	183.6148
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr . screvane , who lives in queens , to replace abe stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for president of the city council and mr . beame , who lives in brooklyn , to replace mr . gerosa as the candidate for controller .	372.48227
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx .	1440.4459
after his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday ' s new york times .	366.72653
`` it didn ' t come from me .	51.455345
but as i have said before , if i announce my candidacy , i will have something definite to say about running mates ' ' .	455.9641
-- a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts .	815.87164
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics .	418.63693
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same ' ' .	194.30734
`` it ' s ' see joe , see jim ' ' ' , he says .	212.95891
`` the hand is out ' ' .	20.794678
a political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters ' ' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control .	718.04266
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them ' ' .	251.13148
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin o ' connor ' s novel , `` the last hurrah ' ' .	239.82292
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .	178.3902
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .	730.8835
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations .	522.9771
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state .	410.2875
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in massachusetts public life .	873.9091
day after day some new episode is reported .	566.65155
the state public works department is accused of having spent $8 , 555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property .	1299.5602

-- congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .	1625.2578
in the senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .	646.72485
in the house , the southern-republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administration ' s housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill .	719.33466
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee .	267.5631
it is expected to be reported out tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .	282.20718
the panel ' s action depends on the return of representative james w . trimble , democrat of arkansas , who has been siding with speaker sam rayburn ' s forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor .	368.8584
mr . trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday .	247.80977
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans .	463.48648
the democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .	438.7794
the $6 , 100 , 000 , 000 measure , which was passed last monday by the senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families .	1359.5616
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .	2289.3462
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee , where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy .	681.9841
they are james j . delaney of queens and thomas p . o ' neill jr . of massachusetts .	116.13747
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 1958 .	887.4896
this would provide for long-term federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .	3112.4373
mr . delaney and mr . o ' neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee .	629.5588
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .	317.41727
in the $40 , 000 , 000 budget that has been submitted for congressional approval , $26 , 000 , 000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .	459.11166
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , gordon boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a washington interview .	777.45624
six of these were proposed by religious groups .	791.19836
they will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in southeast asia , africa , the middle east and latin america .	471.3008
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .	311.61438
there are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example	374.03125
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .	542.05536
when he protested , the hotel owner said	840.33
`` why do you worry ? ?	465.3218
the u . s . government is paying for it .	208.50061
the u . s . government pays for all its overseas workers ' ' .	321.13406
`` i don ' t work for the government ' ' , the american said .	48.211163
`` same thing ' ' , he said .	8.936599
and then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem	988.1787
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ?	402.1813
r . sargent shriver jr . , director of the corps , is certain that they can .	77.45452
no religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes .	1408.769
-- at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia , premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming `` look , he took everything i had ' ' ! !	296.4731

indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of asia , africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid .	721.1835
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations .	561.0286
the communist countries allocated more than $1 , 000 , 000 , 000 in economic aid alone last year , according to western estimates .	197.01144
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .	1161.758
in 1960 more than 6 , 000 communist technicians were present in those countries .	455.88583
united nations , n . y . , june 18	32.21347
-- a committee of experts has recommended that a country ' s population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations .	273.36005
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations .	347.625
one effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india .	341.65836
india is the most populous united nations member with more than 400 , 000 , 000 inhabitants .	657.47876

-- the three leaders of laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom .	2195.5789
the decision was made in zurich by prince boun oum , premier of the pro-western royal government	926.26294
prince souvanna phouma , leader of the nation ' s neutralists and recognized as premier by the communist bloc , and prince souphanouvong , head of the pro-communist pathet lao forces .	639.4433
their joint statement was welcomed by the western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of laos .	910.8609
an agreement among the princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded .	2050.5122
but no one was overly optimistic .	2617.588
w . averell harriman of the united states , malcolm macdonald of britain , maurice couve de murville , france ' s foreign minister , and howard c . green , canada ' s minister of external affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference .	435.10638
the pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week .	1560.205
princess moune , prince souvanna phouma ' s young daughter , read the princes ' statement .	265.24075
they had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation ' ' , she said .	236.65372
the three laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .	467.53146
the princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .	471.00293
the meetings in zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government .	421.45624
appointment of william s . pfaff jr . , 41 , as promotion manager of the times-picayune publishing company was announced saturday by john f . tims , president of the company .	456.63165

-- thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan . 20 .	1077.7592
assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f . kennedy and retiring president dwight d . eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route .	1922.0593
pennsylvania avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint .	250.07024
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .	2697.5063
within view of the avenue are some of the united states government ' s tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .	294.90314
of course , 1600 pennsylvania , the white house , is the most famous address of the free world .	210.60425
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high .	1138.9122
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old .	621.4992
in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .	1200.6543
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote .	127.7667
in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .	164.18434
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in 1865 is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country ' s most valuable records are kept .	766.25775
also the department of justice building is located where j . edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation .	1436.3436
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground .	575.43646
many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square , opposite the white house .	2176.9612
in this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen . andrew jackson , hero of the battle of new orleans .	338.66125
moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least 40 marching units .	1088.1682
about 16 , 000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .	115.34572
division one of the parade will be the service academies .	530.38995
division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas , the respective states of the president and of vice-president l . b . johnson .	357.99924
then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .	169.94238
division three will be headed by the marines followed by 12 states	1494.783
division four will be headed by the navy , followed by 11 states	508.93207
division five , by the air force followed by 11 states .	686.0821
division six will be headed by the coast guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , puerto rico , the virgin islands , guam , american samoa , the trust territories and the canal zone .	1025.979
-- what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi ? ?	508.91434
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state ' s immediate political future .	358.0641
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- gov . ross barnett .	537.9276
barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .	871.63885
consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year .	1164.3701
some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .	645.5667
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor ' s office .	1279.853
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble .	984.7872
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon ' ' he had in the 1960 legislative session .	407.16974
if barnett doesn ' t call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session .	177.20363
the odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .	253.23837
legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22 . 50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating .	876.141
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .	89.25679
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state ' s congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .	416.78873
with eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic delta district , and congressman frank e . smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature .	507.09833
mississippi ' s relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house .	216.48236
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck .	2289.8481
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .	411.2698
barnett , as the titular head of the democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary .	1250.0729
with a democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election .	578.10583
now , the picture is clouded , and even us sens . james o . eastland and john c . stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .	908.5601
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .	728.4417
-- the gov . jimmie h . davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor ' s theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .	540.5555
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .	895.45013
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government .	1181.259
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .	346.99088
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .	361.016
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .	611.881
indeed , the administration ' s curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .	335.98682
the administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .	1627.8289
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .	1630.8922
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes .	1080.744
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy .	592.1531
if it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .	246.32361
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature .	110.6543
actually , davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .	1661.3444
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration .	3306.5088
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly .	7544.2373
they would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual .	400.697
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition .	722.71326
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .	238.67696
then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .	627.0763
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .	284.97717
but if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .	445.08307
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash .	886.0976
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .	529.99176
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma .	378.91382
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .	812.7106
in either case , it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .	1020.9056
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .	791.7807
it is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .	203.32225
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature .	442.83524
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .	495.03006
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .	461.31665
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .	1100.4056
the new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .	1038.1144
city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track ' ' with the city .	918.98065
estimates of the city ' s loss in the $344 , 000 job have ranged as high as $200 , 000 .	421.2726
hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co . contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate ' ' bids of competing contractors .	960.21936
the hughes concern then took `` shortcuts ' ' on the project but got paid anyway , hemphill said .	638.2206
the controller ' s charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday	1336.492
the city has sued for the full amount of the $172 , 400 performance bond covering the contract .	625.6686
the philadelphia transportation co . is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project .	477.7089
the signature of harold v . varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project .	685.34283
varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor .	472.1585
managing director donald c . wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter .	394.09482
the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959 .	592.5
the hughes company and the consolidated industries , inc . , both of 3646 n . 2d st . , filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law .	642.4051
on monday , the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization .	1077.3224
business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c . crumlish , jr . .	575.9077
the suit was filed later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms .	1156.9164
travelers indemnity co . and the continental casualty co . .	483.56244
at berger ' s direction , the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u . s . district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there .	416.41287
`` i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated ' ' , berger said .	481.3638
the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track .	2833.4443
the city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , hemphill charged .	838.1874
hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint .	593.86127
the bid from a . belanger and sons of cambridge , mass . , which listed the same officers as hughes , was $600 per joint .	825.0104
but , hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint .	8030.2773
berger ' s decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference .	336.9066
wagner said the city paid only $37 , 500 to the hughes company .	653.9515
`` we won ' t know the full amount until we get a full report ' ' , wagner said .	176.90712
`` we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond ' ' , berger said .	251.14464
wagner replied , `` can ' t you just see the headline ' city hooked for $172 , 000 ' ' ' ? ?	337.14377
berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount ' ' .	95.48781
douglas m . pratt , president of the ptc , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el .	233.6826
`` we want to find out who knew about it ' ' , pratt said .	144.75626
`` certain people must have known about it ' ' .	46.25475
`` the ptc is investigating the whole matter ' ' , pratt said .	251.10284
samuel d . goodis , representing the philadelphia hotel association , objected on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year .	1089.7955
goodis voiced his objection before city council ' s finance committee .	296.86963
for hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , goodis said .	719.7557
his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services .	650.522
the new fees are expected to raise an additional $740 , 000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2 , 330 , 000 more a year after that .	419.46
the ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room .	1526.1923
the cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 .	935.53613
goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels .	2463.8728
the city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457 , 000 a year .	773.9154
the increase also was opposed by leonard kaplan , spokesman for the home builders association of philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses .	1446.7161
a proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from councilwoman virginia knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs .	6126.032
the ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog .	932.6356
mrs . knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city ' s services to animal care .	272.75812
in reply , deputy police commissioner howard r . leary said that the city spends more than $115 , 000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43 , 000 in fees .	2063.8975
he reported that the city ' s contributions for animal care included $67 , 000 to the women ' s s . p . c . a .	252.93259
$15 , 000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15 , 000 to investigate dog bites .	4663.636
city finance director richard j . mcconnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year .	315.75943
the city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said .	417.67386
the new fee schedule also was supported by commissioner of licenses and inspections barnet lieberman and health commissioner eugene a . gillis .	5873.15
petitions asking for a jail term for norristown attorney julian w . barnard will be presented to the montgomery county court friday , it was disclosed tuesday by horace a . davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last nov . 1 by barnard ' s hit-run car .	1034.7479
the petitions will be presented in open court to president judge william f . dannehower , davenport said .	1354.5248
barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by judge warren k . hess , and placed on two years ' probation providing he does not drive during that time .	962.9025
he was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning .	353.33475
victim of the accident was robert lee stansbery , 39 .	2568.584
his widow started the circulation of petitions after barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation .	6635.3906
the city planning commission on tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the redevelopment authority for the purchase of land in the $300 , 000 , 000 eastwick redevelopment area project .	685.94635
the commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project .	857.18115
one of the agreements calls for the new eastwick corp . to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12 , 192 , 865 .	2476.998
the tract is bounded by island ave . , dicks ave . , 61st st . , and eastwick ave . .	690.5662
it is designated as stage 1 residential on the redevelopment authority ' s master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores .	807.9121
the corporation was formed by the reynolds metal co . and the samuel a . and henry a . berger firm , a philadelphia builder , for work in the project .	178.56824
the second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of stage 1 residential to philadelphia builders eastwick corp . , a firm composed of 10 philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project .	1019.5512
the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by dr . constantinos a . doxiadis , former minister of reconstruction in greece and a consulting planner for the new eastwick corp . .	1609.039
the plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic .	2058.0676
it provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project .	834.5037
the esplanade eliminates grovers ave . , which on original plans ran through the center of the development .	207.80434
the esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project .	817.9849
kansas city , mo . , feb . 9 ( upi )	30.726452
-- the president of the kansas city local of the international association of fire fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work .	1069.8938
battalion chief stanton m . gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles .	744.53625
he was in baptist memorial hospital .	885.9856
the battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work .	424.1034
`` i ' d just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and i was lying on the driveway ' ' , he said .	216.64645
gladden ' s wife and two of his sons , john , 17 , and jim , 13 , were inside the house .	191.80957
the younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall .	712.5527
the explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house .	222.1449
the left front wheel landed 100 feet away .	2573.9355
police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either tnt or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel .	1876.9888
it was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car ' s starter .	392.11823
gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night .	654.7437
the fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union .	905.2721
gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union ' s battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 .	668.35016
the fire fighters association here offered a $5 , 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing .	565.09515
a $500 reward was offered by the association ' s local in kansas city , kas . .	415.84262
the association said it would post 24 hour guards at gladden ' s home and at those of james mining and eugene shiflett .	2123.749
mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and shiflett is a member of its executive committee .	283.5446
both have been active in the association .	52.779526
ankara , turkey , oct . 24 ( ap )	54.15256
-- turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen . cemal gursel as president .	1334.7673
an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct . 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d ' etat .	696.19244
by-passing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by gen . cedvet sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government .	1096.9663
the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen . gursel as president .	2044.9427
gen . gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months .	1145.3086
the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned .	563.62933
party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own .	408.08487
vincent g . ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced monday by charles e . raymond , district attorney .	869.06085
ierulli will replace desmond d . connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by march 31 .	588.7759

he is a graduate of portland university and the northwestern college of law .	401.4892
he is married and the father of three children .	184.91112
helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , e . m . martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night .	404.1541
martin , who has been in office in washington , d . c . , for 13 months spoke at the council ' s annual meeting at the multnomah hotel .	160.09265
he told some 350 persons that the united states ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths .	485.19077
`` we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours ' ' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty .	286.63068
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the soviet union .	225.1551
he cited east germany where after 15 years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up ' ' .	208.22998
martin called for patience on the part of americans .	77.90006
`` the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build ' ' , he said .	141.6173
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said .	184.69743
`` we have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient ' ' , the assistant secretary said .	193.72661
economically , martin said , the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves .	741.39984
private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves .	218.33667
the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a `` social cost ' ' .	199.6643
martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country .	431.98682
the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portland ' s civil defense more plans for the city ' s schools in event of attack .	599.11066
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow .	238.51813
the board members , after hearing the coordination plea from mrs . ralph h . molvar , 1409 sw maplecrest dr . , said they thought they had already been cooperating .	2042.7577
chairman c . richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go .	515.9601
dr . melvin w . barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful ' ' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district .	271.80734
`` los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster ' ' , he said .	98.56773
`` nobody really expects to evacuate .	799.07513
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following .	235.82802
mrs . molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand ' ' , said , `` we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn ' t be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children ' ' .	317.575
dr . barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work ' ' .	222.00713
mrs . molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowe ' s program .	508.438
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting .	312.26456
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done .	158.39095

a stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the assemblies of god , in session at the memorial coliseum .	720.7877
the council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination ' s 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 .	454.60205
the changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible .	342.06378
the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible .	770.8673
at the adoption , the rev . t . f . zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives ' ' .	254.50232
many changes involved minor editing and clarification	13455.818
however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list .	685.2791
the first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads	1283.6766
`` the scriptures , both old and new testament , are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct ' ' .	326.4484

`` surveys show that one out of three americans has vital contact with the church .	456.87796
this means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life ' ' , he told delegates friday .	353.93323
talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12 , 000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the united states every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge ' ' .	602.899
`` in 35 years we have opened 7 , 000 churches ' ' , the rev . mr . brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10 , 000 persons .	200.67433
`` in this light we need 1 , 000 churches in illinois , where we have 200	1488.3171
800 in southern new england , we have 60	184.67938
we need 100 in rhode island , we have none ' ' , he said .	26.635664
to step up the denomination ' s program , the rev . mr . brandt suggested the vision of 8 , 000 new assemblies of god churches in the next 10 years .	173.82683
to accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said .	306.2581
`` the church ' s ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour ' ' .	144.13823

u . s . dist . judge charles l . powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in portland ' s insurance fraud trial .	1455.3267
denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict .	1312.6902
in denying motions for dismissal , judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are ' ' .	470.90005
attorney dwight l . schwab , in behalf of defendant philip weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy , but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide .	1655.4293
schwab also declared there is no proof of weinstein ' s entering a conspiracy to use the u . s . mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor a . lawrence burbank replied	502.83353
`` it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the u . s . mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out ' ' .	275.04672
in the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case .	684.7059
-- the orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen major-league clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the kansas city athletics by a score of 5 to 3 .	1094.3572
indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage .	1395.2715
over the first five frames , jack fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 american league pennant , held the a ' s scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .	1297.087
then dick hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock .	4217.594
a two-run homer by norm siebern and a solo blast by bill tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .	2416.0352
with one down in the eighth , marv throneberry drew a walk and stole second as hyde fanned tuttle .	4567.693
catcher frank house ' s throw in an effort to nab throneberry was wide and in the dirt .	575.14734
then heywood sullivan , kansas city catcher , singled up the middle and throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .	746.35474
rookie southpaw george stepanovich relieved hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the a ' s fifth tally on a walk to second baseman dick howser , a wild pitch , and frank cipriani ' s single under shortstop jerry adair ' s glove into center .	1065.4843
the orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three kansas city pitchers .	2800.9841
three were doubles , brooks robinson getting a pair and marv breeding one .	3955.9692
bill kunkel , bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in miami stadium .	1975.9653
the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth .	663.4378
hartman , purchased by the a ' s from the milwaukee braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph .	1081.9119
keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the orioles ' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally .	1428.9792
in the ninth , robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left .	1255.5061
whitey herzog , performing in right as the orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked keegan for a base on balls .	1214.4031
then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce .	151.8344
pete ward was sent in for house and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to howser on the grass back of short .	750.136
john powell , batting for adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and buddy barker , up for stepanovich , bounced out sharply to jerry lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest .	4428.2617
the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding , along with robinson , the two birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on russ snyder ' s single to right and crossed on kunkel ' s wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate .	610.55835
the flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out .	946.582
jackie brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .	284.17343
jim gentile bounced a hard shot off kunkel ' s glove and beat it out for a single , and when lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman throneberry ' s head brandt took third and gentile second on the error .	775.5996
then robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners .	1124.9598
when robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , tuttle to andy carey .	1016.4925
the detailed rundown on the kansas city scoring in the sixth went like this	862.09344
lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face hyde and romped around as siebern blasted hyde ' s next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center .	3608.2632
carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first .	2248.46
it was ruled a difficult chance and a hit .	2585.0684
then throneberry rapped into a fast double play .	539.7421
breeding to adair to gentile , setting up tuttle ' s 390-foot homer over the wall in left center .	1613.5328
if the orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the american league champion new york yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test sunday afternoon .	366.18344
-- the flavor of baltimore ' s florida grapefruit league news ripened considerably late today when the orioles were advised that ron hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the army ' s military training program and is ready for belated spring training .	3732.1545
hansen , who slugged the 1960 oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a	1795.9689
freshman average , completes the birds ' spring squad at 49 players .	1364.0358
the big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 american league `` rookie-of-the-year ' ' , flew here late this afternoon from baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15 , 000 and was a spectator at tonight ' s 5-to-3 loss to kansas city -- the winless birds ' sixth setback in a row .	1123.8955
the 6-foot 3-inch hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring .	1296.5527
he hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the flock breaks camp three weeks hence .	1258.1052
when he was inducted into the army at fort knox , ky . , hansen ' s weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best ' ' he said .	265.142
`` i feel good physically ' ' , hansen added , `` but i think i ' ll move better carrying a little less weight than i ' m carrying now ' ' .	292.7148
the rangy , albany ( cal . ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding ' ' as his 1961 goal .	758.265
`` i think i can do a better job with the glove , now that i know the hitters around the league a little better ' ' , he said .	160.38116
hansen will engage in his first workout at miami stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the new york yankees .	1423.556
skinny brown and hoyt wilhelm , the flock ' s veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the american league champions in tomorrow ' s 8 p . m . contest .	575.55225
ryne duren and roland sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the yanks ' auburn ( n . y . ) farm club of the class-d new york-pennsylvania league , are the probable rival pitchers .	1450.5691
twenty-one-year-old milt pappas and jerry walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the oriole mound chores against the bombers ' art ditmar in sunday ' s 2 p . m . encounter .	635.37146
ralph houk , successor to casey stengel at the yankee helm , plans to bring the entire new york squad here from st . petersburg , including joe dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games .	930.8869
the famed yankee clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach .	784.93115
pitcher steve barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the army ' s accelerated wintertime military course , also at fort knox , ky . .	992.314
the 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did hansen .	1850.3585
baltimore ' s bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as manager paul richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit .	1524.1835
`` take a ride on this one ' ' , brooks robinson greeted hansen as the bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight .	3138.8716
it was the first of two doubles by robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate .	449.93414
just before game time , robinson ' s pretty wife , connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer .	694.4365
unfortunately , brooks ' s teammates were not in such festive mood as the orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three kansas city rookie hurlers .	4317.245
hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with lee macphail	5470.7554
j . a . w . iglehart , chairman of the oriole board of directors , and public relations director jack dunn .	1018.08545
their flight was delayed , dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane .	796.1664
ex-oriole clint courtney , now catching for the a ' s is all for the american league ' s 1961 expansion to the west coast .	269.08878

garden fresh , the result of a mating of better self and rosy fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the st . patrick ' s day purse with some speed in reserve .	513.0519
she was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10 , 000 claiming event .	642.7164
cleveland , march 17 ( ap )	21.47572
-- george kerr , the swift-striding jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the knights of columbus track meet tonight , beating purdue ' s dave mills in a hot duel in 1 . 10 . 1 .	1556.5764
kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in new york with a clocking of 1 . 09 . 3 , wiped out mills ' s early pace and beat the young big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards .	1042.979
both were under the meet mark of 1 . 10 . 8 set in 1950 by mal whitfield .	1932.3932
mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .	397.06665
then kerr , a graduate student from illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off mills ' s challenge on the final turn .	773.4668

-- two errors by new york yankee shortstop tony kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the chicago white sox today .	5168.939
-- a texas halfback who doesn ' t even know the team ' s plays , eldon moritz , ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games .	749.4742
time stands still every time moritz , a 26-year-old army signal corps veteran , goes into the field .	3743.7437
although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every saturday , in fact -- out of football .	419.1065
moritz doesn ' t even have a nose guard or hip pads but he ' s one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl .	648.1005
that ' s because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries .	1377.3448
he ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of washington state .	2264.0774
moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team .	857.58795
but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and you ' ll get the quick response , `` place-kicker ' ' .	294.95193
a 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from stamford , moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .	19412.02
last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn ' t get into a single game .	218.40833
`` this year , coach royal told me if i ' d work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me ' ' , said moritz .	506.06012
`` so i started practicing on it in spring training .	827.26685
moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough .	404.42343
moritz said monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week .	457.0122
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school , including one that beat anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game .	1050.0775
`` i kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school ' ' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time .	339.81055
i never did miss one in a playoff game -- i kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years ' ' .	599.6897
moritz came to texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury .	1227.9794
he missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 .	770.0323
his statistical record that year , when texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards .	907.91174
he went into the army in march , 1957 , and returned two years later .	178.1295
but he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season .	479.52487
place kicking is largely a matter of timing , moritz declared .	2014.7888
`` once you get the feel of it , there ' s not much to it .	88.52145
i ' ve tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can ' t seem to get the feel .	175.73149
practice helps you to get your timing down .	653.6821
`` it ' s kind of like golf -- if you don ' t swing a club very often , your timing gets off ' ' .	331.09564
moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session .	1999.5653
`` if you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead ' ' , he explained .	447.69968
in their first three games , the longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent	411.55405
their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries .	1371.8063
tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries	5410.4443
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games .	1680.1207
saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the washington state game , for four plays he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench .	1034.9137
wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists he ' ll be ready for oklahoma .	333.06802
last week , when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conference ' s top four in rushing , he said `` that won ' t last long ' ' .	513.5539
monday , he had four longhorns in the top four .	737.45514
a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday , but attention quickly turned from saturday ' s victory to next week ' s problem rice university .	806.175
the mustangs don ' t play this week .	55.309975
`` we ' re just real happy for the players ' ' , coach bill meek said of the 9-7 victory over the air force academy .	886.9312
`` i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on .	701.71704
it was the first time we ' ve been ahead this season ( when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) ' ' .	747.35297
assistant coach john cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , i think , on the part of the coaches and the players .	97.25847
we needed it and we got it ' ' .	36.51422
meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon .	2118.12
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .	343.62994
`` nelson played magnificent football ' ' , meek praised .	279.45856
`` he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times .	646.0166
and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown .	3656.8665
he broke that boy ( air force fullback nick arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football ' ' .	1595.8209
gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages .	780.27655
one was on a fourth-down screen pass from the mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into gannon ' s territory .	4372.3154
`` as soon as it started to form , gannon spotted it ' ' , meek said .	341.63947
`` he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback terry isaacson ) had time to turn around .	544.1637
he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss ' ' .	180.27385
the air force ' s , and the game ' s , final play , was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .	934.0393
`` he just lay back there and waited for it ' ' , meek said .	182.4381
`` he almost brought it back all the way ' ' .	66.32645
except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice , meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice .	2527.8828
`` kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game ' ' , meek said .	195.29465
`` he ' ll be out of action all this week .	216.59627
he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .	273.42758
there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee ' ' .	466.8854
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland .	1343.584
`` he ' s looking a lot better , and he ' s able to run ' ' , meek explained .	140.90633
`` we ' ll let him do a lot of running this week , but i don ' t know if he ' ll be able to play ' ' .	69.58118
the game players saw the air force film monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .	588.97833
`` we ' ll work hard tuesday , wednesday and thursday ' ' , meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage friday .	525.18024
we ' ll work out about an hour on saturday , then we ' ll work monday and tuesday of next week , then taper off ' ' .	302.7185
smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday , oct . 21 .	810.87305
-- held out of texas tech ' s sweat-suits drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the raiders ' 38-7 loss to texas a & m because of its important game with arkansas coming up saturday , baylor worked out in the rain monday -- mud or no mud .	2014.1194
end gene raesz , who broke a hand in the owl ' s game with lsu , was back working out with rice monday , and john nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week ' s idleness with an ankle injury .	910.5478
the texas aggies got a day off monday -- a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night , but myers announced that halfback george hargett , shaken up in the tech game , would not play against trinity saturday .	1414.9891
halfback bud priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined tcu ' s workout monday .	3427.9512
the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the denver broncos -- but their visit will be a short one .	1429.8646
the texans have two more road games -- at buffalo and houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach hank stram ' s men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .	926.9889
buffalo coach buster ramsey , who has become one of the game ' s greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-national football leaguers , m . c . reynolds and warren rabb .	849.30725
rabb , the former louisiana state field general , came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the houston oilers , defending league champions .	1528.2756
`` just our luck ' ' ! !	5.9689965
`` buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ' ' .	886.0249
ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver , and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , jack spikes , though he did the team ' s place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .	959.4756
`` our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well ' ' , said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .	834.2972
`` in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job ' ' .	271.04736
the texans won the game through ball control , with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only 17 passes .	3402.7866
`` we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack ' ' , explained stram .	727.58984
`` they can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble ' ' .	799.0016
the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans , but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .	402.1669
the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes , the flashy halfback .	1671.9921
he was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards .	1662.6361
the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denver ' s al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas .	2995.2063
`` that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away ' ' , said stram , quipping , `` i think i ' ll put that play in the book ' ' .	270.2038
the early southwest conference football leaders -- texas , arkansas and texas a & m -- made a big dent in the statistics last week .	1064.5636
texas ' 545-yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1 , 512 yards ( 1 , 065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new swc high .	2951.8691
arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip tcu , and a & m , with a 38-point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .	2841.0625
completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .	2576.5278
texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to baylor ' s 126 ) , but idle baylor has the best defensive record ( 187 . 5 yards per game to texas ' 189 ) .	1206.0245
a & m has the best defense against passes , 34 . 7 yards per game .	733.35443
not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology .	986.14044
rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis , 5-3 .	2574.2732
the husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the denver area .	1437.3864
it was nischwitz ' third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies ' winning streak to four straight .	1507.1333
they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack .	737.43195
nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning .	1414.9182
he has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .	699.6883
the bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in sunday ' s opener , and never lagged .	340.08627
dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bear ' s attack .	1428.6597
after al paschal gruonded out , jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe .	2424.4043
alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left .	608.02985
jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don wert ' s smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout .	1657.668
the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzer ' s glove .	1776.7338
nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth .	1145.166
chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines ' infield roller accounted for the tallies .	7723.0557
the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusik ' s double and outfield flies by porter and wert .	1312.5156
gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth .	763.2795
despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1 48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play .	1030.4225
chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusik ' s grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .	881.3241
cliff cook accounted for three of the tribe ' s eight hits .	275.1442
it was the season ' s first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order .	312.36356
the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark .	2995.4578
mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ .	223.92351
among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , patti waggin who is mrs . don rudolph when off the stage .	1879.9419
lefty wyman carey , another denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at 8 o ' clock tuesday night .	1212.1848
ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn .	902.59033
dallas , tex . , may 1 -- ( ap )	107.6353
-- kenny lane of muskegon , mich . , world ' s seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over rip randall of tyler , tex . , here monday night .	2081.7336
st . paul-minneapolis , may 1 -- ( ap )	189.7949
-- billy gardner ' s line double , which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field , drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a 6-5 victory over the chicago white sox monday .	1154.843
lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center .	262.6749
he came all the way around on gardner ' s hit before 5777 fans .	4179.9067
it was gardner ' s second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year .	204.19513
turk lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while ray moore won his second game against a single loss .	569.83777
the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny green ' s double to left .	3582.431
the white sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly .	1414.4899
jim landis ' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a 1-0 lead , but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard .	1228.1744
al smith ' s 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and carreon ' s first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front .	749.36237
a double by green , allison ' s run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by lemon and gardner ' s solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth .	493.3779
ogden , utah , may 1 -- ( ap )	154.9697
-- boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball .	1963.3827
`` i ' ve had it ' ' , he told a newsman .	144.29668
`` i know when my reflexes are gone and i ' m not going to be any 25th man on the ball club ' ' .	248.20973
this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout .	5411.141
jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games .	2098.112
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno , nev . , where his wife , former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen , awaited .	1528.0555
she said , when she learned jackie was heading home `` i ' m just speculating , but i have to think jack feels he ' s hurting boston ' s chances ' ' .	504.19678
the union pacific railroad streamliner , city of san francisco , stopped in ogden , utah , for a few minutes .	615.79
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him .	472.4434
the conductor said to ritchie `` i don ' t think you want to talk to him .	118.78018
you ' ll probably get a ball bat on the head .	518.9879
he ' s mad at the world ' ' .	20.05417
but jackie had gone into the station .	126.27136
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .	221.63618
`` i told him who i was and he was quite cold .	203.08969
but he warmed up after a while .	252.03348
i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( liston ) got was through a keyhole .	1459.3739
he said he had never talked to liston ' ' .	105.406265
liston is bill liston , baseball writer for the boston traveler , who quoted jensen as saying	1336.6168
just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging .	3153.4563
and so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old warren spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the giants and the giants ' willie mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree sunday .	7423.5356
both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime .	997.76666
of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahn ' s hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts .	1933.278
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone .	2969.8772
and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` wish i was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer .	3078.4507
the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days .	932.3711
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game ' s history .	613.6765
yes , with bob grove , carl hubbell , herb pennock , art nehf , vernon gomez , et al .	3066.7678
spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player ' s ball player , as they say in the trade .	559.78925
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct . 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18 , 792 .	730.66534
`` spahnie doesn ' t know how to merely go through the motions ' ' , remarked enos slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .	974.4782
the spectacular mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .	1588.0433
incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .	627.1346
bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyn ' s ebbetts field .	1012.3326
ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies , the braves ' joe adcock , lou gehrig of the yankees , pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito , then with cleveland , made their history on the road .	1418.7543
willie ' s big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle .	2140.4927
this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you ' re an american or national fan and anti or pro-yankee .	1020.9645
the record books , however , would favor the giants ' ace .	368.04636
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .	3565.464
willie ' s lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond mickey ' s .	616.1897
the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukee ' s park .	1720.7659
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .	3526.8704
the denver-area tv audience was privileged to see mays ' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home .	880.11426
this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game ' s top rulers .	531.98566
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the `` living room athletic club ' ' when games were cut off .	887.9273
actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .	510.93298
this year , i am told , the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here .	609.21075
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .	626.2351
it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .	736.9145
you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy .	1083.2969
this dissatisfaction led to howsam ' s request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .	535.9375
-- the powerful new york yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed cincinnati , crushing the reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage monday in the loosely played finale .	10955.048
with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries , the american league champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game .	1531.6754
johnny blanchard , mantle ' s replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a 5-run first inning .	4380.053
hector lopez , subbing for berra , smashed a 3-run homer off bill henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth .	3508.908
the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors .	767.4231
the crowd of 32 , 589 had only two chances to applaud .	1726.8568
in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on .	772.5228
momentarily the reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .	1369.6409
in the fifth , wally post slashed a 2-run homer off bud daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn ' t matter .	1445.293
the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager .	594.8757
only bucky harris , the `` boy-manager ' ' of washington in 1924 , and eddie dyer of the st . louis cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .	388.97156
-- nick skorich , the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles , was elevated today to head coach .	915.8764
skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20 , 000 and $25 , 000 a year .	237.61237
he succeeds buck shaw , who retired at the end of last season .	167.59486
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaw ' s staff -- jerry williams and charlie gauer .	732.6892
skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings , the newest national football league entry .	1053.1318
van brocklin , the quarterback who led the eagles to the title , was signed by the vikings last wednesday .	888.4647
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .	442.3986
with skorich at the helm , the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .	508.08365
in the past the club depended largely on van brocklin ' s aerials .	1695.9332
skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing .	569.6905
skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at cincinnati university and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers .	2782.036
an injury forced skorich to quit after the 1948 season .	462.06012
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in 1949 .	587.897
he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy , n . y . .	616.0461
he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach .	2685.0264
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers .	922.15826
the eagles signed him for shaw ' s staff in 1959 .	158.79387
skorich began his new job auspiciously today .	7740.058
at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth , the eagles were honored for winning the championship .	864.41583
shaw and skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .	1353.0498
with the announcement of a `` special achievement award ' ' to william a . ( ( bill ) shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for sunday night ' s thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the new york chapter , baseball writers ' association of america , at the waldorf-astoria hotel .	401.50336
shea , the chairman of mayor wagner ' s baseball committee , will be joined on the dais by warren spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the milwaukee braves	1054.2004
bill mazeroski , the world series hero of the pittsburgh pirates , and casey stengel , the former manager of the yankees .	393.7284
mazeroski , whose homer beat the yankees in the final series game , will receive the babe ruth award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series .	560.1754
graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the william j . slocum memorial award .	901.62415
to spahn will go the sid mercer memorial award as the chapter ' s player of the year .	403.49057
a crowd of 1 , 400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song .	424.37973
the 53-year-old shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york .	578.1982
named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james a . farley , bernard gimbel and clint blume , shea worked relentlessly .	2136.0942
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city .	347.43542
the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees .	849.99554
despite countless barriers and disappointments , shea moved forward .	2105.9954
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another national league club to move here .	467.4124
when that failed , he enlisted branch rickey ' s aid in the formation of a third major league , the continental , with new york as the key franchise .	511.0261
the continental league never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand .	504.41684
the new york franchise is headed by mrs . charles shipman payson .	2089.6514
a big-league municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford c . frick .	611.7806
shea ' s efforts figure prominently in the new stadium .	1183.7715
shea and his wife , nori , make their home at sands point , l . i . .	789.0316
bill jr . , 20 , kathy , 15 , and patricia , 9 , round out the shea family .	714.57446
he attended new york university before switching to georgetown university in washington .	1139.9272
he played basketball there while working toward a law degree .	1345.9591
later , shea owned and operated the long island indians , a minor league professional football team .	1164.7295
he was the lawyer for ted collins ' old boston yankees in the national football league .	1116.5013
all was quiet in the office of the yankees and the local national leaguers yesterday .	332.75766
on friday , roger maris , the yankee outfielder and winner of the american league ' s most-valuable-player award , will meet with roy hamey , the general manager .	770.6549
maris is in line for a big raise .	261.4048
arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight .	1124.5828
the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre .	2854.4937
palmer , golf ' s leading money-winner in 1960 , and snead will be saluted as the winning team in the canada cup matches last june in dublin .	1589.9542
deane beman , the national amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including bob gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards .	1088.1842
the writers ' gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield , n . j . , and palm beach , fla . , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments .	434.78183
horton smith of detroit , a former president of the professional golfers association , will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness .	1132.2671
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington , democrat of missouri .	1019.3154
arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .	605.78125
he won the masters , the united states open and a record $80 , 738 in prize money .	530.0269
he was heralded as `` sportsman of the year ' ' by sports illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the `` professional athlete of the year ' ' , a distinction that earned for him the $10 , 000 diamond-studded hickok belt .	479.55435
but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .	2881.2405
a couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole .	1364.4385
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .	1862.0267
if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .	1002.03485
it was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold .	3195.4395
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .	683.2864
the world ' s best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .	862.4927
then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .	2835.0093
on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , arnold whipped into his second shot .	1116.2926
the ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice .	1307.0632
he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .	1767.2416
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .	423.7644
`` it is possible that i over-corrected ' ' , he said ruefully .	183.0609
each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .	3500.1416
so he wound up with a dozen .	289.77216
`` it was a nice round figure , that 12 ' ' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed .	410.5241
from the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open .	945.6016
the idol of the hackers , of course , is ray ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the united states open .	473.78253
their secondary hero is another pro , willie chisholm , who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully .	2156.2224
willie ' s partner was long jim barnes , who tried to keep count .	504.02567
`` how many is that , jim ' ' ? ?	89.50821
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project .	970.2867
`` thirteen ' ' , said long jim .	335.28745
`` nae , man ' ' , said willie , `` ye must be countin ' the echoes ' ' .	304.59213
nor were there any rules to save him .	407.09927
if there had been , he would have found a loophole , because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .	357.63547
this knowledge has come in handy , too .	405.78296
his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .	849.7196
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .	822.5444
arnold sent for joe dey , the executive secretary of the golf association .	377.91904
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .	901.59406
`` i knew it all along ' ' , confessed arnold with a grin , `` but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there ' ' .	284.35547
for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .	1737.6758
yet he remains the fiercest of competitors .	24014.852
he ' ll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he ' s right .	407.6146
that ' s how he first won the masters in 1958 .	386.8009
it happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder .	2718.155
arnold ' s iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force .	1993.1008
`` i can remove the ball , can ' t i ' ' ? ?	51.223186
`` no ' ' , said the official .	137.44345
`` you must play it where it lies ' ' .	117.98128
`` you ' re wrong ' ' , said arnold , a man who knows the rules .	141.17043
`` i ' ll do as you say , but i ' ll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling ' ' .	138.59325
he scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one .	339.01218
the golfing fathers ruled in his favor .	94.113754
so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .	481.9913
until a few weeks ago , however , arnold palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers .	676.72876
but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before .	181.15675
a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today .	838.76434
other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football ' s hall of fame , players ' benefits and constitutional amendments .	578.6157
the owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division .	880.1747
however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .	842.438
pete rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out	1611.6312
`` we ' ll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other ' ' .	95.35654
nine of the league ' s teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .	1394.2924
if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies , they won ' t be misled by the pirates ' slower start this season .	726.706
`` pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat ' ' , mauch said here the other day .	327.20456
`` the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year .	515.46924
they have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season , along with bobby shantz ' ' .	1312.7515
tonight at 8 o ' clock the cardinals , who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball ' s world champions .	364.95746
the pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the redbirds are 7-9 .	3308.392
solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from bob gibson to ernie broglio , for several reasons 1 broglio ' s 4-0 won-lost record and 1 . 24 earned-run mark against pittsburgh a year ago	2624.378
2 the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible	1510.439
3 the redbirds ' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the phillies sunday .	20406.773
manager hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment .	1439.6809
after thursday ' s open date , solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night .	2713.409
harvey haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonight ' s game at busch stadium .	1138.9639
boyer is suffering from a stiff neck .	582.03406
haddix has a 13-8 record against the redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 .	909.1486
pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadn ' t decided between mizell and vern law for wednesday ' s game .	929.4175
mizell has won both of his starts .	118.23556
after a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup .	859.12805
that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the giants .	810.47723
`` i have to stay with nieman for a while ' ' , hemus said .	271.21878
`` bill white ( sore ankles ) should be ready .	320.71036
with a lefthander going for pittsburgh , i may use don taussig in center ' ' .	230.07887
`` lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good ' ' , hemus said .	721.16693
`` he should be getting back in the groove before long .	723.5981
our pitching is much better than it has shown ' ' .	69.78403
the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice , but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday .	1570.1738
until the bucs ' bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .	2483.4648
despite the recession , pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess , gino cimoli , bill virdon , bob clemente and dick groat , each	7142.086
bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet .	2125.748
perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend , who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs .	467.35382
friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn ' t likely to see action here this week .	373.2297
`` we ' re getting friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good ' ' , murtaugh said .	298.57162
`` virdon has been blasting the ball .	1360.9491
the pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by may 1 last year , when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season .	826.87286
on last may 1 , the cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone .	2215.4426
in 1958 , the birds were 3-10 on may 1 .	2660.0845
a year later they were 4-13 .	4877.782
since 1949 , the st . louis club has been below on may 1 just four times .	264.68207
the ' 49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on may 23 before finishing with 96 victories .	3586.1843
the ' 52 cards were 6-7 on may 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club ' s top since 1949 .	1817.095
then last season the birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on may 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .	2752.7227
since 1949 , the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the ' 55 dodger team .	986.3869
those dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by may 8 .	2590.2717
the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new york ' s ' 51 giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .	577.18365
they honored the battling billikens last night .	333.69913
speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st . louis university players who , in the words of coach john benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than i did ' ' .	373.7075
the most valuable player award was split three ways , among glen mankowski , gordon hartweger and tom kieffer .	4162.2646
in addition , a special award was given to bob ( bevo ) nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury .	858.45605
`` you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing ' ' , benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different .	477.08264
the boys had a tremendous respect for each other ' s ability .	380.31305
they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do .	145.23651
`` several times i found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .	520.4044
we ' d be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say , ' don ' t worry , coach -- we ' ll get ' em all right ' ' ' .	304.4468
the trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by bob broeg , sports editor of the post-dispatch .	4054.1875
kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play .	544.45935
mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against bradley in st . louis u . ' s nationally televised victory .	530.15784
benington said , `` i ' ve never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day ' ' .	412.2043
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills .	529.05676
after the coach listed all the boy ' s faults , hartweger said , `` coach before i leave here , you ' ll get to like me ' ' .	154.81725
mrs . benington admired gordon ' s spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team .	287.36847
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` i want to thank coach ' s wife for talking him into letting me play ' ' .	306.47998
bob burnes , sports editor of the globe-democrat , presented bob nordmann with his award .	1957.3936
bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time .	396.6299
within a week after the injury , suffered in st . louis ' s victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament , nordmann was sitting on the bill ' s bench doing what he could to help benington .	286.00345
on the clock given him was the inscription , `` for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball , 1960-61 ' ' .	419.40955
other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the national invitation tournament were art hambric , donnell reid , bill nordmann , dave harris , dave luechtefeld and george latinovich .	4409.7446
`` this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future ' ' , benington pointed out .	221.62741
`` by winning against bradley , kentucky and notre dame on those teams ' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn ' t take a super team to do it ' ' .	398.98907
st . louis university found a way to win a baseball game .	248.75264
larry scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in billiken baseball history , as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college , 5-1 , at crystal city .	1332.9132
the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie .	584.0689
the tie was against southeast missouri last friday .	2692.555
scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , len boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple .	2442.399
st . louis u . was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against washington university at ligget field .	1065.8274
the game opened a busy week for washington .	389.18512
the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at 3 30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy , ill . , saturday .	1648.8677
if it ' s true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn ' t happy ball players produce more base hits ? ?	2400.3252
the two top talents of the time , mickey mantle and willie mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations .	622.25
and that ' s meant as a boost , not a knock .	517.72784
mays and mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they ' ve never hit the heights .	456.25446
mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the american league in home runs , 52 , and rbi ' s , 130 .	2284.2234
like the yankees ' slugger , mays , the terror of the giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- willie .	321.8265
his best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and ' 55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases .	3734.508
now , apparently happier under new managers , mays and mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they ' re going to pass those previous peaks .	582.2753
yes , we know , they ' re professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn ' t care how they ' re handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .	316.85428
the truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment .	677.7075
for that matter , stan musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort .	1076.6173
mantle , it ' s apparent , resented casey stengel ' s attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility .	955.8977
the old man was almost too possessive .	4827.2065
stengel inherited dimaggio , rizzuto , but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors , from joplin to new york .	668.23517
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , ol ' case wanted no . 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder .	1601.565
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats .	1224.1122
inheriting a more mature mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off broadway , ralph houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on mickey .	1271.9808
the major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead .	459.78183
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far .	872.5629
the opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in los angeles ' wrigley field jr . , mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , babe ruth ' s 60 homers of 1927 .	1151.7134
mays ' day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year .	851.26355
willie ' s wonderful walloping sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark .	1611.821
next to leo durocher , dark taught mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the polo grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the giants win a dramatic pennant .	1325.772

those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation army ' s social center at 1200 larimer st . .	2264.372
the pert , gray-haired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo , n . y . , is a `` civilian ' ' with the army .	102.48172
her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director .	651.311
the job also covers a number of other items .	116.82575
`` mom ' ' marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society .	647.3012
her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during may , which is national salvation army week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , mrs . marr ' s office is always open and the welcome mat is out .	337.98047
mrs . marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up .	1429.4835
she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures .	1275.9841
`` usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men ' ' , mrs . marr explained .	474.00015
the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center .	253.54323
`` and i bum tickets to everything i can ' ' , she said .	110.84716
`` i ' ve become the greatest beggar in the world ' ' .	136.74586

my husband and i , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from tucson , ariz . , to new york city	889.7943
i can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting .	3639.1584
i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations .	1640.5295
maybe motel-keeping isn ' t the nation ' s biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway .	142.24576
there are motels for all purposes and all tastes .	320.94638
there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock , tex . , as i discovered .	847.33563
there the royal motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free tv , storm cellar ' ' .	1794.6395
innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk ' ' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) .	1235.9457
some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children .	278.05002
but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar .	548.3218
motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated ' ' signs on farm houses and village homes before world war 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business .	686.96954
at the boxwood motel in winchester , va . , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels .	2551.7542

the baltimore and ohio railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12 01 a . m . next saturday .	542.2697
the current monthly payroll comes to about $15 , 000 , 000 .	188.05634
howard e . simpson , the railroad ' s president , said , `` a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action ' ' .	595.98694
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b . & o . operates .	136.36488
it will be accomplished in two ways 1	421.1276
a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions .	392.24127
there are about 3 , 325 officers and employees in this class .	445.94977
sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense .	337.6591
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a b . & o . spokesman said .	441.90482
those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages .	149.13426
the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job .	539.4503
a thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at franklin and mount streets .	1105.0824
the victim , norman b . wiley , 38 , of the 900 block north charles street , was treated for cuts at franklin square hospital after the robbery .	788.91986
the driver told police he followed as the negro man got out of the cab with his money .	266.43585
the victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit .	474.7414
he said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at pennsylvania avenue and gold street .	515.96356
in another attack , samuel verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block aiken street , told police two negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him .	2646.1685
a baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room anne arundel county home .	1536.8535
the victim darnell somerville , negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at anne arundel general hospital in annapolis .	929.01465
his sister and brother , marie louise , 3 , and john raymond , jr . 22 months , were admitted to the hospital .	318.62238
the girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body .	667.1975
the boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back .	220.95714
his condition was reported to be fair .	116.246284
police said the children ' s mother , mrs . eleanor somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred .	370.3236
the house is on old annapolis road a mile south of severna park , at jones station , police said .	1876.8545
-- the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what .	762.6821
the proposal was made by dr . david s . jenkins after he and mrs . d . ellwood williams , jr . , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week ' s meeting .	344.49258
the disagreement was over what dr . jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting .	288.31317
mrs . williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr . jenkins ' s conversation and how they were written up for the board ' s approval .	315.23633
`` i hate to have these things come up again and again ' ' , dr . jenkins commented as he made his suggestion .	225.4815
`` these are the board ' s minutes .	90.49752
i ' ll write what you tell me to ' ' .	80.39296
for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago .	455.17493
it was about that time , a board member said later , that dr . thomas g . pullen , jr . , state superintendent of schools , told dr . jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him .	242.12907
the board of county commissioners , the sanitary commission , the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings .	755.40753
dr . jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the state do not do so .	87.6994
state senator joseph a . bertorelli ( d . , first baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of west pratt street .	505.14685
he was taken to university hospital in a municipal ambulance .	718.92554
doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side .	651.0353
his condition was said to be , `` fair ' ' .	70.13878
police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 west pratt street .	1878.5325
he called vincent l . piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance .	368.46408
the vice president of the city council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies ' ' in the city ' s snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible .	225.77026
councilman william d . schaefer ( d . , fifth ) said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month .	1043.1217
conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm , mr . schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here .	414.6803
he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december .	653.1313
equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall ' ' , mr . schaefer said .	286.2671
the councilman , who is the administration floor leader , also criticized bernard l . werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations ' ' on tuesday night after the sunday storm .	828.26074
mr . werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week .	519.79407
what he did , mr . werner said , was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest .	1193.0963
work resumed wednesday , he said .	29.037788
mr . schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced ' ' .	771.3295
admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive ' ' .	743.04486
recounting personal observations of clearance work , the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes .	1916.4995
annapolis , jan . 7 ( special )	39.00553
-- the 15-year-old adopted son of a washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their chesapeake bay-front home , has been sent to spring grove state hospital for detention .	1231.5734
the victims were h . malone dresbach , 47 , and his wife , shirley , 46 .	667.91565
each had been shot in the back several times with a	197.89072
automatic rifle , according to capt . elmer hagner , chief of anne arundel detectives .	3690.1055
judge benjamin michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the anne arundel county jail .	901.0796
the circuit court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in juvenile court .	401.76782
soon after 10 a . m . , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the franklin manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the dresbach ' s other son , lee , 14 , they found mrs . dresbach ' s body on the first-floor bedroom floor .	383.47742
her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said .	274.69638
the younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother ' s car .	393.11365
the description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout southern maryland on police radio .	2049.3892
police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the dresbachs .	925.5402
trooper j . a . grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a route 2 service station , just outside annapolis .	891.6896
the driver admitted he was the dresbachs ' son and all three were taken to the edgewater station , police said .	664.95013
-- governor tawes today appointed lloyd l . simpkins , his administrative assistant , as maryland ' s secretary of state .	308.16537
mr . simpkins will move into the post being vacated by thomas b . finan , earlier named attorney general to succeed c . ferdinand sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the maryland court of appeals .	1158.6235
governor tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next friday .	1365.8281
mr . simpkins is a resident of somerset county , and he and the governor , also a somerset countian , have been friends since mr . simpkins was a child .	482.29593
now 38 , mr . simpkins was graduated from the university of maryland ' s college of agriculture in 1947 .	141.25568
five years later , he was awarded the university ' s degree in law .	138.76286
mr . simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the house of delegates from 1951 through 1958 .	216.64594
from the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the house of delegates .	232.7831
maryland contracts for future construction during october totaled $77 , 389 , 000 , up to 10 per cent compared to october , 1960 , f . w . dodge , dodge corporation , reported .	635.14246
nonresidential at $20 , 447 , 000 , down 28 per cent	196.1673
residential at $47 , 101 , 000 , up 100 per cent	363.95505
and heavy engineering at $9 , 841 , 000 , down 45 per cent .	374.71744
the cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634 , 517 , 000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year .	353.85522
nonresidential at $253 , 355 , 000 , up 22 per cent	217.16733
residential at $278 , 877 , 000 , up 12 per cent	236.36298
and heavy engineering at $102 , 285 , 000 , down 33 per cent .	473.97327
residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter .	704.6657
the share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time .	492.93274
in 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction .	406.0179
while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field .	720.3778
although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , leo j . pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .	733.0443
`` convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today .	314.62186
trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 ' ' , pantas predicted .	562.03143
sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit harbor view apartments in the cherry hill section .	2107.1907

various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct .	370.92926
others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies .	1303.945
the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction .	1266.6558
heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems .	3410.7693
construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by johns-manville corporation .	236.5991
-- vital secrets of britain ' s first atomic submarine , the dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire united states navy ' s still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a london-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today .	1149.4365
the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in 1959 and was launched last year .	277.8801
it is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs .	967.6365
it has a hull patterned on that of the united states navy ' s nautilus , the world ' s first atomic submarine .	245.54669
its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack .	437.63077
the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow st . police court here at the end of a three day hearing .	498.56232
a full trial was ordered for	667.79333
two british civil servants , miss ethel gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , harry houghton , 55 , and divorced .	1075.6957
they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard .	12445.985
gordon a . lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport .	1234.246
when arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in christmas gift wrapping , it was testified .	2282.7708
a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger , bookseller , and wife , joyce .	2340.766
( in washington , the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen , an american couple formerly of new york city )	1360.4346
in their suburban cottage the crown charges , the krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books .	1155.6434
each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript .	771.6194
only miss gee asked for bail .	1527.0154
her young british lawyer , james dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop .	1200.49
`` i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them ' ' , said the magistrate , k . j . p . baraclough .	255.89162
the trial will be held , probably the first week of march , in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs , the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison .	1268.3185
fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s .	1182.7142
fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior .	283.03925
he promptly went to communist east germany .	2917.7083
the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29 , 000 in american and british currency , mostly $20 bills , and in british government bonds and stocks .	455.2815
`` this is russian money ' ' , said mervin griffith-jones for the attorney general ' s office .	372.89276
he asserted that the krogers were the bankers for moscow , lonsdale the red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country ' s secrets .	785.9727
the fact that secrets of the dreadnought , and thereby of the american undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier .	410.82684
but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navy ' s chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , capt . george symonds .	1471.5735
he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon , jan . 7 .	568.1946
the information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .	114.034355
just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold .	963.7013
the british defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve .	282.74127
so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour .	513.18713
almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet .	1959.9518
britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed .	1872.7736
the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack .	850.8224
with the machinery went a complete design for the hull .	302.49774
the skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the nautilus and the other four which preceded it .	1160.5155
`` much of the navy ' s future depends upon her ' ' , an american naval announcement said on the skipjack ' s first arrival in british waters in august , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at portland underwater research station .	529.21844
it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work .	321.51834
`` her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent polaris missile submarines ' ' , the statement went on .	373.06244
the atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric corp . .	759.65686
thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said .	971.8244
the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work .	186.94348
it was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the albacore , in 1954 .	311.00204

the three -- miles j . cooperman , sheldon teller , and richard austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws .	1351.0531
in his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , bernard h . sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent ' ' .	285.24133
`` when they became members of the city police narcotics unit ' ' , sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket .	378.50302
they , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers ' ' .	592.4697
although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals ' ' .	1837.9569
this , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies ' ' and `` petty personal grievances ' ' .	329.71237
`` in the same five year period that the united states says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy ' ' , sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the lambert tree award and the mayor ' s medal ' ' .	603.16174

-- a jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old richard pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of mrs . anna hengesbach .	3248.2688
pohl received the verdict without visible emotion .	1212.7988
he returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last july , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , jack walker , or his guard .	716.6529
the verdict brought vindication to the dead woman ' s stepson , vincent hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in december , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict .	422.84055
mrs . hengesbach was killed on aug . 31 , 1958 .	263.3014
hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since .	772.5262
when the verdict came in against his young neighbor , hengesbach said	2399.7334
`` i am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed .	478.71567
still , i don ' t wish to appear happy at somebody else ' s misfortune ' ' .	118.61594
hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here .	624.7325
hengesbach has been living in grand ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 .	1342.4025
pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the westphalia area by state police .	1073.2559
he also admitted killing mrs . hengesbach .	137.88403
however , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial .	216.57198
assistant prosecutor fred lewis , who tried both the hengesbach and pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against pohl .	553.1304
circuit judge paul r . cash did not set a date for sentencing .	538.0777
pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation .	592.3587
walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure .	430.88455
a verdict against pohl came at 4 05 p . m . after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation .	497.54773
the jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of walker after the verdict was announced .	1019.59595
the jury foreman , mrs . olive heideman , of rural elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence .	651.4731
she said the jurors agreed that pohl ' s confession was valid .	567.8189
the jury asked judge cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter .	552.54834
the verdict came three hours later .	876.2358
some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read .	243.69078
the trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week .	643.89856
a sterling township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends .	391.78143
while neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother ' s duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit henry kowalski family , 34220 viceroy .	1717.2118
mrs . eleanor kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in holy cross hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , mrs . mary pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of warren .	707.23517

the mother and daughter , who will be buried side by side in mt . olivet cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the lyle elliott funeral home , 31730 mound , warren .	4305.1284
mrs . pankowski , 61 , remained in holy cross hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while mrs . kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother ' s small upstairs flat at 2274 eight mile road east .	1186.2573
assistant fire chief chester cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity .	1544.5529
christine ' s twin sister , patricia , and darlene kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns .	1981.8695
they are home now with the other kowalski children , vicky , 14	763.9578
`` all we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way mother wanted ' ' , kowalski said in telling his children of their mother ' s death yesterday afternoon .	299.82785
kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills .	3273.995
neighbor women , such as mrs . sidney baker , 2269 serra , sterling township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with kowalski ' s sister-in-law , mrs . anna kowalski , 22111 david , east detroit .	1394.1455
another neighbor , mrs . frank c . smith , 2731 pall mall , sterling township , surprised kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs .	2237.142
john c . houghton , president of the tareytown acres homeowners association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the kowalski family .	858.00305
houghton said 6 p . m . friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of dequindre and 14 mile road east .	493.09564

student council officers announced today the kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for fuhrmann ' s 770 students this friday night .	875.12256
`` furhmann ' s faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for vicky and sympathy for her entire family , pohly said .	1101.2734
there also were reports of a collection at the county line elementary school , 3505o dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the kowalski children including christine .	881.2573
kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last saturday .	285.54044
but today he wanted to make a public statement .	101.96791
`` i never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family .	534.6337
i wasn ' t sure there were such people anywhere in the world .	227.31848
i ' ll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them ' ' .	268.42377

a note making the request was handed to u . s . ambassador winthrop g . brown .	250.64732
the laos government said four major pathet lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from communist north viet nam .	2695.4902
the minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60 , 000 communist north vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near thakhek , in southern-central laos .	1232.0934
there was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources .	1913.2279
in the past such government claims have been found exaggerated .	844.7972

a havana radio broadcast identified the americans as howard anderson and august jack mcnair .	1889.2205
the executions took place at dawn only a few hours after havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at pinar del rio , where the executions took place .	1527.2281
the broadcast said anderson , a seattle ex-marine and havana businessman , and mcnair , of miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to cuban rebels .	1467.638
anderson operated three havana automobile service stations and was commander of the havana american legion post before it disbanded since the start of fidel castro ' s regime .	940.29065
anderson ' s wife and four children live in miami .	890.9513

emory university ' s board of trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state ' s tax laws made such a step possible .	359.2433
`` emory university ' s charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race ' ' , board chairman henry l . bowden stated .	553.5037
but an official statement adopted by the 33-man emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes .	2024.7135
the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated .	760.0975
`` emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions ' ' , the statement said .	611.0914
the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation .	1549.5853
an emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws .	189.23299
the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people ' ' .	693.5752
at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state .	631.61365
emory is affiliated with the methodist church .	226.77281
some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation .	718.831
the student newspaper , the emory wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation .	404.0223
`` from its beginning ' ' , the trustees ' statement said friday , `` emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning .	563.1707
teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under christian influence , are paramount in the emory university policy .	397.00476
`` as a private institution , supported by generous individuals , emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education .	1012.5716
`` there is not now , nor has there ever been in emory university ' s charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed .	943.40607
insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , emory university could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed .	771.55316
`` on the other hand , emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia .	782.6909
`` when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education ' ' .	569.747

the atlanta negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins ' ' if negotiations failed .	2397.9365
the demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the committee on appeal for human rights .	1173.0414
`` we intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year ' ' , the identically worded letters said .	431.32346
the letters set a nov . 15 deadline for the start of negotiations .	330.17868
they indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate .	1506.6683
downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted friday night for comment on the coahr request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the friday mail .	389.2291
however , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend .	244.3517
the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday .	762.3487
several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair .	309.928
student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago .	1332.8357
charles a . black , coahr chairman , said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on oct . 31 but had failed to show up .	419.90485
he declined to name the three .	137.56776
friday ' s letters asked for a nov . 15 meeting .	185.59094
failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference ' ' .	226.3775
black said coahr `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal ' '	648.0897
a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that `` extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits ' '	963.4335
besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and buckhead .	935.91626

-- for a second month in a row , multnomah county may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month ' s need , the state public welfare commission was told friday .	575.19037
it is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in ga category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary .	684.00684
william smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that multnomah , as of aug . 22 , had spent $58 , 918 out of its budgeted $66 , 000 in the category , leaving only $7 , 082 for the rest of the month .	814.53094
at the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17 , 000 .	249.40968
but it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , smythe said .	539.3467
no request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however .	728.2712
the commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , roy webster , of hood river , and dr . ennis keizer , of north bend , approved a year ' s contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past .	510.36612
the contract with ray field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month .	1326.3258
field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .	431.25745
acting administrator andrew f . juras said that because of field ' s unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period .	253.66429
but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past ' ' .	527.7194
he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave ' ' .	324.03326
juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government .	513.8912
he also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest ' ' in terms of the man ' s responsibility .	99.036125
the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added field ' s long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program .	651.709
`` do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract ' ' ? ?	179.92595
asked mrs . grace o . peck , representative from multnomah county , of the commission chairman , joseph e . harvey jr . .	474.10168
`` my feeling at the moment ' ' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him .	97.198105
the continued operation of this program depends on having his service ' ' .	159.54822
mrs . peck , later joined by the commission ' s vice-chairman , mrs . lee patterson , took harvey to task for comments he had made to the north portland rotary club tuesday .	974.4304
a publicity release from oregon physicians service , of which harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to salem , instead of `` crippling ' ' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between f & a and the commission staff .	755.208
`` i rather resent ' ' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in portland as though just the move accomplished this .	562.9836
i think you fell short of the real truth in the matter that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people .	169.92673
the staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles ' ' .	521.5176
harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare ' ' .	178.24301

one of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal .	2401.7012
a mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict .	156.69284
the arrest of mr . parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case .	612.07764
the first incident occurred before the trial got under way when judge h . hobart grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts .	2095.212
he asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case .	276.60886
two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial .	1611.0465
neither was seated on the jury .	49.4882
then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened .	671.7942
the juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient .	1328.8568
the judge replaced the juror with an alternate .	2324.0212
no formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents .	240.83769

vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom ' ' are endangering crops and wildlife , carl w . buchheister , president of the national audubon society , said today .	494.71854
`` it is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play ' ' , he commented .	604.1004
buchheister told delegates to the west coast audubon convention that aerial spraying in louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant .	1326.1875
`` but it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop ' ' , he said .	703.8557
the conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in ohio and wyoming .	1790.0039
there have even been serious errors in the u . s . forest service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added .	225.4084
`` the news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries ' ' , buchheister told the delegates .	866.45447
in addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , buchheister called for support of the wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including point reyes	3564.1313
preservation of the wetlands where birds breed	6725.4937
stronger water pollution control programs , and federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil .	516.57947

buchheister pledged the land would be an `` inviolate ' ' sanctuary for all birds , animals and plants .	283.93533
seventeen years ago today , german scientist willy fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a v-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a heinkel bomber .	5236.966
the world war 2 , german bomber rolled down a runway and took off .	1205.5282
the only way fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip .	705.3771
this had never been done before .	421.6826
now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for lockheed ' s missiles and space division at sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the navy ' s polaris missile .	581.34424
he sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 .	1283.4005
`` the first two pilots had crashed ' ' , he said .	130.68506
`` i had developed the machines and therefore knew them .	415.96558
it was time to go up myself ' ' .	55.199684
fiedler was then technical director of hitler ' s super-secret `` reichenberg project ' ' , which remained unknown to the allies until after the war .	311.30576
about 200 of the special v-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead .	3312.6826
the target was allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe .	1598.2363
the success of the project depended upon fiedler ' s flight .	706.0397
squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket ' s automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude .	1710.8931
at 12 , 000 feet , fiedler signaled `` release ' ' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the heinkel .	1826.1696
to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m . p . h . .	647.0599
it was probably man ' s first successful flight in a missile .	201.7296
`` she flew beautifully ' ' , said fiedler .	81.80204
`` there was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow .	841.18835
i had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip ' ' .	164.4854
using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket ' s tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage .	2104.9163
he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m . p . h . -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield .	546.943
moments later the v-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed .	1190.757
fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles .	3515.3723
the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb .	652.38025
pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships .	1090.7505
a crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into allied hands .	405.65488
now a family man with three children , fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale .	696.33954
his spare time is spent in soaring gliders .	43570.457
`` it ' s so quiet ' ' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging ' ' .	288.45645

members of the san francisco american friends service , a quaker organization , will march to san francisco for a rally in union square at 2 p . m . saturday .	438.37805
in a letter to the american friends service , dr . schweitzer wrote	706.9951
`` leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out .	667.3111
`` they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack .	1350.9983
the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons	507.32736
`` governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger	992.9043
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency ' ' .	617.42084
a federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant ' ' and operator of a janitors ' service .	698.80865
before he testified for 20 minutes , stein , who lives at 3300 lake shore dr . , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums .	1021.4641
among his gangland buddies , he said , were joseph ( joey ) glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , gus ( slim ) alex , ralph pierce , joe ( caesar ) divarco , and jimmy ( monk ) allegretti .	1822.4004
another hoodlum , louis arger , drew $39 , 000 from stein ' s janitor firm , the national maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , stein disclosed in an interview .	745.3216
`` i put arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at navy pier ' ' , stein said .	889.58606
`` but arger never was able to produce it , so i cut him off my payroll ' ' .	156.86096
other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including glimco and alex .	1864.3944
the federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing stein ' s fees as a labor consultant .	381.7435
under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to stein ' s national maintenance company at 543 madison st . .	508.65356
the company supplies janitors and workmen for mccormick place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses .	848.11053
among the witnesses were ed j . lee , director of mccormick place	595.4619
jerome leavitt , a partner in the union liquor company , 3247 s . kedzie av . , dominic senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of stein and a cousin of tony accardo , onetime gang chief	3610.4006
and frank w . pesce , operator of a glimco dominated deodorant firm , the best sanitation and supply company , 1215 blue island av . .	2025.4357
lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in april with stein to supply and supervise janitors in mccormick place .	636.1976
stein ' s fee , lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors ' pay .	168.22588
stein estimated this amount at `` about $1 , 500 or $1 , 600 a month ' ' .	260.61646
leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12 , 500 his liquor firm paid to stein for `` labor consultant work ' ' with five unions which organized leavitt ' s workers .	587.1383
leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman ' s local , the teamsters union , a salesman ' s union , the janitors ' union , and a bottling workers ' union .	693.15265
government attorneys , leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans ' ' totaling about $40 , 000 which the liquor company made to stein in the last year .	599.8782
all of the loans , in amounts up to $5 , 000 each , have been repaid by stein , according to leavitt .	696.21936
stein said he needed the money , leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll ' ' at national maintenance company .	252.86458
the deodorant firm run by pesce has offices in the headquarters of glimco ' s discredited taxi drivers ' union at 1213-15 blue island av . .	1802.0836
the radiation station of the chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over chicago yesterday .	1334.0222
the reading , which has been watched with interest since russia ' s detonation of a super bomb monday , was 4 on tuesday and 7 last saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health .	365.4522
the weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week .	2968.5535
a board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation .	305.8356
curtis allen huff , 41 , of 1630 lake av . , wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the first federal savings and loan association , 1 s . dearborn st . , where he formerly was employed as an attorney .	1229.389
federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20 , 000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10 , 000 .	2213.7468
huff ' s attorney , antone f . gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic ' s liens on property on which the association held mortgages .	813.5768
huff told gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living ' ' .	167.0568
huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from october of 1955 until september of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative .	701.83685
huff lives with his wife , sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25 , 000 home with a $17 , 000 mortgage .	440.54102
the complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by leo blaber , an attorney for the association .	600.21265
the shortage was discovered after huff failed to report for work on sept . 18 .	238.7967
on that date , according to gregorio , huff left his home and took a room in the new lawrence hotel at 1020 lawrence av . .	752.46967
there , gregorio said , huff wrote a complete statement of his offense .	477.50394
later , huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the sherman house , using a credit card .	790.9264
when huff attempted to cash another $100 check there monday , hotel officials called police .	4429.284

-- greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay $28 , 700 , 000 to greek victims of nazi persecution , it was announced today .	722.4494
probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week .	410.05435
for many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous .	583.5806
it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock	490.2981
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell .	452.15005
investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many .	668.96295
in fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares .	224.41273
some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers .	227.73239
a measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began .	377.0538
the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12 . 50 a share .	368.91205
the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler , guerin & turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share .	5490.696
and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around $22 a share .	1782.9973
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market .	272.89523
indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up .	885.6477
letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185 , 000 to the public at $12 . 50 , with another 5 , 000 reserved for morton foods employes at $11 . 50 a share ) .	426.93857
there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering .	853.1547
`` we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas .	3563.4514
cable confirmation ' ' , it said translated .	89.4867
but e . g . t . could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares .	231.06673
after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone .	1561.2855
but the result of it all was , e . g . t . partner dean guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation .	303.95465
`` i feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' ' ' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country .	289.91425
he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do .	521.5964
but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one ? ?	806.5157
the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances .	107.36352
first , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up .	976.94086
as a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) .	839.5967
second , the `` potato chip industry ' ' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- frito and h . w . lay -- on the market .	1245.2296
both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast run-up .	1426.8046
and third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth ' ' industry in the public mind of late .	267.09274
foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant ' ' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios .	1495.54
the potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger .	473.47565
the history of the u . s . potato chip industry is that many of today ' s successful companies got started during the deep depression days .	333.18765
those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest .	483.07227
but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms .	952.0493
so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito .	2444.6348
all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is .	305.17673
now , if morton ' s newest product , a corn chip known as chip-o ' s , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to .	674.1123

new car sales in dallas county during march showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year .	1831.1232
registrations of new cars in dallas county cracked the 3 , 000 mark in march for the first time this year .	501.37787
totaling 3 , 399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over february ' s 2 , 963 .	362.04688
however , compared with march 1960 new car sales of 4 , 441 , this march was off 23 per cent .	705.06903

this year-to-year decline for dallas county closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the u . s . for first three months of 1961 were about 1 , 212 , 000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier .	306.15253
with the march pickup , dealers are optimistic that the april-june quarter will equal or top last year .	1329.58

the kennedy administration ' s new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the federal housing administration , came under fire in dallas last week .	388.45108
the administration ' s proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated caron s . stallard , first vice-president of the mortgage bankers association of america .	822.50586
-- `` the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn ' ' , beryl w . sprinkel , economist of harris trust & savings bank , chicago , predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn . , california group , conference .	1246.7708
another speaker , william h . draper , jr . , former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper , gaither & anderson , urged the u . s . to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we won ' t be pushed around any more ' ' .	490.0856
he urged support for president kennedy ' s requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations .	290.56845
sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan ' ' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern .	583.0285
`` in view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial ' ' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 ' ' .	278.53995
sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence ' ' .	940.68396
rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth ' ' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery ' ' .	319.6674
he cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation ' ' .	302.4667
the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 ' ' .	478.05072
the unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike .	909.8091
draper declared , `` as i see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today .	606.7367
we must be ready for any needed sacrifice ' ' .	154.91014
he said that from his experience of two years with gen . clay in west berlin administration , that `` russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we ' re not acting as we should and must ' ' .	296.3103
he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can ' t buy yourself out and that ' s what we ' re trying to do ' ' .	336.27982
while he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro , `` for unless we do we ' re liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere .	384.47455
its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i don ' t believe we can permit that ' ' .	122.44857
-- stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of monday ' s losses in the associated press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks .	593.803
analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level ' ' represented by around 675 in the dow jones industrial average .	1172.1462
it was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages .	872.82214

a $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here tuesday by peter g . peterson , head of one of the world ' s greatest camera firms , in a key address before the american marketing assn . .	1051.4329
however , peterson , president of bell & howell , warned 800 u . s . marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom ' ' .	593.4158
`` as we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed ' ' , peterson said .	540.90485
`` with this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically ' ' .	1256.8975
the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs .	457.07474
peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas .	631.6658
he cited , as an example , how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology .	590.6593
he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market .	567.2368

-- alfred hayes , president of the federal reserve bank of new york , said tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms ' ' which would basically alter the international financial system .	459.62576

-- new york central railroad president alfred e . perlman said tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the chesapeake & ohio and baltimore & ohio railroads merge .	1211.2534
perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect .	229.72972
the railroad president made the statement in an interview as the interstate commerce commission opened round 2 of its hearing into the c & o ' s request to control and then merge with the b & aj .	431.9992
`` all these kind of things weaken us ' ' , perlman said .	782.0388
board chairman howard simpson of the baltimore & ohio railroad co . , testified the b & o was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the chesapeake & ohio railroad .	594.99994
`` the financial situation of the baltimore & ohio , has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s ' ' , he told the hearing .	253.22246

-- `` consumer uncertain about economic conditions ' ' .	75.92027
this was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the national housing center .	3142.912
other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify ' ' .	945.0337
the poll was taken at the center ' s annual builders ' intentions conference .	219.13512
expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 .	368.09833
look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960 ' s 1 , 257 , 700 non-farm housing starts .	1587.7034
the industry has said 1960 was a poor year .	412.13593
starts were down 20 percent from 1959 .	403.21225
why the discrepancy between the builders ' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ?	255.21617
the reason , says the housing center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders ' ' .	604.91125
-- farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales `` we ' ve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for 10 more .	1116.4988
we sold only four pickers all last year ' ' .	262.3078
gus ehlers , competitor of mr . houtz in this farm community , says his business since august 1 is running 50% above a year earlier .	540.84784
`` before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% ' ' , he says .	496.27417
though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas .	1198.3132
paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output .	1569.1161
although the administration ' s program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines .	1188.7426
fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently .	1231.7421
the higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery .	566.0504
seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year .	1208.5563
`` in august our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were 14% higher than last year ' ' , says mark v . keeler , farm equipment vice president of international harvester co . .	992.94403
for the year to date , sales of the company ' s farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 .	1091.5092
among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% .	861.05273
not all sections are showing an upswing , however	1557.1636
the drought-seared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend .	918.8838
the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry .	1547.1711
the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally .	1059.41
farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products .	589.8355
more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation ' s trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products .	736.77924
farmers are so eager for new machinery that they ' re haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report .	495.34076
`` farmers aren ' t as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale ' ' , says jack martin , who sells j . i . case tractors and implements in sioux city , iowa .	491.92752
`` this morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2 , 700 model .	2556.4614
last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine ' ' .	280.16998
mr . martin sold 21 tractors in august	2709.3274
in august of 1960 , he sold seven .	244.4441
with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country ' s farm equipment manufacturers .	587.7243
for example , farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about 5% above a year earlier , mr . keeler reports .	931.4641
tractor production at massey-ferguson , ltd . , of toronto in july and august rose to 2 , 418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says john staiger , vice president .	649.1233
with the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements .	1436.8046
merritt d . hill , ford motor co . vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers .	1615.5176
except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 .	1818.0103
the rise in sales last winter was checked when the government ' s new feed grain program was adopted	677.80585
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines .	1214.3236
nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects .	1537.4458
total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the july 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 .	1082.8812
the government also is aiding farmers ' income prospects .	7349.003
agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers $1 . 4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1 . 1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 .	759.88806
price support loans may total another $1 billion this year .	1032.888
with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers ' gross income is estimated at $39 . 5 billion , $1 . 5 billion above 1960 ' s record high .	1122.3805
net income may reach $12 . 7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 .	358.51086
the government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-september for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-july .	1507.3546
kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling .	1472.6088
the supreme court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined .	1242.4952
the company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products .	1065.8665
such `` depletion allowances ' ' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets .	567.2358
the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products .	356.47687
a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the ruling ' s impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products .	2804.841
the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone .	541.8388
president kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception .	1402.8854
`` my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries ' ' , the president said .	286.1235
charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the i . r . s . .	199.27007
the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution .	696.3638
requests for substantiation , the service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show .	652.1426
in such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received .	237.59073
a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested .	2713.445
a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax , under federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation .	533.1063
louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale .	358.61072
the corporation , in filing its final federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under u . s . tax law .	415.00293
the revenue service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income .	864.6306
the tax court rejected this view .	239.79135
it said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations .	882.39264
the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a year-old i . r . s . ruling on the subject .	866.17267

the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back ' ' to the company ' s advertising manager , the tax court ruled .	450.38794
the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager .	443.73465
the court upheld the taxpayer ' s contention that these `` kickbacks ' ' were not his income though they passed through his hands .	646.7893
the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting `` it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction ' ' .	293.23953
a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel .	714.8509
the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal manufacturers ' excise tax on household-type appliances .	931.00714
hiring the wife for one ' s company may win her tax-aided retirement income .	1733.7402
a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company ' s pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage .	893.74347
she would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company ' s contributions would be tax-free .	213.4131
a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income .	808.1475
in that event , they note , the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law .	875.0399
possible upshots the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made .	465.5824
state briefs voters in four counties containing and bordering denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area .	1828.4795
colorado has a 2% sales tax .	542.6018
denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax .	440.74274
the washington state supreme court ruled that the state ' s occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent .	659.2641
the state ' s occupation tax is computed on gross sales .	1720.926
the court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities .	1470.3418
-- consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months , the government reported .	446.5026
the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in april , down 1% from the march level of more than $18 . 2 billion .	1727.5378
april sales also were 5% below those of april last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18 . 9 billion ( see chart on page one ) .	700.1765
the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-easter buying was pushed into march .	871.1693
commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march .	668.18225
adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2 . 5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the january low of $17 . 8 billion .	486.0721

last october he gave a public speech in washington , d . c . entitled `` are women here to stay ' ' ? ?	91.989876
so you can see that gerald g . ramsey , director of smu ' s food services , is not the ordinary type of craven , women-trodden chef .	930.4928
he is apt to rear back and claim his rights .	663.4444
ramsey , as smu ' s food wrangler , buys enough groceries to serve 32 , 000 meals a week .	1270.328
tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman ' s burden ! !	309.10254

dip in melted butter and roll in flour .	1390.0272
place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan .	3908.2031

contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability .	2575.565
that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month .	620.4853
though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the ' 20 ' s and ' 40 ' s , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary .	1479.5676
these two , heritage and drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone .	574.33777
the heritage collection , to be shown by sanger-harris and anderson ' s studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time .	726.34326
called perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces .	1173.911
walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors .	1953.2352
it is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality .	1355.964
the drexel collection , called composite , to be shown by titche ' s offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs .	579.35895
rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia .	19013.352
a high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest .	21047.146
an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard .	1097.7931
the other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror .	9838.556
colorful , bright eastman chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite .	3902.3708
the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles .	906.14716
design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexel ' s fall 1961 group , composite .	2159.5688
the spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top .	772.27386
see-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor .	10532.665
to bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics .	686.9735
dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today ' s design , with substance and maturity , keynote the perennian collection from heritage .	553.4826
center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases .	544.2294
mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile .	4307.868
the vagabonds are `` on the road ' ' again .	628.1171

she dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest .	697.4817
the second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist .	1954.8005

guests from across u . s . honor dr . swim	84.51836
when dr . w . a . swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the wilshire country club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country .	915.3429
a flight originating in florida picked up guests on the east coast and midwest and a plane left from seattle taking on passengers at west coast points .	1556.028
cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known dr . swim when he practiced in los angeles .	618.0857
he started practice in 1917 , and served on the state board of medical examiners .	538.19446
giving up the violin opened a whole new career for ilona schmidl-seeberg , a tiny hungarian who fritz kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage .	2155.9553
a heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing .	1383.1656
she put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in budapest .	1535.0402
now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in los angeles .	224.92987
her days as an art student at the university of budapest came to a sudden end during the hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband stephen fled to vienna .	987.9657
there they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture .	235.35394
and there she had her first showing of tapestry work .	1145.5177
there ' s a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today .	192.22609
what most people don ' t seem to realize , if they aren ' t tied up with the thing as i am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation .	98.91648
i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school .	651.37836
it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school .	776.42554
getting to and from school was no problem .	260.89932
they either walked or were driven .	611.0628
now they go to a high school that is two miles away .	409.9488
one might think the problem would be similar .	166.30554
they could walk , ride on a bus or be driven .	710.6806
it ' s much more complex than that .	307.5462
generally , they go to school with a girl named gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car .	318.43372
this is a way of getting to school , but , i understand , it entails a certain loss of social status .	369.6271
a young man doesn ' t like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn ' t even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl .	137.1684
`` why don ' t you walk to school then ' ' ? ?	65.72348
`` my father walked , through two miles of snow , in illinois ' ' .	113.32398
`` no ' ' , i said , `` i didn ' t happen to grow up in illinois ' ' .	41.414467
i explained , however , that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom .	445.5198
i had to ride a streetcar two miles .	469.8105
sometimes there weren ' t even any seats .	182.51118
i had to stand up , with the ladies .	115.04558
sometimes i got on the wrong car and didn ' t get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there .	232.1652
i ' ve tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then .	841.09375
when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car .	230.30377
she has to have at least one car herself .	1172.6913
i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman .	285.3624
if they have to take any car , they ' d rather take the big one .	207.18684
they say that when they take a car , gloriana doesn ' t take her car , but rides with them .	291.19415
but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn ' t big enough .	267.2196
the logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself .	341.15256
the solution , naturally , is the bus .	122.43076
however , it ' s a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it ' s too hard on my legs .	281.38766
my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there .	358.34116
nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman , and he ' s already got an education .	649.58746
advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the new york social register which made news last week .	533.49335
published annually by william hord richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled society register of southern california , is scheduled to arrive with monday morning ' s postman .	1182.668
publisher richardson has updated the blue book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages ' ' .	789.9408
stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year .	1118.234
last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of meredith jane cooper , daughter of the grant b . coopers , to robert knox worrell , and of mary alice ghormley to willard pen tudor .	2112.5432
others are carla ruth craig to dan mcfarland chandler jr .	8227.182
joanne curry , daughter of the ellsworth currys , to james hartley gregg , and valerie smith to james mcalister duque .	6705.998
also noted are the marriages of elizabeth browning , daughter of the george l . brownings , to austin c . smith jr .	712.2194
cynthia flower , daughter of the ludlow flowers jr . , to todd huntington , son of the david huntingtons .	905.0218
listed as newly wed in the pasadena section of the new book are mr . and mrs . samuel moody haskins 3 .	258.31915
she is the former judy chapman , daughter of john s . chapman of this city .	257.22977
the young couple live in pasadena .	1719.0618
another marriage of note is that of jane mcalester and william louis pfau .	10677.257
for instance , the edwin pauleys jr . , formerly of chantilly rd . , are now at home on north arden dr . in beverly hills .	1207.7705
mr . and mrs . robert moulton now live on wilshire and the franklin moultons on s . windsor blvd . .	2738.365
the richard beesemyers , formerly of connecticut , have returned to southern california and are now residing on south arden blvd . .	1371.7749
but the raoul esnards have exchanged their residence in southern california for mexico city .	3066.636
judge and mrs . julian hazard are now at laguna beach , while the frank wangemans have moved from beverly hills to new york , where he is general manager of the waldorf-astoria hotel .	1529.5558
and lawrence chase , son of the ransom chases , is listed at his new address in oxford , eng . .	695.0216
others listed at new addresses are the richard t . olerichs , the joseph aderholds jr . , the henri de la chapelles , the john berteros and dr . and mrs . egerton crispin , the john armisteads , the allen chases , the howard lockies , the thomas lockies , and anthony longinotti .	1087.7599
newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the ray carbones , formerly of panama	1050.0695
the geddes macgregors , formerly of scotland , and mr . and mrs . werner h . althaus , formerly of switzerland .	486.04477
here ' s an idea for a child ' s room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases .	540.8025
most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes .	927.3037
displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent .	1333.006
to create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop .	1678.5769
measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet ' s head .	378.67233
make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` l ' ' , the foot of the `` l ' ' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light .	328.90353
using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base .	1350.3518
in this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal .	547.41425
if the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child ' s whims .	473.38034
although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child ' s playtime .	645.1116
those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round .	1182.4103
the scalloped edge is particularly appealing .	1482.4426
today ' s trend toward furniture designs from america ' s past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era .	1706.3916
a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions .	2311.559
in the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch .	411.64966
so junior ' s bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks ' ' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only .	651.2246
this isn ' t true of the many homemakers of the 1960 ' s , according to decorator consultant , leland alden .	880.65784
housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says mr . alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical ' ' .	667.8739
there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop `` down to earth ' ' designs -- or go out of business .	301.06534
hotel escape ' s bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` kings 4 , plus two ' ' .	1170.6292
this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch .	2044.3091
show spotlights the kings -- george worth , bill kay , frank ciciulla and gene wilson , flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens .	3661.2983
the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid .	1073.1316
in the comedy division , the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props .	1565.1295
net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick .	1917.708
kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs .	1659.176
if they can ' t chalk up big business here then let ' s stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing ,	1133.6495
andy bartha and his trio have booked into oceania lounge .	10215.806

is there anything a frustrated individual can do about communism ' s growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ?	396.67188
more than 300 teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from 4 to 8 p . m . sunday at first presbyterian church .	478.62802
at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged .	612.25836
a young real estate salesman , kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force .	968.5597
he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing .	1185.6273
kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it .	258.65305
when he attended the christian anti-communist crusade school here about six months ago , jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it .	842.92377
the best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church .	1069.3134
and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a biblically strong christianity .	1023.65045
so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program .	5895.271
this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation	852.6605
a review of the philosophy of communist leaders by ted slack , another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the university of miami	1004.1471
and talks on how their christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting communism during high school and college days , by ted place , director of greater miami youth for christ , and jon braun , director of campus crusade for christ .	898.0491
the second half of the film `` communism on the map ' ' and the movie `` operation abolition ' ' also will be shown .	235.36057
response to the program has been so encouraging , kern said , that a city-wide youth school at dade county auditorium may be set up soon .	1135.3915
and to encourage other churches to try their own programs , kern said this sunday ' s sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations .	424.39493
the need for and the way to achieve a christian home will be stressed in special services marking national christian family week in miami area churches next week .	979.8381

it will be the second time the assistant manager of a coral gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies .	1391.8
the first one , two years ago , changed the routine of their home life .	281.22897
`` when you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the christian faith , you strive a little harder to uphold those vows ' ' , explains the slender vice president of the young couples sunday school class .	553.59
until that first dedication service , he and lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home .	477.8351
they have five daughters -- coral lee , 5 , glenda rae , 4 , pamela , 3 , karen , 2 , and shari , five months .	1080.3009
but after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and bible stories .	303.98694
to their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part .	227.99129
even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her .	3894.9717

enrique jorda , conductor and musical director of the san francisco symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in europe before returning home to open the symphony ' s golden anniversary season , it was announced .	558.3593
the guest assignments are scheduled for november 14 and 18 , with the orchestra sinfonica siciliana in palermo and the orchestra of radio cologne .	1097.9768
the season in san francisco will open with a special gala concert on november 22 .	966.77124
during his five-month visit abroad , jorda recently conducted the orchestre philharmonique de bordeau in france , and the santa cecilia orchestra in rome .	1761.7987
in announcing jorda ' s return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the sherman clay box office on wednesday .	729.0321
guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists yehudi menuhin , isaac stern , ruggiero ricci and david abel	3993.3167
pianists leon fleisher , ruth slenczynka and stephen bishop and conductor earl bernard murray .	8623.903
the leningrad kirov ballet , which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house , is , i think , the finest `` classical ' ' ballet company i have ever seen , and the production of the petipa-tschaikowsky `` sleeping beauty ' ' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing .	262.662
this work is no favorite of mine .	537.89246
i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect	2085.5947
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was	930.6086
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people	675.2016
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms .	15775.299
all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirov ' s utterly captivating presentation .	1127.849
the reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova ' ' , `` eva ' ' , or `` aya ' ' .	357.18076
in other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet .	3063.5173
it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- miss omsk , miss pinsk , miss stalingr oops , skip it .	1941.3221
these qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company ' s collective personality .	379.21695
it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet .	568.0567
oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the kirov .	1324.9542
this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics .	1414.5782
but , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned .	344.95383
irina kolpakova , the princess aurora of friday ' s performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before .	267.81815
she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable .	2014.3114
alla sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the east , was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner , yuri soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky .	891.4523
vladilen semenov , a fine `` danseur noble ' '	803.20856
konstantin shatilov , a great character dancer	7411.538
and inna zubkovskaya , an excellent lilac fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent .	479.73755
the production , designed by simon virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way .	654.86237
it was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery .	895.14105
evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , guy lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity .	1718.2964
mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the san francisco chamber music society .	531.0631
the season will open at the new hall of flowers in golden gate park on november 20 at 8 30 p . m . with a concert by the mills chamber players .	319.3651
sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season	10821.379
annual members may attend for $16 .	3006.4675
participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in the chronicle ) .	902.63635
mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 chestnut street , san francisco 9 .	1073.1274
san francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children .	1033.0043
fire fighters local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for san franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen .	1798.8856
toys will not be collected at firehouses this year .	2264.423
they will be accepted at all branches of the bay view federal savings and loan association , at a collection center in the center of the stonestown mall , and at the junior museum , 16th street and roosevelt way .	517.3059
from the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution .	516.85297
any needy family living in san francisco can obtain toys by writing to christmas toys , 676 howard street , san francisco 5 , and listing the parent ' s name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 .	549.168
requests must be mailed in by december 5 .	298.7723
famed cellist pablo casals took his instrument to the east room of the white house yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal .	519.0109

for a good many seasons i ' ve been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies .	366.41977
after all , this year ' s movies are next year ' s television shows .	193.90305
so i went to see `` la dolce vita ' ' .	145.41307
it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality .	969.45654
all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film .	895.9875
if that ' s all the romans did , it ' s a surprise to me that rome fell .	308.47824
after television , `` la dolce vita ' ' seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night .	770.1604
i cannot imagine a single scene that isn ' t done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week .	510.33255
i believe tv watchers will be bored .	140.69887
`` la dolce vita ' ' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western .	542.13885
week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` the adventures of ozzie and harriet ' ' .	199.76144
there is more decadence on `` 77 sunset strip ' ' .	204.76494
there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series .	5627.1953
in another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns .	1476.7611
with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you ' ll find on the robert herridge theater .	1770.3868
most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party ' ' at a seaside villa .	278.25705
producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! !	1341.8828
the dolce vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip )	1533.86
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face	1653.044
a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies .	2106.0227
put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word i can think of dull .	2009.8673
apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall .	2362.6182
what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! !	430.2044
as a moral shocker it is a dud .	852.5443
but this doesn ' t detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film .	610.06244
the chronicle ' s paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly	32349.955
`` this is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories ' ' .	962.5858
and when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .	451.0

and you think you have language problems .	291.68027
the week went along briskly enough .	5589.8564
i bought a new little foreign bomb .	910.38025
it is very chic to drive foreign cars .	551.5122
with a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back .	241.88075
you must also wear a car coat .	372.5782
the wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive .	734.50226
but we couldn ' t really get along without it .	210.32756
`` where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha ' ' ? ?	359.62122
the present crop of small cars is enriching american humor .	3065.7588
gas station people are very debonair about small cars .	4538.5615
when i drove a car with tail fins , i had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases .	4084.3916
my car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth .	9025.8
this excellent foreign bomb takes only six .	1307.1019
when i had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me .	997.9284
check the oil and water , sir ? ?	193.19093
the man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank .	829.05096
`` what kind of car is it ' ' ? ?	46.954723
`` it is a british austin , the smallest they make ' ' .	192.68596
`` get much mileage ' ' ? ?	5.154325
the gas station man sighed unhappily .	8486.373
`` what i always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ?	1142.1263
crunch , that ' s all she wrote ' ' .	41.216393
`` i will die rich ' ' .	64.63232
`` that will be $1 . 80 ' ' , said the gas station man .	389.51205
`` the windshield looks pretty clean ' ' .	70.23912
ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! !	584.44775
when i wheeled about , finned fore and aft , i was the darling of the doormen .	984.96796
dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely .	4899.204
with a small bomb , i tuck it between cadillacs .	8294.27
( the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself .	1197.6187
high blood pressure can get the best of any of us .	66.51248
at last the white house is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master american craftsman , duncan phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u . s . presidents of the 19th century sent abroad for their furnishings .	713.2567
the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansion ' s library .	699.2703
the suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 ' s .	228.0808
the gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey , whose famous estate , `` tranquility ' ' , was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover , n . j . .	550.84784
authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago .	1264.1252
this acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs .	4365.4785
the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedy ' s fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home .	671.7574
it is the aid ' s intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of americana ' ' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall .	1057.3469
the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture .	10859.051
the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem , mass . , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in 1792 .	2073.3975
the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace .	2801.1255
it will be painted to match the paneling in the room .	257.1823
the aid committee ' s chairman in charge of the redecoration , mrs . henry francis lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project .	489.37057
mrs . lenygon ' s committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york , include mrs . allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j . jussel , both wellknown manhattan decorators .	2269.0652
regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e . barnes of boston .	281.42444
president kennedy couldn ' t stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people ' s concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the 85-piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard , n . c . .	896.7748
but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music .	350.37317
at 4 p . m . the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert .	615.49225
it was the first in the series of `` concerts for young people by young people ' ' to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house .	395.12277
she was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience .	265.0702
she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port , mass . , and in his welcoming remarks , the president said he was representing her .	385.46896
as he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion , the band struck up the `` star spangled banner ' ' and followed it with `` hail to the chief ' ' .	656.4077
`` i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band , and we are grateful to them ' ' , president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl .	911.3231
after paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , president kennedy said , `` as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music ' ' .	449.75076
he added `` i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field ' ' .	134.20645
displaying his knowledge of music , the new england-born president remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont , by young americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the united states .	429.3615
`` this is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as i do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the white house ' ' .	394.86703
as he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests .	762.123
he expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde patricia holbrook , 16 , of mount rainier , had attended the joseph p . kennedy school for the handicapped in boston .	1120.8584
`` the nuns there do a wonderful work ' ' , the president commented .	211.27374
patricia now attends the c . melvin sharpe health school in the district .	1586.9683
each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon .	1520.1478
they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff .	695.0481
many of the music-loving members of the president ' s staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience .	727.7057
and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected .	233.20894
henry hall wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the president ' s staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives , turned guest conductor for a sousa march , the `` stars and stripes forever ' ' .	469.73926
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs . kennedy ' s social secretary , letitia baldrige , told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring .	555.85956
he said he contacted a friend , henry hall wilson , on the president ' s staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series .	188.6895
a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student north carolina group to play the first concert .	2473.8699
one of the most interested `` students ' ' on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house , was letitia baldrige , social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy .	684.825
`` i was an art major in college ' ' , miss baldrige explained .	1454.4824
`` i ' ve been here so many times i couldn ' t count them ' ' .	100.12033
she turned out to be a fan , too , of margaret bouton , the gallery ' s associate curator of education .	631.7468
miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at 5 p . m . .	259.64496
the brevard group of 85 arrived at the gallery at 6 p . m . , remaining for about 45 minutes .	428.43527
the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later .	441.04593
they decided that they thought rembrandt ' s self-portrait made him look `` sad ' '	584.51746
they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphael ' s `` alba madonna ' ' and `` texture ' ' in a monet painting of rheims cathedral .	442.85406
everybody had heard of van gogh , the french impressionist .	1110.0621
gallery director john walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them .	536.9932
he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , richard bales .	393.14813
i ' m sure you ' ve heard of him and his record , ' the confederacy ' ' ' .	120.63586
along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the gallery ' s blue-uniformed guards .	923.16223
in 45 minutes , the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late 19th century .	681.4298
a few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art ' ' .	437.36102
among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were boucher , courbet , fra angelico .	3277.0437
the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallery ' s rotunda fountain `` because it ' s on the second floor ' ' .	185.65186
that imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st . nw . took on bustling life yesterday .	8117.679
more than 250 scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , albert pike , who headed the scottish rite from 1859 to 1891 .	825.0364
they came together in the huge , high-ceilinged council chamber to hear the late leader eulogized .	1967.7954
c . wheeler barnes of denver , head of the scottish rite in colorado , praised pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order .	659.66595
the ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of pike in the house of the temple .	372.27628
about 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the ancient and accepted scottish rite for the southern jurisdiction of the united states .	344.22772
the opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a . m . today .	137.55058
there will be a pilgrimage to mount vernon at 2 30 p . m . .	164.76047
a wreath will be placed at the tomb of george washington , one of this nation ' s first masons -- a past master of washington-alexandria lodge 22 in alexandria .	584.52527
the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years .	802.2034
john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous .	436.29144
he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife .	755.31134
hurt by his lack of interest and attention , mary complained often that he didn ' t help around the house , and that he didn ' t really care about the family .	112.654495
she accused him of ignoring her .	28629.604
he in turn told her she demanded too much .	897.9823
they were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable .	1903.8661
mary decided she had had enough .	166.43501
without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done .	149.11096
the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer .	883.35834
family service , sharing in ugf , has five agencies in the washington area .	494.97836
they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems .	435.8074
because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , mr . and mrs . black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia , the agency nearest them .	311.33514
for nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce .	335.4715
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other .	175.71892
they are now working together toward solving their difficulties .	1893.3408
john received a promotion in his firm .	87.44806
he gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life .	190.37163
mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children ' s bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing .	1115.0765
to outsiders , the blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a difference .	297.18277
they know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy family .	279.13876
family service has helped hundreds of families in this area .	463.2326
perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital .	495.9983
but to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured .	265.15515
family service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the united givers fund .	487.55215
anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze .	4011.2483
one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev .	936.04926
`` i ' m hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground ' ' .	726.68243
the president knew that a confrontation with mr . khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable .	858.2714
but he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting .	260.0355
he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u . s . and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy .	214.00996
last friday the white house announced	2965.3574
president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s . khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4 .	689.6491
the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relations .	746.78656
the heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the president ' s change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader .	119.83361
he was not going to vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned .	921.96967
but mr . kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr . khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe .	233.51205
that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting .	521.85767
despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war .	160.21568
the u . s . and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations ' ' .	486.20703
the first time was in 1955 when a full-dress big four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of geneva ' ' .	1044.1837
the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east .	1545.5673
in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u . s . .	156.59021
that meeting produced the `` spirit of camp david ' ' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement .	459.81863
on the third occasion -- another big four summit session at paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit ' ' .	530.9752
premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u . s . for the u-2 incident .	277.19867
the episode tended to confirm the u . s . belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the soviet leader ' s real aims in summitry .	490.60864
thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president , mr . kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem .	317.182
shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words	354.51578
`` as long as mr . khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations ' ' .	559.90405
the president had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the u . s . and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance .	286.46848
he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary .	5760.8657
he wanted time , too , to review the united states ' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating .	411.40753
above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev ' s doorstep .	324.33994
at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader .	664.9206
ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels .	264.98425
but mr . kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it .	1071.4054
it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe mr . khrushchev ' s intentions and to make clear his own views .	211.18007
moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u . s . was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions .	496.43106
both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e . thompson brought back to russia late in february .	736.46173
the letter , dated feb . 22 , was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk , siberia , on march 9 .	512.35364
it dealt mainly with a broad range of east-west issues .	481.5973
but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr . khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted .	287.9985
developments over the next two months , however , caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing .	174.24226
there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly .	586.6927
the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva .	857.8296
the deadlock has been caused by the russians ' new demand for a three-man ( east , west and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery .	539.83325
in the u . s . , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing .	276.5545
mr . kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament .	1022.44995
there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to communist china .	649.21985
the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent .	478.2322
moreover , moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the u . n . secretariat and the international control commission for laos .	342.76666
mr . kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible .	584.59467
developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting .	878.7107
initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting .	736.80524
at the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the west ' s ability and determination to resist communist pressure .	692.8526
in cuba , the u . s . had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep .	1056.2988
in laos , the picture was almost equally bad .	1030.9105
u . s . willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized ' ' on soviet terms .	450.51422
beyond that , allied disagreement about military intervention in laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces .	1198.1573
as a result , the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos , and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure .	458.89276
in the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself .	609.70624
ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leader ' s mood was cocky and aggressive .	426.18515
he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out .	324.40057
the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin , iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back .	727.50616
it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the u . s . embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future .	325.69662
mr . kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies .	637.97046
the response from london , paris and bonn was favorable .	438.2959
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week .	299.45792
apparently at the insistence of the u . s . , the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the `` informal ' ' nature of the meeting .	203.7005
`` the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries .	487.95126
the meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries ' ' .	398.14053
the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in mr . kennedy ' s own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident ' ' , and a 44-year-old president ( his birthday is may 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy .	474.21243
the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u . s . of both approval and disapproval .	159.77777
the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at vienna .	1163.451
the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations .	215.38629
but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary .	507.25525
mr . khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men .	1109.6812
the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr . kennedy would give him pause .	475.40833
apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the u . s . appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit .	210.95201
premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway .	894.0844
this time the initiative came , in part at least , from washington .	116.362305
there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr . khrushchev , the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders .	211.5216
thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity .	740.1343
finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president ' s making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord .	406.48825
there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world .	524.26324
if tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the u . s . make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union .	188.3867
disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .	302.34055
after cuba and laos , it was argued , mr . khrushchev will interpret the president ' s consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds .	261.18015
moreover , the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of america ' s firm foreign policy commitments .	361.93518
the question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the president would take if mr . khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east .	609.7952
there are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory .	1462.8799
mollusks are a case in point .	106.85874
the shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development .	681.64526
though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education .	561.7809
there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities .	532.28894
the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .	909.3129
by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence .	917.06464
there is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture .	784.73395
viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university .	949.9352
but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project	808.06006
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy .	309.26514
official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds .	519.9689
american catholics have responded generously to bishops ' and pastors ' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning .	623.957
they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made .	520.7482
diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility .	593.39197
all of this may be understandable enough it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise .	421.43695
yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities .	466.82397
community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible .	321.1647
to understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of american catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community .	236.5982
it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment .	1848.0201
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere .	1104.6688
the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension .	1937.2201
the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship .	1571.0905
american catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise ' ' -- the `` private enterprise ' ' of religious communities .	129.27943
had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees .	2709.2434
there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business ' ' .	379.19635
this `` family-community ' ' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement .	135.64871
it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas .	612.70105
i think for example of three women ' s colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university , which is also co-educational .	909.5137
this is not an isolated example	5754.4688
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough .	1010.19257
it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot .	4451.6353
apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business ' ' spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny .	466.42856
for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today ' s need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence ' ' .	430.5073
at the earlier `` pre-academic excellence ' ' stage of catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis .	837.91565
but with today ' s demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders ' ' becomes more pressing .	425.0454
the problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers ' ' are needed but that a different brand is called for .	374.93835
commenting on the earlier stage , the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee ' ' ( as opposed to , e . g . , `` maintenance employee ' ' ) was a not inapt description .	427.10126
today however , the `` outsider ' ' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university .	400.63452
and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement .	748.8701
in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it `` even with the best of intentions he ( the president of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities .	590.1939
it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' ' ' .	432.40912
the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns ' ' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside ' ' faculty .	407.89322
it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university ' ' this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension .	372.5423
but in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one .	234.00183
`` outside ' ' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business .	510.37247
there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university .	230.91011
in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel .	733.756
word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences .	871.15857
expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype .	1916.9062
in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere .	611.30383
to appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service .	334.17734
much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure .	687.3457
this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated .	470.07065
when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services .	357.02768
a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family ' ' .	303.84305
just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions .	481.03107
yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place .	778.63416
broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university .	317.57474
religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman ' s reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification .	640.30225
there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels .	287.8741
the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution .	359.86548
but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation .	569.2188
the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group ' ' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself .	476.56564
this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure .	1245.5651
yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order .	296.55328
the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority .	1106.6443
in the case of academic personnel the `` feeling ' ' of participation can hardly be `` faked ' ' .	254.69025
competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students ' illusion that they are making their own decisions .	741.41754
those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work ' ' and ersatz decision making .	800.26483
in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all .	671.53674
in the notre dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication ' ' .	326.31223
in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation ' ' the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i . e . , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements .	300.9514
sen . john l . mcclellan of arkansas and rep . david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws .	834.7126
once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally .	841.4162
or , in the words of anatole france , `` the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges ' ' .	610.53827
the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr . mcclellan ' s hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites .	729.5944
the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .	7567.8223
in addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill .	1189.4552
it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike .	550.7307
business week ( aug . 9 , 1961 ) reports that the united aircraft company , against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .	450.871
the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers .	1173.7744
the company has billed the united states government for $7 , 500 , 000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor ' s business .	396.7939
rep . frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee .	171.47627
neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter	1299.9426
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions .	1337.6344
the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained .	749.068
the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines	510.8482
it must play a game in which there never is a winner .	205.14815
the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law .	460.80396
hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy .	552.4269
let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which general electric , westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market .	915.3983
the industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied .	2881.4714
the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment .	439.43915
accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price .	674.8527
naturally , enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .	307.5896
should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry .	446.02762
uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition ' ' .	256.89978
but if they show self-restraint , they don ' t get the orders .	113.4062
under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted .	395.2515
engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants .	319.85812
the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that general electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows .	578.2776
in other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday , wednesday and friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday , thursday and saturday .	436.07947
and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday ? ?	567.77966
the question might be asked `` don ' t the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ?	434.27914
why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws ' ' ? ?	559.28314
the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold , in the folklore of capitalism , back in 1937 .	567.46356
he wrote `` ( p . 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure .	314.78015
( p . 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship .	1789.171
( p . 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control .	1354.6276
in this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws .	885.43744
( pp . 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government ' ' .	303.08408
this escape from control has led to management ' s evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while .	697.6803
a plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license .	566.65533
( the penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities .	1305.0778
if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest .	510.49756
a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle .	704.43024
however , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational .	700.63574
quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union .	483.31998
those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform .	1605.6595
before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english .	2093.1458
the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle .	1025.891
the wagner act , the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .	1298.6293
the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .	1067.0223
if a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud .	2330.041
the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession .	567.64594
the problem must be faced squarely .	1674.6746
if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them .	813.8822
human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century america .	1100.6923
as early as 1776 , adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations `` we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work	470.68365
but many against combining to raise it ' ' .	73.18722
eighteenth-century england , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies .	2057.5034
in 1825 , the boston house carpenters ' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared `` it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies ' ' .	732.1385
there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly .	2004.997
the courts shared the opinion of the employers .	113.37949
in people vs . fisher , justice savage of the new york supreme court declared	4172.646
`` without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it	304.22244
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means ' ' .	172.47304
compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin , according to the daily labor report of sept . 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment ' ' .	360.78314
senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .	588.7152
his bill , allegedly aimed at hoffa , would amend the sherman , clayton and norris-laguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international .	1015.39624
paradoxically , the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act .	480.9357
indeed , it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws	1204.6227
for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers .	2230.1426
at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates .	897.3236
the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies .	2926.3289
it was most effective against trade unions .	714.7544
in the famous danbury hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices , e . g . , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer .	515.397
the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .	543.6181
in 1914 , the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity .	994.254
the law could not suspend economics .	9748.167
labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws .	1279.8372
the courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act .	931.8217
in 1922 , the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company .	3593.8843
the company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union ' s activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce .	437.70465
( what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ?	567.77155
) the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce .	1193.1709
at a closed-door session on capitol hill last week , secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on u . s . affairs abroad .	362.90747
afterward , tennessee ' s democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen .	2148.6274
what herter presented , said gore , was `` not a very encouraging review ' ' .	239.62859
that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts .	620.6191
while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos , two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions .	1377.1564
hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery , dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the u . s . with a blunt and drastic demand within 48 hours , the u . s . had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 u . s . citizens , plus 120 cuban employees ) .	545.66534
president eisenhower held an 8 30 a . m . meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately .	582.59326
`` there is a limit to what the united states in self-respect can endure ' ' , said the president .	198.07245
`` that limit has now been reached ' ' .	51.95303
through secretary herter , ike offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision .	2175.2812
kennedy , through secretary-designate of state dean rusk , declined .	513.84094
he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan . 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the u . s . and latin america ( see the hemisphere ) .	236.59764
after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants , the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam .	1214.0579
`` in view of the present situation in laos ' ' , said the pentagon ' s announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific ' ' .	173.6382
cutting short a holiday at hong kong , the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines .	4688.154
on the u . s . ' s island base of okinawa , task force 116 , made up of army , navy , marine and air force units , got braced to move southward on signal .	687.6319
but by week ' s end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the u . s . was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-western -- government might be best for laos .	450.7951
there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts .	1489.4836
political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right .	549.60345
`` it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again ' ' , said one military man .	390.09976
but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground ? ?	1982.1493
at geneva in 1954 , to get the war in indo-china settled , the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state , north viet nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos .	669.045
the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west .	2350.2437
he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj .	229.64537
`` the important thing from now on ' ' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia ' ' .	394.58148
russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana , russian intrigue in the congo , and russian arms drops in laos ( using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time .	815.2435
soviet premier khrushchev sent new year ' s hopes for peace to president-elect kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply .	684.7352
considering the state of the whole world , the cold war ' s three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous	654.9192
but , in senator gore ' s words , it was `` not a very encouraging ' ' situation that would confront john f . kennedy on inauguration day .	423.6765
as the 87th congress began its sessions last week , liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor .	909.7471
the liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost .	1515.2709
this time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable .	407.34607
they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck .	1357.7432
and counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will .	214.09569
there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely mississippi ' s 14-term william meyers colmer ( pronounced calmer ) .	1219.6747
caucusing , the liberals decided to go after colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the house is next to godliness .	516.1392
a dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative .	1627.156
he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents .	1109.3944
he is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-negro ' ' speech .	231.0513
for 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee .	255.84247
there his vote , along with those of chairman howard smith , the courtly virginia judge , and the four republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the rayburn-johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) .	2315.3174
there was sufficient pretext to demand colmer ' s ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi .	1710.5284
reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons .	450.51468
in 1949 the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry truman , and in 1957 , after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage .	2563.3066
( in the heat of the anti-colmer drive last week , judge smith threatened reprisal against powell .	1685.7527
said he `` we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here ' ' .	276.07306
) but speaker sam rayburn , after huddling in palm beach with president-elect kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective .	477.61734
in a tense , closed-door session with judge smith , rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the rules committee ( two democrats , including one southerner , and one republican ) .	759.9181
smith flatly rejected the offer , and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels .	1071.642
the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man ' ' .	336.4612
news of rayburn ' s commitment soon leaked out .	469.8757
when missouri ' s clarence cannon got the word , he turned purple .	1917.3569
he shouted , and rushed off to the speaker ' s room to object `` a dangerous precedent ' ' ! !	240.9196
cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the smith-colmer forces as chairman of the appropriations committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects .	1317.7079
sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally , georgia ' s carl vinson , chairman of the armed services committee .	971.27637
as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that judge smith could lose .	995.0044
his highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus .	4044.4097
the liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the democratic committee on committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the house -- before they could oust colmer .	392.7578
( one big question if colmer was to be purged , what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ?	1355.9491
) in all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash .	2788.7512
but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war .	3507.7336
if the southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party .	3558.4934
with that possibility in mind , arkansas ' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees , and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise .	1178.7422
`` here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone ' ' , said a house democratic leader .	431.18176
`` one wants a little more power , and the other doesn ' t want to give up any ' ' .	67.72191
the senate launched the 87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the house ' s guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guide ' s speech .	683.06525
question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ?	1417.5885
a wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from minnesota ' s democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts ' republican leverett saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills .	1430.939
new mexico ' s clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate ' s notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds .	1396.1254
fair dealer humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators .	587.0003
georgia ' s dick russell objected politely , and the battle was joined .	723.61017
privately , the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage .	1209.1926
privately , they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson ' s three-fifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon .	2959.803
in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress , and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding .	586.5694
armed with the nixon opinion , the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week .	1496.2811
hopefully , the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all .	668.65076
since election day , vice president richard nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view .	722.8994
but with the convening of the new congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the senate until john kennedy ' s inauguration .	214.78047
one day last week , nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration ' ' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election .	507.23325
nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration ' ' .	170.10217
`` this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated ' ' , he said .	127.1925
the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves .	536.7971
gary player , the small , trim south african , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap .	595.86646
arnold palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief .	2250.2898
`` just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you ' ' , player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament .	597.23724
and that is just what happened on the last few holes .	450.0644
the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer .	813.6773
player was the first to feel its teeth .	316.2912
after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( sunday ' s fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , player ' s game rapidly fell to pieces .	808.4474
after a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th .	2080.2424
he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .	2556.9731
as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , player was almost in tears .	1148.6542
he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke .	579.027
palmer had started the round four strokes behind player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes .	749.9185
now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf .	727.6495
when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won .	760.23663
but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression .	1433.2361
in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower .	1067.3063
afterwards , palmer told charlie coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast .	1444.6039
he did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out , giving palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost .	991.70953
when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet .	560.97833
palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts ' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt .	1179.4331
palmer ' s 281 for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe .	1311.1351
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 .	1906.5106
until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place .	898.93384
as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69 .	2948.6504
his three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by bill collins , the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long .	1723.4414
but palmer knew , as did everybody else at augusta , that his streak was about to be broken .	598.4454
half an hour after he finished his round , player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of palmer .	1675.8185
more than a streak had ended .	270.45142
long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player .	1926.7943
unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case .	344.18372
when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmer ' s towering prestige .	640.8603
as if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments .	474.70566
but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago , player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere .	1039.8549
on the final round at pensacola , the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come .	531.6342
on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it .	715.98517
but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour .	323.72623
player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer .	462.82947
he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer ' s 71 .	372.26013
thereafter , until the masters , player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami .	1408.6871
when they reached augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date .	264.3676
on thursday , the first day of the masters , the contest between palmer and player developed instantly .	404.99872
it was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course .	669.34906
the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences .	1342.0824
palmer ' s 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with bob rosburg .	878.45264
but player was only one stroke back , with a 69 .	608.1331
even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between palmer and player .	538.07465
a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70	1108.4912
or ken venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better	1045.2223
or rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augusta ' s treacheries	6174.268
or even old byron nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf .	1661.7207
( on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe .	5584.864
on friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus .	796.64825
rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time palmer and player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day .	323.37384
as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .	1423.168
player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th .	1160.83
on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament .	418.94244
he birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 .	738.0884
starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle , palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 .	1759.5068
the roar of palmer ' s gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of player ' s gallery for a similar triumph .	635.5779
at one point late in the day , when palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole .	913.08124
without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply .	2270.731
anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course .	1480.061
it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence .	1123.7687
the bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions .	3452.8342
byron nelson did , hogan did .	5008.2593
and last week at the masters palmer and player did .	919.45404
as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was player ' s superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead .	344.05804
this day palmer had started first .	432.999
as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day .	532.9848
player immediately proceeded to follow suit .	3620.2996
in fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes .	668.3273
but player ' s real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards .	1581.3829
he hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways .	1836.6559
having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out .	437.64767
player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling .	1001.7736
the latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green .	1927.7456
`` i was hitting the ball well ' ' , player said later , `` and i felt strong .	203.66672
when you ' re playing like that you ' d better attack ' ' .	212.9914
player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget .	956.2696
it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge .	389.66177
from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 .	647.62103
palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles .	547.07214
they started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 .	6870.3047
on this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days .	581.6609
at the 4th tee palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .	664.4981
his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par .	1182.8699
starting the second nine , palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it .	935.608
when mickey charles mantle , the new york yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime .	894.6017
when roger eugene maris , mantle ' s muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe .	1326.2126
but when tiny , 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there ' ' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous .	768.03845
this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .	1051.8109
it is the year when ( 1 ) amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs	4294.6104
( 2 ) willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammate ' s bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game	1044.1334
( 3 ) the milwaukee braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them	1604.3005
and ( 4 ) catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter .	1321.2407
pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal .	1003.34595
experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion .	1375.9008
whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division .	1227.374
of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy .	735.20844
this , of course , is baseball ' s most remarkable mark the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , george herman ( babe ) ruth of the yankees .	940.3036
since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruth ' s record and each , in turn , has been thwarted .	482.09634
what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth ' s amazing september surge .	3209.1025
in the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched .	1210.5652
always , in the abortive attacks upon ruth ' s record , one man alone -- a jimmy foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a hank greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a hack wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid .	1550.3888
but now , for the first time since lou gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 .	1238.284
their names are mantle and maris , their team is the yankees , and their threat is real .	226.76407
after 108 games in 1927 , ruth had 35 home runs .	1627.3073
after 108 games in 1961 , mickey mantle has 43 , roger maris 41 .	1474.0055
extend mantle ' s and maris ' s present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs .	864.02686
this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them .	577.6603
to better ruth ' s mark , neither needs a spectacular september flourish .	890.9185
all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september , and he will establish a new record .	288.66257
in ruth ' s day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games .	372.55844
baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruth ' s record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games .	491.44662
`` even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation ' ' , insists hank greenberg , now vice-president of the chicago white sox .	506.09702
`` it has to be easier with two of them .	133.04855
how can you walk maris to get to mantle ' ' ? ?	244.12936
neither mantle nor maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself .	1586.8541
although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player ' s standard quote `` the important thing is to win the pennant ' ' .	314.8513
but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle , the american league ' s most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 , and maris , the mvp in 1960 .	558.7695
each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` i hope roger hits 80 ' ' , mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and i hope i hit 81 ' ' ) .	1025.7985
the sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( mantle ' s in dallas , maris ' s in kansas city ) , they are rooming together .	195.76445
mantle , maris , and bob cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in jamaica , long island , not far from new york international airport .	1172.7775
the three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture .	1035.1482
mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom	948.40906
maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room .	995.94183
they divide up the household chores cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible ) , and maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium .	1728.8086
mantle , maris , and cerv probably share one major-league record already among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for cerv , four for mantle , and three for maris .	1286.9402
as roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , mantle , 29 , who broke in with the yankees ten years ago , and maris , 26 , who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds .	451.64496
both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( mantle in commerce , okla . , maris in fargo , n . d . )	385.14853
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma ( `` sometimes in the minors ' ' , maris recalls , `` i wished i had gone to oklahoma ' ' ) .	252.1793
to an extent , the two even look alike .	530.7518
both have blue eyes and short blond hair .	1142.8934
both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger .	3393.654
with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order .	1135.4241
maris purchases $100 suits from simpson ' s in new york .	203.90138
mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and pays as much as $250 each .	1465.8271
neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , henry miller ' s `` tropic of cancer ' ' .	962.55414
mantle so appreciated miller ' s delicate literary style that he broadened teammates ' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips .	5204.429
mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .	541.1675
`` what do you and mickey talk about at home ' ' ? ?	170.40555
`` to tell you the truth ' ' , maris said , `` mickey don ' t talk much ' ' .	86.52835
this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer .	1335.9905
what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative .	755.26056
of the two , mantle is by nature the less outgoing , maris the more outspoken .	755.3358
but last week , when a reporter was standing near mantle ' s locker , mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote .	967.6821
`` see that kid ' ' ? ?	8.005108
he said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy .	1600.1549
`` that ' s ( yogi ) berra ' s .	553.73285
i ' ll never forget one time i struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game .	543.2672
i came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says ' you stunk ' ' ' .	830.4172
maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen .	1565.9813
`` when i ' ve made a dumb play ' ' , he says , `` i don ' t want to talk to anyone .	81.174934
by his own confession , maris is an angry young man .	405.71832
benched at tulsa in 1955 , he told manager dutch meyer `` i can ' t play for you .	327.48004
send me where i can play ' ' .	16.859743
( meyer sent him to reading , pa . .	297.24173
) benched at indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager kerby farrell `` i ' m not learning anything on the bench .	884.49896
( farrell did -- and maris led the team to victory in the little world series .	426.84674
) `` that ' s the way i am ' ' , he says .	65.707
`` i tell people what i think .	290.2249
if you ' re a good ballplayer , you ' ve got to get mad .	233.14746
give me a team of nine angry men and i ' ll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we ' ll beat you nine out of ten times ' ' .	299.44836
one good indication of the two men ' s personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes .	381.90405
`` when i was a kid ' ' , maris told a sportswriter last week , `` i used to follow williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not ' ' .	213.19705
`` when you came up to the majors , did you seek out williams for advice ' ' ? ?	198.25018
`` are you kidding ' ' ? ?	9.033566
`` you ' re afraid to talk to a guy you idolize ' ' .	412.24268
`` when mickey went to the yankees ' ' , says mark freeman , an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver , `` dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his .	680.6991
but dimaggio never said a word .	145.42874
he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him ' ' .	174.19557
among all the yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies .	336.87302
neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else .	1138.8015
if laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the yankees , maris would lay ties on a railroad track .	529.9248
if working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the yankees , mantle would work in a zinc mine .	827.86584
but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , mantle and maris concentrate on baseball .	1231.0826
they try to play baseball the best they can .	580.933
mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well .	267.13785
( `` one of the reasons they get along fine ' ' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize mantle is head-and-shoulders above maris ' ' .	385.56952
) hitting , mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , maris only left-handed .	3945.4348
they both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings .	8193.317
mantle is considerably better hitting for average (	4805.7603
, fourth in the league , to	194.43932
for maris so far this year ) .	165.14279
both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues	2202.6633
mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base .	4409.837
both have brilliant speed mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3 . 1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer	1471.5756
maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the white sox .	1823.7017
both are good , daring fielders mantle covers more ground	45275.098
yet with all their skills , the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic the home run .	438.2934
with this ultimate weapon , the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season .	1759.2526
( american league expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams .	1323.3108

appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball ' s lowest moment .	269.8582
in 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball .	2266.9263
something was needed to revive interest	5195.0073
the something was the home run .	562.06836
into washington on president-elect john f . kennedy ' s convair , the caroline , winged actor-crooner frank sinatra and his close hollywood pal , cinemactor peter lawford , jack kennedy ' s brother-in-law .	3077.4
also included in the entourage a dog in a black sweater , frankie and peter had an urgent mission to stage a mammoth inauguration eve entertainment gala in the capital ' s national guard armory .	2060.4253
frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival `` it ' s really tremendous when you think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia .	1292.9651
i could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans ' ' ! !	101.18495
as the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory ' s $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10 , 000 each .	2555.173
the biggest single act would doubtless be staged by frankie himself his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by hollywood couturier don loper , who regularly makes up ladies ' ensembles .	4133.4946
soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered `` two of everything ' ' just `` in case he spills anything ' ' , frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of loper clothing .	1041.6941
a year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps , general david m . shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless new year ' ' greeting to his pentagon staff .	1204.4406
said leatherneck shoup `` a year ago i took the grips of the plow in my hands .	235.20137
after pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , i lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on .	1192.3759
little geeing and hawing have been necessary ' ' .	57.246727
but shoup also gave the corps a tilling in spots .	2030.3082
speaking of `` pride ' ' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940	1128.5139

meanwhile , after 24 years in the senate , rhode island ' s durable democrat theodore francis greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last november ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the senate .	652.35345
the most famous undergraduate of south philadelphia high school is a current bobby-sox idol , dreamboat cacophonist fabian ( real name fabian forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while .	1463.371
the principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia -- fabian is a 10-o ' clock scholar in english and mathematics .	2287.1072
lacking his needed credits in those subjects , fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week .	1470.7772
south philadelphia high ' s principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure ' ' of a movie that the toneless lad was making .	338.12762

one of nikita khrushchev ' s most enthusiastic eulogizers , the u . s . s . r . ' s daily izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed red-prone comedian charlie chaplin at his swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 .	636.3447
chaplin , 71 , who met k . when the soviet boss visited england in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit russia some time this summer because `` i have marveled at your grandiose experiment and i believe in your future ' ' .	656.8905
then charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the nikita he had glimpsed `` i was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face ' ' .	726.61694
g . david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe ' s best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh .	560.84143
there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art .	2870.1814
last week , in the german city of dusseldorf , g . david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause .	937.19885
on display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale .	736.4761
like philadelphia ' s late dr . albert c . barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( time , jan . 2 ) , thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime .	284.779
he made his fortune during world war 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom .	340.2496
even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings .	563.6893
he gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best .	276.44348
he was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the museum of modern art ' s alfred barr said of him `` i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didn ' t know about ' ' .	356.25748
he might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting .	1210.9163
he could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough .	1724.1869
he bought up cezannes , braques , matisses , legers , a splendid picasso series , more than 70 giacometti sculptures .	1849.5249
he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world .	507.42654
all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone ' s throw , outside pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them .	749.0016
two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city .	226.59901
but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum .	415.287
pittsburgh turned him down , just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years .	749.827
he went then to a 40-year-old basel art dealer named ernst beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures .	2055.9187
last year beyeler arranged to sell $1 , 500 , 000 worth of klees to the state of north rhine-westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built .	481.39206
last week most of the other prizes , once offered to pittsburgh , went on the block .	234.83604
at the opening of the dusseldorf show , thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time .	455.47733
in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them .	345.29166
some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town .	385.5004
thompson himself said `` i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures ' ' .	410.49454
the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color .	415.75003
but in all its 175 years , not a single negro student has entered its classrooms .	1141.4518
last week federal district judge william a . bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified ' ' negro boy and girl .	660.8214
their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in georgia -- and in alabama , mississippi and south carolina as well .	766.65936
for 18 months , hamilton holmes , 19 , and charlayne hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university .	347.07394
they graduated together from atlanta ' s turner high school , where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third .	581.1267
the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins .	500.0444
holmes went to atlanta ' s morehouse ( negro ) college , where he is a b student and star halfback .	854.96497
charlayne studied journalism at detroit ' s wayne state university .	449.13635
last fall , after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court , judge bootle ordered them to apply again .	994.018
charlayne was `` tentatively ' ' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state .	981.5645
but holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview ' ' .	102.19123
the evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation .	577.99335
holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse ' ' .	230.35683
no , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive ' ' .	416.9531
they also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested ' ' .	147.51077
their reason holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended .	1713.1005
negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes .	798.79285
the real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school .	788.07135
judge bootle ' s decision `` the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color ' ' .	445.82797
the state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university .	270.42792
`` surprised and pleased ' ' , students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week .	357.69003
when the university of chicago ' s chancellor lawrence a . kimpton submitted his resignation last march , a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway .	1273.6534
out went letters to 60 , 000 old grads , asking for suggestions .	1002.54767
such academic statesmen as james b . conant were consulted .	802.1139
two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors , including adlai stevenson , richard nixon , and harvard ' s dean mcgeorge bundy .	1585.7897
the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as trustee chairman glen a . lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right ' ' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago .	684.6399
last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech ' s acting dean of the faculty dynamic geneticist george wells beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( time , cover , july 14 , 1958 ) .	1875.0673
it fell to chancellor kimpton , now a standard oil ( indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins .	4018.5156
he threw out some of hutchins ' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2 , 100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139 . 3 million .	4477.343
but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era .	1000.9733
at caltech , geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school ' s famous biology division since 1946 .	592.0029
but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making .	3304.359
beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters	1178.355
he avidly reads the wall street journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model a ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 .	996.7239
a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end .	798.88885
but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away .	601.21545
the man was king leopold 2 , of the belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good .	730.2282
by force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900 , 000 square miles of wilderness in central africa .	884.23114
this is an area nearly as large as western europe	3749.103
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .	1903.4476
its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings	1291.5768
they were determined by the points at which leopold ' s explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .	1065.2999
the population of the congo is 13 . 5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters ' ' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects .	1218.3563
the religions of the people include christianity , mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism .	4591.469
the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate .	5962.271
the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .	3238.4265
to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case	952.5211
it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done , or failed to do , in the congo since 1885 .	243.13864
at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property .	1086.3407
but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience .	650.69635
the belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism .	1122.6305
one definition of paternalism is `` the principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children ' ' .	136.75969
the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment .	251.35681
ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant .	603.8594
the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil .	444.07162
the colony was administered from brussels , with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote .	887.66144
the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock .	639.247
in inside africa , john gunther describes one of these , the societe generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the house of morgan , anaconda copper , the mutual life insurance company of new york , the pennsylvania railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the united states government as a heavy partner ' ' .	782.439
had they been truly ruthless , the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion .	1103.0055
they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes	3422.2283
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent	790.5482
they put much effort into public housing .	599.21747
they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food .	692.08624
but instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often .	729.5158
would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ?	336.96585
the belgians also placed great emphasis on education .	340.54843
during the 1950s there were as many as 25 , 000 schools in the congo .	187.95772
but almost all the schools were primary .	524.0663
the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte ' ' and `` le chien ' ' and write his name .	235.38773
some schools were technical -- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .	724.7377
but they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .	451.4148
it was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together ' ' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .	218.64839
indeed , the belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .	2577.2
when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13 . 5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .	472.4677
why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ?	849.5786
in one large oversimplification , it might be said that the belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping africa .	468.16147
they lacked time to prepare the congo , as the british and french had prepared their colonies .	390.46844
the congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant	756.0843
and in brussels , street crowds shouted , `` pas une goutte de sang ! !	10735.63
' ' ( not one drop of blood ! !	249.11443
the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue	1430.3993
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess .	289.55505
it is hard to blame them for this .	149.76915
yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless .	948.75964
as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate .	961.781
first , there were those congolese ( among them joseph kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , balkanizing it .	4941.7183
second , there were those ( moise tshombe ) who favored near-balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states .	1544.3231
third , there were those ( notably patrice lumumba ) who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government .	2022.333
and fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up .	645.9584
however , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting .	567.0643
a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration .	437.91196
they had divided the congo into six provinces -- leopoldville , kasai , kivu , katanga , equator and eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings .	2206.005
thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war .	781.3824
the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable western-style form of government there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces .	956.2989
well-wishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .	517.1157
if internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25 , 000-man congolese army , the force publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians .	931.90393
the president , joseph kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , patrice lumumba , a reasonable man .	776.08203
twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other .	4686.741
presently the well-armed members of the force publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting .	3673.3083
terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country .	401.2329
the belgian government decided to act , and on july 10 dispatched paratroops to the congo .	527.2033
on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of katanga , moise tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country .	1331.7183
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence .	266.29437
lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians , and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them .	297.70386
on july 14 the security council -- with france and great britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the u . n . into the congo .	490.12137
vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( congolese ) government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the government , to meet fully their tasks .	249.94304
secretary-general hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the u . n . troops sent into the congo were to come from african , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the u . s . , russia , great britain or france .	223.12157
he quickly called on ghana , tunisia , morocco , guinea and mali , which dispatched troops within hours .	6163.367
ultimately the u . n . army in the congo reached a top strength of 19 , 000 , including about 5 , 000 from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden , who were the only whites .	317.40546
it took the u . n . three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo .	90.32559
the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed u . n . efforts .	160.36877
the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the u . n . to get out of the congo along with the belgians , and appealed to russia for help .	308.91483
( however , there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist .	286.59775
before appealing to the u . n . or to russia , he first appealed to the u . s . for military help , and was rejected .	86.704666
) lumumba further complicated the u . n . ' s mission by initiating small `` wars ' ' with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which , under albert kalonji , wanted to secede as well .	389.02832
meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo , sending lumumba equipment for his `` wars ' ' , dispatching `` technicians ' ' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly .	572.23364
but by the end of the three-month period , in october 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the congo .	368.8698
president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him .	291.88828
control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of joseph mobutu , chief of staff of the congolese army .	457.71948
mobutu promptly flung out the russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at u . n . headquarters in new york .	377.0768
the belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops .	1273.075
but they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers ' ' or `` mercenaries ' ' , who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga , the seceded province which , according to tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country .	467.01343
from october 1960 to february 1961 , the u . n . forces in the congo took little action .	127.71693
there was no directive for it -- the security council ' s resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or balkanize it .	473.59192
during the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo .	1294.5227
in february the murder of patrice lumumba , who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe , again stirred the u . n . to action .	448.72836
on feb . 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort ' ' .	269.86618
although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one .	234.58803
it also urged that the u . n . eject , and prevent the return of , all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers	384.10605
ordered an investigation of lumumba ' s death	214.2684
urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army .	185.98447
though president john f . kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloy ' s unexpected report from khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of u . s . foreign policy last week .	363.506
high up on the president ' s priority list was the thorny question of bizerte .	790.5233
on this issue , the president received a detailed report from his u . n . ambassador adlai stevenson , who had just returned from paris , and mr . kennedy asked stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both paris and tunis -- out of the imbroglio .	447.08102
ideally , the president would like the french to agree on a `` status quo ante ' ' on bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base .	646.46716
to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , mr . kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend .	607.41144
the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no . 2 man in the tunisian government , defense minister bahi ladgham , who flew to washington last week to seek u . s . support .	356.6285
the conversation apparently convinced mr . kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable .	304.62555
through ladgham , mr . kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba	1393.2603
and one u . s . official said `` the key question now is which side picks up the phone first ' ' .	315.26367
on the latin american front , the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the inter-american economic and social council ( which the president himself had originally hoped to attend ) .	675.59454
main purpose of the meeting to discuss president kennedy ' s alliance for progress .	128.1286
in conferences with nationalist china ' s dapper , diminutive vice president chen cheng , mr . kennedy assured chiang kai-shek ' s emissary that the u . s . is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations .	510.96152
chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia	408.946
however the president , who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow , would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the u . s . if outer mongolia ' s admission comes to a vote .	881.7802
the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid .	2831.3604
to africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , attorney general robert kennedy , on a good-will mission to the ivory coast .	843.63184
all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs	1063.4093
in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared `` we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason ' ' .	312.2306
from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston , as the great four-jet boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at phoenix , el paso , and san antonio .	917.16394
when continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11 30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer .	439.4316
the plane put down on schedule at 1 35 a . m . in phoenix .	134.8141
thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for el paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard .	427.01166
at 3 57 a . m . , with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso , passenger robert berry , a san antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit .	520.61957
`` the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach ' ' , berry said .	288.31564
`` i figured he was sick ' ' .	28.775793
john salvador , a farmer from palm desert , calif . , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit .	556.44086
`` the kid had a automatic , like they issue in the army ' ' , he said .	115.29101
`` the other fellow had a ' ' .	29.13244
salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess lois carnegey	10078.586
the man put his at the head of capt . byron d . rickards .	893.36255
to rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story his plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa .	1848.3074
but last week ' s pirates , like the cuban-american who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra ( newsweek , aug . 7 ) , wanted to go to havana .	755.8017
`` tell your company there are four of us here with guns ' ' , the elder man told rickards .	311.59998
the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message .	337.3982
but , he told the `` skyjackers ' ' , the 707 didn ' t carry enough fuel to reach havana	336.17545
they would have to refuel at el paso .	2816.141
most passengers didn ' t know what had happened until they got on the ground .	150.75932
jerry mccauley of sacramento , calif . , one of some twenty air force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion .	485.15884
`` the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba ' ' , mccauley said , `` and like a nut i raised my hand .	234.24352
i thought he was the air force recruiter ' ' .	440.86615
what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew .	659.5672
they chose four jack casey , who works for continental airlines in houston	1317.375
fred mullen from mercer island , wash .	710.1346
pfc . truman cleveland of st . augustine .	33.495518
fla . , and leonard gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the u . s . immigration service border patrol .	743.3713
everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at 4 18 a . m . .	245.38387
they found a large welcoming group -- el paso policemen , border patrol , sheriff ' s deputies , and fbi men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns .	1606.4591
other fbi men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana .	730.50995
the ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours .	2036.6731
still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propeller-driven douglas aj .	3403.5784
actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane	802.1942
they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of cuba ' s fidel castro who had taken over the 707 .	314.74203
mr . kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone .	448.9175
at one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot , the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba .	626.6748
as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment .	1302.4854
from the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being cubans , were native americans , subsequently identified as leon bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge , ariz . , and his son , cody , 16 , a high-school junior .	837.0882
the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens .	272.8665
the father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business ' ' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons .	284.14267
at 7 30 a . m . , more than three hours after landing , the beardens gave an ultimatum	533.21716
take off or see the hostages killed .	2755.7068
the tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a . m . , and captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway .	841.3071
several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet .	1417.0526
the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines	2688.0754
the plane slowed to a halt .	342.03067
ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it .	354.2714
at 12 50 p . m . a ramp was rolled up to the plane .	91.13418
a few minutes later , fbi agent francis crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed .	1622.6342
while crosby distracted the beardens , stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door .	6323.472
so did hostages casey , cleveland , and mullen .	682.3012
that left only the four crew members , crosby , and border patrolman gilman , all unarmed , with the beardens .	1184.0848
the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket .	313.49792
gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance .	251.53583
he caught officer simmons ' eye , nodded toward young bearden , and -- `` i swung my right as hard as i could .	644.8124
simmons and crosby jumped the boy and it was all over ' ' .	77.574715
frog-marched off the airplane at 1 48 p . m . , the beardens were held in bail of $100 , 000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines .	880.33417
( bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to castro , and live high in cuba .	443.92896
) back home in coolidge , ariz . , his 36-year-old wife , mary , said `` i thought they were going to phoenix to look for jobs ' ' .	379.77106
taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation .	263.10913
the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in u . s . history .	752.5023
with the money all but in hand , however , the administration indicated that , instead of the 225 , 000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160 , 000 .	260.36554
the `` hold-back ' ' , as pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently .	1015.08057
in all , the senate signed a check for $46 . 7 billion , which not only included the extra $3 . 5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for .	817.1845
( the senate , on its own , decided to provide additional b-52 and other long-range bombers for the strategic air command .	567.2358
) the house , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the president ' s urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order .	395.76425
in other areas , congressional action last week included	1408.1887
the senate ( by voice vote ) and the house ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign , not too unhappily .	532.59204
the senate also voted $5 . 2 billion to finance the government ' s health , welfare , and labor activities .	230.20935
debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend .	1116.627
white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact .	2848.4023
most members of the u . s . senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can .	147.77818
but , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter .	1432.4695
as a result , ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it .	810.5205
over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-american course .	3837.454
individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from michigan , soft-shell crabs from maryland , oysters from washington , grapefruit from florida .	2265.6736
but plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late sen . fred dubois of idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the senate ' s stomach was in the right place .	316.63632
in a daring stroke , the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10 , 000-per-year french-born maitre d ' hotel .	1653.6147
holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .	700.0507
long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward .	1017.12665
higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues .	1950.1678
result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .	2344.932
things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds .	857.8975
traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .	440.43814
that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates .	4247.5933
as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments .	2030.5416
another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds .	1124.7416
other tax-exempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21 , according to standard & poor ' s average .	559.257
on balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then .	719.59955
however , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend .	1081.0975
investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds .	1133.8815
you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page .	131.28654
many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that .	469.0275
and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds .	331.21976
that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds .	489.26605
it ' s not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on u . s . treasury bonds .	129.26457
for investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high .	336.29266
it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16 , 000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32 , 000 of taxed income .	694.57367
a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in february or march -- shows what is happening .	1034.8042
the report is based on a survey by blyth & company , investment bankers .	1306.5934
nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period .	678.69745
and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession .	718.6788
many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .	1212.622
indication the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward .	2433.1345
look , for example , at the ohio turnpike .	151.05635
traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february , as compared with those same months in 1960 .	602.69806
then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs .	515.78546
as a result , the road ' s net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds .	469.89206
that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months .	429.8261
that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike .	1258.8427
operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in march .	180.40266
costs were held down , despite a bitter winter .	342.49808
for the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period .	355.27658
the road ' s engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston .	810.3293
some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do .	284.46466
the 187-mile illinois state toll highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until december , 1958 .	592.39343
in the 12 months ended in february , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves .	567.43054
in the 12 months ended in february , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest .	506.1115
in the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 .	407.57513
success , for many turnpikes , has come hard .	621.64825
traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers ' rosy estimates .	446.0842
in these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways .	1186.4648
many rate increases already have been put into effect .	213.77283
higher tolls are planned for july 1 , 1961 , on the richmond-petersburg , va . , turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study .	502.25937
progress is being made , too , in improving motorists ' access to many turnpikes .	726.59546
the kansas turnpike offers an illustration .	482.58484
net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb . 28 , 1961 .	861.85095
further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city , kans . , and kansas city , mo . .	597.86066
meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road ' s reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .	285.0776
investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals .	2416.6782
traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike .	1402.1825
if nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 .	336.49026
west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same .	411.71265
these , however , are exceptions .	307.74716
the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement .	2796.6333
it ' s going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full .	306.64154
already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins .	1060.3171
many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point .	816.7661
a top american official , after a look at europe ' s factories , thinks the u . s . is in a `` very serious situation ' ' competitively .	119.46482
commerce secretary luther hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on may 10 toured plants of two of italy ' s biggest companies -- fiat , the auto producer , and olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines .	635.1679
our staff man cabled from turin as follows --	2571.4722
`` follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant , and you learn this	356.5384
`` one , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the marshall plan -- enables fiat to turn out 2 , 100 cars a day .	826.971
about half of these are exported .	2500.5117
`` two , wage costs are a fraction of the u . s . costs .	70.046234
a skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week .	413.5908
`` three , labor troubles are infrequent .	2907.194
fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years .	193.43715
`` said secretary hodges ' it ' s a tough combination for the u . s . to face .	88.66271
`` olivetti had a special interest for hodges .	2765.2063
olivetti took over underwood , the u . s . typewriter maker , in late 1959 .	136.76465
within a year , without reducing wages , underwood ' s production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed .	1177.6191
the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled .	14742.401
`` the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout , modern machinery .	2929.0483
the firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious .	5870.8765
`` hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the u . s . .	44.244385
the inflow of foreign capital would help the u . s . balance of payments .	85.75858
`` hodges predicted ' i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the u . s . .	157.64378
there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' ' ' .	123.23389
foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports .	1538.0875
the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines .	473.147
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these	2331.765
an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy .	1250.5337
chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting .	1434.0708
the u . s . will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years .	447.14645
point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet .	796.0491
if they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would .	2581.9355
idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible .	1934.1843
at the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries .	942.0781
japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily ' ' curbing exports of textiles to the u . s . .	177.13536
hong kong , india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the `` lancashire pact ' ' .	529.35706
none of these countries is happy with these arrangements .	412.94562
the japanese want to increase exports to the u . s . while they have been curbing shipments , they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big u . s . market .	262.49985
hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain , while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly .	5820.9404
the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons .	817.67487
the kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in asia and europe will see that `` dumping ' ' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas .	1249.8619
gradual , controlled expansion of the world ' s textile trade is what president kennedy wants .	133.45032
this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products .	1564.1127
it ' s an important clue to washington thinking .	834.2108
note , too , that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the u . s . textile industry .	572.89294
`` get competitive or get out ' ' .	57.07109
in veiled terms , that ' s what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry .	237.36256
the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn ' t seem feasible .	1042.5548
special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed .	569.5134
government research will look into new products and methods .	276.54092
import quotas aren ' t ruled out where the national interest is involved .	260.37027
but the kennedy administration doesn ' t favor import quotas .	431.50223
rather , they are impressed with the british government ' s success in forcing -- and helping -- the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products .	491.83414
what ' s happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries .	1206.9053
among the highest-paid workers in the world are u . s . coal miners .	80.86683
yet u . s . coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers ' mouths water .	3236.1726
steel company of wales , a british steelmaker , wants to bring in virginia coal , cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets .	541.68256
virginia coal , delivered by ship in wales , will be about $2 . 80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines .	1457.03
u . s . coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight .	2145.723
many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting , narrow and very deep .	1637.4644
productivity of u . s . miners is twice that of the british .	135.81577
welsh coal miners , communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal .	642.9377
the british government will have to decide whether to let u . s . coal in .	145.98395
the british coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can ' t sell .	1011.08215
every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` i ' m sorry , but we don ' t have that book .	477.81686
there wouldn ' t be much demand for it , i ' m afraid ' ' .	93.37031
behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest .	484.3879
what to buy out of the year ' s grist of nearly 15 , 000 book titles ? ?	246.7746
what to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ?	1455.764
most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate .	3541.6772
a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian ' s salary , and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world ' s richest city .	318.44406
the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse .	1344.8351
confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds .	689.2441
in some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis .	391.9296
new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow .	407.44202
because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the new york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works .	441.67203
at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area .	912.5834
at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve .	879.1994
both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state .	661.57117
it was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today .	393.67206
under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts .	677.92737
an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit .	517.3816
some library boards are wary of the plan .	282.9623
a large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great .	265.4619
a small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board .	726.01294
within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved .	196.7968
the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system .	395.41153
all services are given without cost to members .	726.05133
so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op .	515.2284
to set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100 , 000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it .	513.3005
the collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection .	184.53229
each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency .	230.9491
the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars .	748.9597
in nassau county , for example , the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 .	497.5539
this system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation .	406.5158
the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area .	322.60178
the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford .	702.77185
nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100 , 000 volumes by 1965 .	484.83066
the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers .	397.6288
basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries .	456.48428
on microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals .	477.89343
the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans .	603.5507
headquarters gets about 100 requests every day .	5563.3286
it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide .	389.5713
the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries .	782.10815
each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon .	700.05536
east meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion	253.56343
freeport houses social science , pure science , and language	362.8474
history , biography , and education are centered in hempstead	3677.3003
levittown has applied science , business , and literature	134.62845
while hewlett-woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages .	449.28458
the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service .	469.0159
this kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course .	158.38492
public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis .	846.93286
local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library .	483.6508
the system passes on these savings to its members .	272.18295
further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing .	1012.182
books are not the only resource of the system .	167.5971
schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities .	1208.6744
the most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge .	687.2979
this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` nanook of the north ' ' , `` the emperor ' s nightingale ' ' , and `` the red balloon ' ' .	239.94246
workshops are conducted by the system ' s audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service .	343.6029
the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together	317.4707
consequently an experienced children ' s librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children ' s librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits .	976.30145
headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection .	1388.7115
sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups .	2288.5754
story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children ' s consultant .	236.74063
headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries .	937.09875
in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children ' s program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county	1006.2057
it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries	1767.3007
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used	1601.6864
and it publishes sum and substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system ' s activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries .	304.3822
the system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership .	652.54297
in nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general .	273.27362
librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today .	649.87836
library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans , the teen-agers .	435.2921
to them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` i ' m sorry , we don ' t have that book ' ' .	107.464874
today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned .	494.47018
the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world .	422.42462
the need for lifetime reading is apparent .	697.56885
education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society .	390.06406
the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life .	308.5712
we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read	331.28247
if we are not discriminating in our reading	1275.4872
if we do not know how to use what we do read .	163.0812
we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word .	523.1375
a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries .	187.55841
although progress has been made in america ' s system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america .	300.556
the problem grows in intensity each year as man ' s knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand .	301.61914
the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition .	5229.804
there are , for example , approximately 25 , 000 , 000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50 , 000 , 000 with inadequate service .	243.56601
in college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1 , 509 institutions surveyed last year by the u . s . office of education .	326.45154
and over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all .	279.74786
in every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services .	470.94342
only public understanding and support can provide that service .	368.8554
this is one of the main reasons for national library week , april 16-22 , and for its theme `` for a richer , fuller life , read ' ' ! !	301.5993
the general assembly , which adjourns today , has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened .	976.9329
it was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools , an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education .	531.4152
there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight , in which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers .	524.2332
the final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need .	503.54468
long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government .	831.43024
this session , for instance , may have insured a financial crisis two years from now .	2607.7705
in all the turmoil , some good legislation was passed .	307.1581
some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action .	651.1147
certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue .	945.0981
no action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales .	1184.6411
only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state .	1011.4062
the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions .	167.25272
fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like anything but `` the empire state of the south ' ' .	448.40857
we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation .	338.14697
in the interim between now and next year , we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgia ' s very real economic , fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics .	742.71436
league regularly stands on the side of right	142.75175
the league of women voters , 40 now and admitting it proudly , is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive .	2183.9854
it ' s a good use of money .	222.64554
these women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jefferson ' s dictum that one must cherish the people ' s spirit but `` keep alive their attention ' ' .	456.27756
`` if once they become inattentive to the public affairs ' ' , jefferson said , `` you and i , and congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves ' ' .	448.92758
newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs .	750.15497
the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public .	669.66797
the harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in .	451.3115
and the league takes a stand , with great regularity , on the side of right .	216.65823
look to coosa valley for industrial progress	721.34094
cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission .	1203.4406
coupling its own budget of $83 , 750 with a $30 , 000 state grant authorized by gov . vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in march with georgia tech . .	943.1902
then a full-time planning office will be established in rome to work with a five-member georgia tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program .	708.3806
it recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach .	1423.6906
the rusk belief in balanced defense , replacing the dulles theory of massive retaliation , removes a grave danger that has existed .	1374.7452
the danger lay not in believing that our own a-bombs would deter russia ' s use of hers	2822.6763
that theory was and is sound .	223.82712
the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough .	3348.3096
by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war .	754.1357
this strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war .	146.14163
it also weakened our diplomatic stance , because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity .	1185.5107
this left the soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity .	32170.959
by maintaining the nuclear deterrent , but gearing american military forces to fight conventional wars too , secretary of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position .	2491.0327
dekalb budget shows county is on beam	1033.3801
dekalb ' s budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance .	420.1977
it includes a raise in the county minimum wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance .	679.00275
that such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by chairman charles o . emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials .	605.9991
somewhere , somebody is bound to love us	530.99805
g . mennen williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly .	1925.7325
touring africa , the new u . s . assistant secretary of state observed `` africa should be for the africans ' ' and the british promptly denounced him .	256.393
then he arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying `` american imperialists , go home ' ' .	2105.9954
confidence in the state ' s economic future is reflected in the georgia power company ' s record construction budget for this year .	259.2523
the firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning .	588.17316
it is good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization .	507.587
georgia ' s mental health program received a badly needed boost from the general assembly in the form of a $1 , 750 , 000 budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital .	792.828
actually it amounts to $1 , 250 , 000 above what the institution already is receiving , considering the additional half-million dollars gov . vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus .	1255.7833
either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is .	674.2117
but exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing .	501.79712
the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished .	1711.4243
the work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced .	1920.2483
more attendants , nurses and doctors should be hired .	271.54642
patients deserve more attention than they are getting .	194.12646
even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year , georgia will be spending only around $3 . 15 per day per patient .	424.09473
the national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low .	517.17194
kansas , regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill , spends $9 per day per patient .	589.1028
georgia has made some reforms , true .	471.50876
the intensive treatment program is working well .	318.764
but in so many other areas we still are dragging .	789.6523
considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done , it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted .	553.3446
the boost is helpful but inadequate .	939.3737
assassination , even of a tyrant , is repulsive to men of good conscience .	821.4167
rafael trujillo , the often blood-thirsty dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history .	1540.0205
but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered .	1608.2749
trujillo knew a great deal about assassination .	2481.1875
the responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez , a professor at columbia university in new york , has been laid at his door .	794.30865
he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela .	2265.153
it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez , has been uncovered and quashed .	1315.7815
the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive .	779.89233
unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably .	735.00336
but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition .	281.2094
el benefactor ' s vanity grew with his personal wealth .	1324.0953
the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure .	2314.4233
he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise , and his influence extended even to congress .	1065.7546
until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character .	436.20218
tardily the government here came to understand how this country ' s own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression .	546.3451
last year , after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean , the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him .	358.15036
thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines .	14420.932
trujillo ' s dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines .	2000.166
but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans .	5003.2993
there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba , previously a bete noire to trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces .	2286.9163
what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle .	177.68404
the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed .	602.1367
perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger .	296.2086
the dominican republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom .	4619.8345
such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people , who deserve to breathe without fear .	546.4167
for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help .	556.66455
high-speed buses on the george washington memorial parkway , operating between downtown washington and cabin john , glen echo and brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city .	1571.8047
in presenting plans for such express buses before the montgomery county council , the administrator of the ncta , c . darwin stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching .	1518.0132
such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area .	609.87396
because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed .	570.9395
the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress .	298.21423
the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city .	1356.8539
so far as the record is concerned , the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so .	545.98724
though walter ulbricht , by grace of soviet tanks , may be head man in east germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone .	560.29266
the wartime protocol of september 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` greater berlin ' ' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation .	566.4479
it was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by soviet , american , british , and french troops respectively .	527.6349
after the berlin blockade and airlift , the council of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin ' ' .	426.6132
for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas .	712.3193
then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany .	873.2497
that this and the closing of the east berlin-west berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain , france , and the united states sent to moscow after the latter ' s gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german officials to west berlin .	1195.6729
the chancellor had as much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard eisler .	2324.7373
the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities `` to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany ' ' .	572.8651
they insisted on the `` fundamental fact ' ' that `` the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status ' ' .	228.52516
this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact .	2011.0684
there remains , of course , the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts .	564.16095
one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist `` vopos ' ' try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents .	4125.111
another remained when an american army car was recovered but with a broken glass .	1068.1627
the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed .	4764.916
remembering the step-by-step fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about `` salami ' ' tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy ' s representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed .	504.89737
thousands of buffalo ( `` bison ' ' they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland .	2149.1829
a horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth .	10243.199
that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west made in live-oak canyons near hollywood .	1500.7386
for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill .	779.3299
the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county , northeast kansas , as a `` prairie national park ' ' .	915.3002
there the buffalo would roam , to be seen as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens .	1595.1765
wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved .	471.9881
grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them .	3337.0217
the park service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park .	1926.933
american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to approve .	409.25424
a philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on tv and radio .	4395.7246
starting with small stations not members of the national association of broadcasters , the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations .	2331.1921
probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power .	1316.0815
the national association of broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials .	20641.2
past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy .	823.2989
even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition .	771.7058
why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action ? ?	976.61664
simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread .	496.9642
soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors .	1447.3163
although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsie-cola and gulling him into downing bourbon .	9637.17
registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect their party ' s candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization .	440.78815
in the central contest , that for mayor , they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other .	197.96718
mayor robert f . wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office .	620.1265
while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools , law enforcement and fiscal policies .	1167.8292
the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record .	736.68823
state controller arthur levitt , on the other hand , cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city ' s welfare .	269.61432
they , too , have links with the city ' s ills .	310.81274
both men are known to be honest and public-spirited .	1069.6969
mayor wagner ' s shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of mr . levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post .	849.92706
as mayor , mr . levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like .	709.52124
his election , on the other hand , would unquestionably strengthen the `` regulars ' ' .	366.80365
mr . wagner might or might not be a `` new ' ' mayor in this third term , now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls `` bosses ' ' .	199.26627
these are , of course , the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote .	366.65814
but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him .	458.57367
if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be made .	829.7732
the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party .	176.60066
both mr . k ' s have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos .	1719.7823
president kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refused thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow .	1334.7908
but at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting .	814.7368
and secretary rusk , en route to bangkok , doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai seato forces .	2847.7163
for mr . kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation .	578.24255
the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs .	2027.6621
he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says .	183.76897
in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr . khrushchev for the third time .	128.25862
at his press conference mr . kennedy said , `` all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn ' ' .	282.97568
at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position .	1176.1354
since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington , this approach might be expected to head off mr . khrushchev for the moment .	249.73897
but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos , the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot , but would bog washington in a tactical mess .	496.9969
as wars go , laos is an extremely little one .	656.42523
casualties have been running about a dozen men a day .	284.4317
the hard core of the pro-communist rebel force numbers only some 2 , 000 tough viet minh guerrilla fighters .	2656.4885
but for the united states and its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th ' -wisp terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners .	3239.4055
but if anything can bring home to mr . khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this braddock-against-the-indians contest , it will probably be the fact that seato forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington .	424.44125
fortunately both the republicans and america ' s chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president .	756.2109
actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table .	685.42285
it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable .	1058.5051
the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 , and last year washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma .	1710.3392
but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers .	1033.383
the road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation ' s terrain .	1386.747
but for the safety of southeast asia , and for the sake of the laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made .	467.2511
the world awaits mr . khrushchev ' s choice of alternatives .	43.37588
the senate ' s overwhelming ( 64-13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower house .	1386.7568
twice previously the senate has approved measures backing etv and the house has let them die .	1299.4258
but this year prospects may be better .	192.2096
the house communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds .	580.8103
this year ' s senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with $1 , 000 , 000 to be used in support of private , state , or municipal etv efforts .	415.09436
the funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation .	257.1108
the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value .	506.22568
but , lacking money from commercial sponsors , the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service .	788.96545
other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment .	527.69476
sam rayburn was a good man , a good american , and , third , a good democrat .	208.80038
he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure	2261.556
mr . speaker , mr . sam , and mr . democrat , at one and the same time .	61.48698
the house was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , speaker of the house , and second most powerful man in washington .	320.97226
mr . rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label .	629.1999
he was no flaming liberal , yet the new deal , the fair deal and the new frontier needed him .	310.94928
he was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any .	2106.9097
two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word .	491.1997
sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction .	460.49622
it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs .	516.05237
the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical .	4779.999
his leadership was not for audiences .	604.326
a growl , a nod , was usually enough .	1044.6772
when it was not , one of the great dramas of washington would be presented .	133.21278
he would rise in the well of the house , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence .	496.64178
he spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes .	2295.3538
he made good , plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it .	850.1553
these public efforts were rare because mr . rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor .	1245.1399
he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them .	274.7759
with his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader .	221.73701
he was , of course , in the house for a very long time .	81.38216
there are only two men remaining in congress who , with rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917 .	553.18365
to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr . sam coincided with that of the house .	169.60252
and it was the house he loved .	387.64856
to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition .	88.45512
the senate to him was not the `` upper body ' ' and he corrected those who said he served `` under ' ' the president .	234.29323
he served `` with ' ' him .	48.567314
sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death .	389.97833
woodrow wilson , with whom he began his years in washington , warren g . harding , calvin coolidge , fdr , with whom he managed a social revolution .	619.1772
and those still with us , herbert c . hoover , harry s . truman , dwight d . eisenhower and john f . kennedy .	280.01465
he was a fighter for those of his own party .	170.94489
mr . truman has only to recall the `` hopeless ' ' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr . kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr . sam been there .	259.76657
as it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration .	382.3144
with republican presidents , he fought fair .	425.5455
he was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist .	768.78595
he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play .	332.26077
under any name -- mr . speaker , mr . democrat , mr . sam -- he was a good man .	45.93843
thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends .	1097.1954
in 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle .	1329.5382
simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river .	927.1555
the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries .	669.0185
in other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga .	1802.509
does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ? ?	881.4594
to the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence .	1512.555
mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences .	2703.5073
yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga .	473.27362
it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it .	910.42017
the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ?	752.39185
the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa .	926.86383
right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga .	1288.2216
that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view .	1113.1938
the un army is too weak , too demoralized for the task .	891.60065
further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned .	1876.305
last , it makes no sense to deliver katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos .	516.23865
the congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence .	324.47778
the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom .	9113.262
it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism .	909.5762
but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach .	327.27588
otherwise , un will march blindly on to certain defeat .	1881.5221
a recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific co . and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information .	447.49008
the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours ' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year .	1102.444
our comment was that this was `` featherbedding ' ' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement .	508.81387
the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life .	488.30298
additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need .	1429.8783
also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic .	2571.8635
the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries .	469.1004
the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands .	341.17093
time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side .	490.72818
but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in st . louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there .	434.02887
it was , the brief writers decided , `` man ' s best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world ' ' .	604.2678
peace , it ' s wonderful , and `` world law ' ' , it ' s wonderful , too , and shouldn ' t we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? ?	270.44662
meanwhile , in moscow , khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can ' t see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism .	755.2811
a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st . louis to the moon , where there wouldn ' t even be any beer to drink .	477.13043
while he was at it , the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can ' t appreciate coexistence thru suicide .	1080.05
`` fools ' ' , he bayed , `` what do you think you are doing ' ' ? ?	139.79059
the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren ' t playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort .	296.60193
another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun .	1283.367
the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana , where , for some unknown reason , castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old ten o ' clock shadow .	933.46674
the plane was sent back to the united states , for a change , but castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution .	311.98904
less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castro ' s right hand man , che guevara , who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas , venezuela .	2282.6562
the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen , who were on hand to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium .	1245.8223
perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes , but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests , these things would not happen .	584.5559
the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev .	737.25824
pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it ' s getting dark down here and we ' re minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away .	422.0817
the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month .	390.76648
the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car .	789.14075
by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines .	700.7824
the board ' s action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws .	2582.7446
word of dag hammarskjold ' s death in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe .	753.50946
as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously .	711.90466
it was on the eve of a momentous u . n . session to come to grips with cold war issues .	265.3528
his firm hand will be desperately missed .	741.6329
mr . hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace .	155.51466
he had sought talks with moise tshombe , the secessionist president of congo ' s katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody .	4714.3276
the story of the fatal crash is not fully known .	1222.6257
the u . n . -chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired .	3506.8806
whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined .	295.6481
the death of mr . hammarskjold removes the united nations ' most controversial leader .	365.62494
he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice .	273.7892
he courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc .	299.72592
the congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs .	339.23126
his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape .	1053.6793
when the recent katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr . hammarskjold , despite the danger , flew to exert a calming influence .	1392.6646
he gave his life for his beliefs .	144.2964
the u . n . session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing .	359.74744
it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments .	366.58856
if the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice .	534.88666
that is the hope of mankind .	52.60089
reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of greater miami ' s hardest tasks .	439.07578
too many have bogged down in bickering .	1786.869
even when public bodies arrived at a consensus , at least one dissenting vote has been usual .	542.1663
so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity .	693.19464
all nine members of the inter-american center authority voted for goodbody & company ' s proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center .	1276.6615
the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract .	619.1981
if the indenture is accepted , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue .	963.7031
then goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15 . 5 million for developing the spacious graves tract to house the center .	590.4653
the next step awaits approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade county port authority .	919.20105
they allotted $500 , 000 three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arranged .	546.845
less than half the sum has been spent , since the interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations .	2963.11
the balance is being budgeted for the coming year .	829.1795
unanimity on interama is not surprising .	424.63092
it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed .	921.7455
the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8 . 5 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project .	413.02795
so have the people ' s elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels .	216.15022
interama , as it rises , will be a living monument to greater miami ' s ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises .	386.56082
a short report and a good one	242.51038
progress , or lack of it , toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the united states commission on civil rights .	406.75815
much happened in this field during the past 12 months .	240.9289
each state advisory committee documented its own activity .	4489.43
some accounts are quite lengthy but florida ' s is the shortest of all , requiring only four paragraphs .	843.65155
`` the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas ' ' , reported this group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south floridians , william d . singer and john b . turner of miami .	668.73303
`` no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group .	507.8194
`` the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights ' ' .	380.11453
problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint .	546.45917
the progress reported by the advisory committee is real .	407.61108
while some think we move too fast and others too slowly , florida ' s record is a good one and stands out among the 50 .	506.1656
west germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on berlin and unification , with a coalition government .	734.0027
this is the key fact emerging from sunday ' s national election .	966.2772
chancellor adenauer ' s christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 .	803.54987
in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength .	343.75842
the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired .	505.68887
both willy brandt ' s social democrats , who gained 22 seats in the new parliament , and the free democrats , who picked up 23 , will insist on that before they enter the government .	291.58694
moon-faced ludwig erhart , the economic expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him .	1688.9001
if he becomes chancellor , dr . erhart would make few changes .	1125.4767
the wizard who fashioned west germany ' s astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise .	1006.858
he is dedicated to building the nation ' s strength and , as are all west germans , to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany .	406.78104
what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result .	347.94223
if the party of adenauer and erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of willy brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve .	490.54547
west berlin ' s mayor brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it .	1086.6825
the free democrats ( 12 per cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union , and more dealings with the communist bloc .	359.287
the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility .	2660.5527
it could go either way , since the gains for both points of view were about the same .	186.87744
regardless of the decision two facts are clear .	991.7947
west germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations .	1171.3154
and the career of konrad adenauer , who upheld germany ' s tradition of rock-like leaders which bismarck began , draws near the end .	2274.345
americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing .	3709.0273
but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn ' t want to make a spectacle of himself .	200.92023
for instance , so-called `` conservative ' ' organizations , some of them secret , are sprouting in the garden of joining where `` liberal ' ' organizations once took root .	399.23212
one specific example is a secret `` fraternity ' ' which will `` coordinate anti-communist efforts ' ' .	219.07043
the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled .	934.254
according to the chicago tribune news service , state atty . gen . stanley mosk of california has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1 .	1164.2614
does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ? ?	884.51324
does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ? ?	1692.0575
does it put the label of un-american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically ? ?	2499.4675
does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars , communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ? ?	697.78046
does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ? ?	1213.8895
do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate ? ?	437.3329
in some instances a seventh question can be added 7 .	488.18915
does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system ? ?	473.8813
if the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time .	633.26117
falling somewhere in a category between einstein ' s theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless -- is the tropical green `` city ' ' of islandia , a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents , limited access and an unlimited future .	1269.3779
the latter is what concerns us all .	1254.3027
whatever land you can see here , from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward , belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land .	957.1625
and what you can ' t see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too .	319.27756
the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment .	544.1946
in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours .	1619.3761
in this instance , happily , insistence is being made that our share is protected .	806.93805
and until this protection is at least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing .	656.4024
the reaction of certain city council members to california ' s newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing .	1367.0714
we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide , and , therefore , had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public .	377.23685
in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the brown act , the legislature declares that `` the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people ' s business .	611.13214
it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly .	731.36115
`` the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them .	446.844
the people , in delegating authority , do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know .	350.81033
the full implementation of these noble words , however , has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature .	171.64359
since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted , but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act .	964.8623
despite the lip service paid by local governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations .	2728.2576
when all else fails , it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations .	1253.2468
we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims .	206.39415
without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily .	2080.051
but the citizens would , of course , never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious .	555.5532
if the dominican republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the u . s . show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship .	430.58716
outwardly , ciudad trujillo is calm .	192.15854
none of the trujillo family remains .	470.27267
mr . balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .	523.98456
had u . s . warships not appeared off the dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war .	743.1767
ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba .	804.2951
within the organization of american states , there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously .	474.96103
but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo ' s waterfront shouting , `` vive yankees ' ' ! !	1106.629
more , the u . s . action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , dr . juan bosch , as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future ' ' .	304.66476
mr . balaguer ' s troubles are by no means over .	308.13437
he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike .	1454.1877
in cooperating toward that objective , oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states .	773.57336
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 .	1196.7019
now , as then , it is a matter of jobs .	80.97722
craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim , such as factory maintenance .	485.8735
the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members .	733.14075
that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations .	260.9374
or that ' s what it looked like at the time .	123.383286
but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs .	2945.1516
walter reuther , leader of the industrial union faction of the afl-cio , says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor .	418.9021
whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as , say , jimmy hoffa of the teamsters , is a matter of conjecture .	862.2389
but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor .	1129.0382
engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor ' s family feuds .	459.44806
the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive .	349.30872
the army , navy and air force , among others , may question secretary freeman ' s claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the `` strongest deterrent ' ' to the spread of communism .	237.3801
but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the `` greatest single source of strength ' ' in the struggle to insure freedom around the world .	171.3343
mr . freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america ' s capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the soviet ' s successes in space .	436.28104
this shouldn ' t surprise the secretary	740.1106
american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time .	293.32303
in fact , over the years , the american farmer ' s capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar .	424.9297
and thus far , mr . freeman has offered very little relief .	227.25832
the 1961 feed grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a billion dollar fiasco .	1161.0967
in exchange for higher price supports , growers pledged reduction in planted acreage .	9439.906
but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer .	969.22455
the result $1 . 1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget .	241.36908
perhaps , as mr . freeman says , american agriculture may stop the communists , but it is also swindling the american taxpayer .	370.34302
a senate subcommittee headed by sen . jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions .	337.46753
the department needs a clearer `` sense of direction ' ' at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , sen . jackson says .	269.5683
the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department .	234.45943
president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance .	426.8881
but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first of all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes .	2207.3464
nor does sen . jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy .	549.8742
this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates .	871.41113
but competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what sen . jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them ' ' .	481.67514
the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr . rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged , as sen . jackson puts it , `` in work that does not really need doing ' ' .	269.69226
mr . rusk should also draw comfort from sen . jackson ' s recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved .	852.7464
self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress .	816.3951
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist .	879.6347
but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends .	763.4546
james p . mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn ' t drop below three million a couple of years ago .	269.6835
he lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora .	1068.3888
his successor , secretary goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months .	416.80704
no betting man , mr . goldberg says he ' s merely `` putting my neck out again ' ' by predicting the rate will go down this month .	413.90787
he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods .	835.4528
mr . mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated .	2954.2349
mr . goldberg has less reason for missing .	2276.159
the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can ' t be blamed in november .	611.12134
the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary ' s neck may be spared .	227.44815
cambodia ' s chief of state , who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand , insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia .	1312.045
but so convinced of communism ' s inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel .	459.57822
`` i have to see the facts ' ' , is the way the prince puts it .	126.871765
and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western posture .	4331.903
prince sihanouk ' s powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions .	787.80273
commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington ' s economic forecasters .	498.2752
weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement .	743.55206
recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr . hodges ' appraisal , though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house .	385.14557
and now mr . hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point .	546.114
he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .	289.97632
the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales .	557.29504
february ' s volume was 1 per cent above january ' s for the first pickup since last october , although it ' s still 1 . 5 per cent off from february 1960 .	741.0641
corroborating mr . hodges ' figures was the federal reserve board ' s report of the large sales increase in the nation ' s department stores for the week ending march 4 .	243.70413
in newark , for example , this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level .	401.56998
of course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 .	414.52707
another optimistic sign , this one from the labor department , was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments `` was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb . 25 ' ' .	358.44473
initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8 , 100 in the week ending march 4 .	374.8701
mr . hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn ' t think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes .	171.18233
well , we can ' t have everything .	902.38116
prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut .	397.0748
new jersey folk need not be told of the builder ' s march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain .	463.47678
now the stone harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state .	2127.0115
against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline , the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant .	2699.7996
but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves .	787.0003
the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30 , 000 acres of cape cod , from provincetown to chatham , is strengthened by president kennedy ' s interest in that area .	486.16507
but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country .	310.55408
by comparison , stone harbor bird sanctuary ' s allies seem less formidable , for aside from the audubon society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle egrets and the louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there .	1263.7045
but there is hope , for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space .	1016.0278
the desirability of preserving such places as the cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .	1289.4137
public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing .	1507.6903
but that heritage is shrinking even faster .	6050.6157
much of the glamor president kennedy ' s peace corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent shriver , the head corpsman .	487.4929
anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to mr . shriver , get off the train right now .	525.8237
first of all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling .	947.8575
it will be a 16-hour training day .	7212.67
then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different .	534.42957
and the pay , of course , will be nil .	187.0784
despite all this , the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else .	1238.3425
the study of the st . louis area ' s economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st . louis survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois countryside .	605.56116
st . louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region .	1477.607
slackened regional demand for st . louis goods and services reflects the region ' s relative lack of purchasing power .	257.65314
not all st . louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood .	364.69983
but for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core .	381.89005
the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois .	3669.457
gov . dalton ' s new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry .	693.97614
another would be to take the advice of dr . elmer ellis , president of the university of missouri , and provide for an impartial professional analysis of missouri ' s economy .	313.37088
he says the state , in order to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy .	383.75873
the research center of the university ' s school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr . ellis has been talking about .	231.51416
he and dean john w . schwada of the business school outlined the project at a recent conference .	661.7721
the university can make a valuable contribution to the state ' s economic development through such a study .	211.15147
in southern illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth .	958.5011
the carbondale industrial development corp . has obtained a $500 , 000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs .	1083.6514
carbondale is in the herrin-murphysboro-west frankfort labor market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average .	3341.1838
the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri ' s depressed areas , and in the long run that will benefit st . louis as well .	186.47029
politics-ridden st . clair county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development .	965.8571
more industrial acreage lies vacant in st . clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st . louis area .	297.07184
the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side .	2376.4932
and then there is st . louis county , where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth .	400.5833
st . louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests .	998.2345
some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st . louis county doesn ' t want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lost .	226.8203
metropolitan st . louis ' s relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi .	302.14914
without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area ' s economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and st . louis will slip into second-class status .	280.19843
many of our very best friends are reformers .	1526.2831
still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far .	341.4056
take , for example , the reformers among new york city ' s democrats .	294.88263
having whipped mr . de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall , they have changed the name to chatham hall .	565.38354
even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick ? ?	352.3473
granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame , the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit .	919.7658
but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name .	1324.0056
after all , it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-american , the days in which the sons of st . tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the british government , that is .	324.01825
further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ? ?	3848.8232
they will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant .	781.6868
instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger ' s stripes are not black ? ?	345.45374
the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official , col . mariano faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration service .	1371.6016
the faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds .	638.87915
the kennedy administration had assured anti-castro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator batista .	1981.0494
using a batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro .	1243.9003
moreover , col . faget ' s information on cuba was too outdated to be useful in `` screening ' ' castro agents	1105.123
the colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power .	1056.7914
and while he had headed batista ' s anti-communist section , the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be communists .	1073.2533
responsibility for the faget appointment rests with gen . j . m . swing , an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service .	471.66995
gen . swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office .	391.7807
his official term expired last summer .	614.6101
some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend , congressman walter of pennsylvania , at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get .	973.17065
congressman walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 .	955.43146
at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen . swing .	599.8324
the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat .	369.08078
as president , dwight d . eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics .	1291.022
as a former president , however , mr . eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new york republican rally , and generally missed his target .	714.0738
mr . eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a `` juvenile experiment ' ' and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon .	348.6815
nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad .	578.2875
his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding .	1094.7898
the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of `` dollarette ' ' dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies .	1171.7327
it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit .	2290.981
finally , mr . eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington .	410.5204
this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis , when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too .	674.91614
the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded .	1733.4469
ex-presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words .	740.9895
some of former president truman ' s off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein .	1217.4644
nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics , but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility .	324.76492
this is a matter of respect for the presidency .	77.16303
mr . eisenhower ' s new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship .	394.91388
the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable british service on the high seas .	500.2905
reports that the venerable liner , which has been in service since 1936 , was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us .	397.71417
but the cunard line , influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least .	677.4746
a new queen , with the prosaic title of q3 , had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary .	689.93097
the british government , concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry , had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling $50 , 400 , 000 toward the $84 , 000 , 000 cost of a new 75 , 000-ton passenger liner .	843.0761
since 1957 , more and more trans-atlantic passengers have been crossing by air .	1650.3434
economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines .	1388.4766
competition from other steamship lines has cut cunard ' s share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run .	703.2364
the cunard line has under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than 75 , 000 tons .	1874.7455
this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months .	833.7007
also under consideration is an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to serve new york .	1719.8735
the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation .	471.06152
gen . maxwell taylor ' s statement in saigon that he is `` very much encouraged ' ' about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to bolster the vietnamese army .	790.8566
gen . taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and , judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east , he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources .	309.324
there was good reason for gen . taylor to make an inspection trip at this time .	364.75375
communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a new crisis .	948.9166
south viet nam ' s rice surplus for next year -- more than 300 , 000 tons -- may have been destroyed .	403.1913
the viet cong , the communist rebels , may have lost their stored grain and arms factories .	655.56506
the rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in november .	945.72253
nothing that is likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions .	600.24786
the indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 , when gen . ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing .	537.4938
it is a war to stay out of today , especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops .	573.58673
he may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming .	245.39404
south viet nam has received $1 , 450 , 000 , 000 in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b . johnson ' s visit last may .	309.37857
gen . taylor , the president ' s special military adviser , is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure .	481.18045
it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an asian morass .	266.06387
gov . john m . dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly , or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence .	595.0677
ambassador stevenson yesterday described the u . n . ' s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced ' ' .	308.022
if the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as mr . stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill ' ' to a u . n . without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning .	356.18054
the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be , as the charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the organization ' ' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the organization ' ' .	406.92557
in other words , the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one .	322.92206
he should be , as dag hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .	302.7757
the charter does stipulate that `` due regard ' ' shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible ' ' .	257.18253
the united states and its allies have had no objection to this .	373.49265
what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold ' s death to turn the entire u . n . staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come .	245.92117
the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them .	187.3698
although the united states and the u . s . s . r . have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work .	196.76706
if any one of them has any power to veto the secretary general ' s decisions the nature of the organization will have changed .	305.40207
if they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the u . n . will not of necessity change .	380.85513
the secretary general must have , subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else ' s instructions .	397.26193
this is the root issue for which the united states should stand .	120.94429
we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography .	2124.7073
what we must have , if the united nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation ' s direction and subservient to no single nation ' s ambition .	333.92007
the new city charter , which should get a yes vote as question no . 1 on nov . 7 , would not make a good mayor out of a bad one .	270.61563
there is no such magic in man-made laws .	3653.708
but it would greatly strengthen any mayor ' s executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the board of estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy .	707.26654
lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor .	230.82205
thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative .	608.57227
the board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions .	1543.3093
the board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget items , subject to the mayor ' s veto	391.51157
but the city council will now share fully this budget-altering power .	2183.0464
overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council , and a two-thirds vote .	631.36163
the controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog ' ' functions	1780.8628
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed .	3026.7925
he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the finance department .	396.60703
on net balance , in spite of controller gerosa ' s opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office , the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now .	380.86258
borough presidents , while retaining membership in the board of estimate , lose their housekeeping functions .	966.48645
highways go to a new department of highways , sewers to the department of public works , such street cleaning as borough presidents now do ( in queens and richmond ) to the sanitation department .	841.4704
the expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department .	869.14703
the capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises	2347.8533
but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds .	1993.0096
a road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected .	1217.0841
this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business	6190.6294
it will also correct some injustices .	5046.6973
enlargement of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow .	403.7092
the inter-american press association , which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn , is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years .	482.85968
the i . a . p . a . is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere	93.370445
and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution .	273.33527
as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime , more and more cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile .	1374.1344
the i . a . p . a . found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before batista ' s dictatorship began in 1952 .	295.96503
freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances .	1165.1266
in such conditions all freedoms are lost .	1157.3567
this , in more diplomatic language , is what adlai stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government .	479.53516
he felt able to end on a note of hope .	178.09273
he sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms .	1343.7692
no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american press association .	200.36751
the twenty-second soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced .	1337.8329
according to the original program , premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the `` bold program for building communism in our time ' ' which the congress will adopt .	708.6168
but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by 1980 , the world is watching moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future .	734.68695
the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russia ' s progress painted by the communist party ' s program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier khrushchev ' s berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered .	578.1869
whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated .	398.5949
and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive .	931.0604
this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years .	1952.3245
the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress , and the central committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job .	638.6529
dr . james b . conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer .	3030.2297
his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change .	1283.209
now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including new york , has shattered this optimism .	569.6348
dr . conant has come away shocked and angry .	870.76855
his new book , entitled `` slums and suburbs ' ' , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster .	995.7476
there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr . conant ' s specific views .	279.51907
his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment .	444.83862
dr . conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality .	1621.5312
his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend .	1270.1984
but these are side issues to a powerful central theme .	531.3719
that theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk .	11891.014
it labels the slums , especially the negro slums , as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters .	754.71875
the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and dr . conant accuses employers and labor unions alike .	1098.2878
the facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools , regardless of the color of their students .	876.63196
a call for action `` before it is too late ' ' has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures .	518.2692
these warnings must not be treated lightly .	458.63968
dr . conant ' s conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation ' s gratitude .	598.1096
he has served in positions of greater glamour , both at home and abroad	918.8461
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools .	349.78293
a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail .	951.8917
he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers .	648.52527
in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress , each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district .	528.2824
this means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis .	1212.1149
letter writing is a dying art .	1194.2529
occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten .	854.3776
most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter .	1035.4364
old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery .	675.5607
she had , she said , heard that the plant was closing .	168.05853
it couldn ' t close , she said .	79.59154
she had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat .	8897.181
she had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear .	1005.73944
she was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter .	936.7302
she had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food .	196.94635
this did not happen in counties of north georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land .	593.53064
nor in south georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields .	684.43787
this happened in decatur , dekalb county , not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian atlanta .	667.6918
and now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the dekalb county cannery .	835.86414
`` is it so the cannery is going to close ' ' ? ?	75.2151
o . n . moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , didn ' t know what to say .	1396.7319
he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer .	611.1942
he did say he was out of cans , the no . 3 ' s , but `` i requisitioned 22 , 000 ' ' .	205.44594
he said he had no . 2 ' s enough to last two weeks more .	342.8716
threat of closing the cannery is a recent one .	470.78714
a three-man committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o . emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed .	1964.901
reason the cannery loses $3 , 000 yearly .	649.5091
but dekalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money .	290.08392
`` the cannery ' ' , said mrs . lewellyn lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the `` victory garden ' ' produce , `` is a service to the taxpayer .	546.4365
and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up .	686.6447
it helps those people who help themselves .	1399.9065
`` the county , though , seems more interested in those people who don ' t even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food ' ' .	431.79037
a driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a . m . finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , `` what in the world will we do ' ' ? ?	221.58409
`` what in the world ' ' , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , `` will any of us do ' ' ? ?	200.93604
moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn ' t believe it will close .	270.77127
but he is in the middle , an employe of dekalb , but on the side of the people .	161.22137
the old woman with the stew .	202.90172
`` don ' t ask me if i think the cannery helps ' ' , he said .	95.90213
`` sir , i know the cannery helps ' ' .	90.05556
most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard .	463.02634
when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say , `` just forget it ' ' .	553.8643
there is one thing i know	194.47595
a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge .	876.3649
i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades .	550.17346
several years ago i was his pastor .	278.38406
one night , at the close of the evening service , he came forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god .	240.37796
after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land .	366.82812
`` we tried to settle this dispute ' ' , he said , `` but could never come to an agreement .	76.13583
i settled it tonight ' ' , he continued .	33.533234
`` i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor ' ' .	343.09503
forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god .	180.80708
you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart .	1215.8713
henry van dyke said , `` forgive and forget if you can	452.0125
jesus made three things clear about forgiveness .	2214.3232
we must , first of all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure god ' s forgiveness .	190.79794
`` for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive -- your trespasses ' ' .	1363.4564
it will do no good to seek god ' s forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong .	521.5792
then , jesus indicated that god ' s forgiveness is unlimited .	319.34348
in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , `` forgive us our debts ' ' .	593.4814
when a person meets god ' s requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven .	362.00476
god ' s mercy and patience will last forever .	583.0485
forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by god ' s love .	2010.7596
it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past .	156.39343
we want the past forgiven , but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future .	202.48187
finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us .	411.99802
once peter asked , `` how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? ?	1081.1063
jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven ' ' .	476.63245
jesus not only taught forgiveness , he gave us an example of it on the cross .	213.81024
with all the energy of his broken body he prayed , `` father , forgive them , for they know not what they do ' ' .	311.25812
she ' s been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she ' s still a teen-ager who looks like a baby , she is getting married .	419.70328
her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said .	585.4533
for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldn ' t have made myself heard if i ' d had the equivalent of the message to garcia .	683.4787
but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute .	1139.0746
`` how do you know you love somebody enough to get married ' ' ? ?	173.96356
it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked how can you be sure ? ?	1081.1924
`` aren ' t you sure ' ' ? ?	42.069214
i asked , looking at her searchingly .	1545.3611
i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important .	391.87112
but if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage .	1337.5465
besides , in all honesty , i don ' t know how you can be sure .	58.798046
i don ' t know any secret recipe for certainty .	699.90717
in the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured .	5352.447
i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth .	240.71703
`` does he ever bore you ' ' ? ?	34.156094
why , he ' s so darling and ' '	92.01641
`` i mean ' ' , i went on ruthlessly , `` when he ' s not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting ? ?	290.3337
does he care about things that matter to you ? ?	195.79088
can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ? ?	452.06122
because , honey , i thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you ' re hopelessly stranded , together .	555.2294
and if you bore each other then , heaven help you .	892.85956
she came back the other day to reassure me .	1210.6113
she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting .	465.80334
she asked if i had other advice and , heady with success , i rushed it in , i hope not too late .	774.36316
jokes , cartoons and cynics to the contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends .	1473.1658
but i was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st . luke ' s church in atlanta .	360.3241
it was the cry of not just one heart	773.00073
it spoke for many in the clergy , i suspect .	94.1182
the pulpit is a lonely place .	880.95056
who stops to think of that ? ?	74.67887
imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church .	688.62976
`` such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments ' ' , he told his members .	350.1806
a minister should not stay `` beyond the time that his leadership should benefit ' ' his church , he wrote , `` for he becomes ordinary .	241.29507
and so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when `` i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you ' ' .	270.70184
his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister , a modest methodist , who said `` i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and i would have it no other way and it is unworthy to think of self .	338.33954
but oh , how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself ' ' .	138.92706
a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving .	273.9663
he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach .	294.69736
the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity .	1358.3713
theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards .	882.17596
yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul .	558.40857
we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and god ' s .	610.1108
we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week , american cash .	1279.6852
if we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins .	496.10593
if he won ' t break , we add to the stress he bears .	222.39938
and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to .	873.99365
we expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be .	222.45772
we expect bestowal of god ' s love through him .	158.46619
but how little love we give him .	187.75357
the church truly is not a rest home for saints , but a hospital for sinners .	520.9578
yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers , too .	938.02594
mr . podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake .	5761.2505
the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure .	1494.029
the evening was not always spent in the same way .	195.46318
this year , on a night cool with the front of september moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod .	690.8613
the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages .	320.60193
in the midst of it all , mr . podger came out on the pod porch , alone .	443.40787
he had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize .	884.60187
the prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging .	6579.7114
mrs . podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .	1764.4554
mr . podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it .	550.87225
he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him .	3626.976
suddenly one young voice rose above the others .	392.61307
`` but ' ' , it said , `` do you always know when you ' re happy ' ' ? ?	125.22188
the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in mr . podger ' s mind .	143.8724
here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , mr . podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace .	1060.2788
it had begun with the blue jay feather .	870.63696
walking along the lake before breakfast , mr . podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight .	278.67596
the winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood .	1180.7335
the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .	666.2882
all day long mr . podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield .	543.7098
would a blue feather in a man ' s hat make him happy all day ? ?	204.70667
but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake .	551.197
then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it .	572.3305
and there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road .	1067.4106
it was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr . podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car .	765.4021
would the driver see the turtle ? ?	156.81783
would he take pains to avoid it ? ?	77.297005
taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , mr . podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness .	937.8685
the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .	390.53812
but mr . podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .	388.22092
here in the cool darkness mr . podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight .	961.9021
where was the driver now ? ?	94.78692
for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .	328.86996
the three would never meet again , but for some reason or other mr . podger was sure he would always remember the incident .	245.88683
then there had been the auction itself .	1035.6646
at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr . podger ' s hammock purchase .	193.1575
`` i like them things , too ' ' , he had said .	40.13558
`` we got one at home .	137.81543
if you ' re lyin ' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap ' em right over you .	728.39417
i do it , lots o ' times -- i like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it ' s all quiet .	329.67606
the wind moves it a little bit -- you know .	184.65033
mr . podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice .	709.4164
as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , mr . podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet .	685.7106
alacrity , the podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up .	630.41943
she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and mr . podger took her inside the fringe .	855.01953
soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod .	3028.5454
mr . podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out .	878.6001
`` it ' s getting so chilly we ' ve lighted a fire , and we ' re going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one .	631.5808
we need you to start it .	192.73126
why are you out here all by yourself ? ?	398.079
mr . podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire .	969.1843
`` of course i am ' ' , he said .	32.99659
`` never happier in my life .	104.54481
i just came out here to know it ' ' .	57.039562
as the south begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region ' s slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools .	336.98962
desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities -- dallas and atlanta .	631.71216
in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment .	777.4117
these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully .	8414.816
the programs do not take sides on the issue itself .	171.90462
they point out simply that `` it is the law of the land ' ' .	30.247559
the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation .	619.08563
even better , they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs .	557.18774
in each case there was an initial act of violence .	205.48454
in nashville , a school was dynamited .	3779.668
in houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes , none of which were serious .	544.4347
in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents .	848.2598
the nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south .	512.8127
it is a `` stair-step ' ' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade .	254.05455
each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated .	1018.75323
the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now ' ' .	231.42213
the program has worked well in both nashville and houston .	569.79913
it met a serious rebuff in new orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents .	1052.1289
another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program .	242.24258
generally , throughout the south , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met .	369.10437
perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas .	1065.6504
during the summer , negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments .	8656.88
it was part of a citywide move toward full integration .	3192.1807
so successful has been this program , worked out by white and negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months .	481.7126
hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars .	109.76601
already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis .	1832.6274
several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .	1188.0597
this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of dallas .	907.1445
it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south .	368.4462
southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights .	512.17535
they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots .	2138.3728
all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it .	1383.4025
there are many causes for this change .	109.8391
one of the most important is economic .	271.22086
business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence .	1250.7198
they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .	482.64606
in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way .	222.7221
and as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up .	475.05594
this co-operation has emboldened other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation .	3067.2798
they realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise .	467.68085
since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago , i ' ve been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship .	674.4531
played mostly on the freeways around los angeles , it goes like this	236.1728
a driver cruising easily at 70 m . p . h . in lane a of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead .	1777.0337
traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into lane b , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m . p . h . .	880.22797
the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him .	1777.3481
he can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a	1708.4132
( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes	1899.1024
or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair .	1509.6917
the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access .	2295.252
whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , i don ' t know .	364.92386
but it is done , consistently and i ' m both surprised and impressed .	425.83334
this could never happen in my native chicago .	450.07816
there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood .	1791.9441
in chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back .	1041.3162
failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly .	1823.726
this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to southern california drivers .	1000.23083
at the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at marshall field and company , i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype .	1496.0122
after three months of research , i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i ' ve ever encountered .	1223.0468
during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .	967.8201
miami , fla . , march 17 .	165.4382
an out-of-town writer came up to paul richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year .	653.8015
now richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go .	680.7105
he can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa .	1795.5433
this happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece .	162.98582
`` it ' s a whole lot easier ' ' , he said , `` to increase the population of nevada , than it is to increase the population of new york city ' ' .	126.82186
and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher .	1212.7225
`` that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote ' ' , said the writer , scratching his head .	243.87816
`` now , if i can just figure out what he ' s talking about , i ' ll use it ' ' .	104.55398
this was just richard ' s way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open .	355.67902
some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs .	481.7319
it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it hasn ' t worked that way .	300.65448
this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one .	518.1761
you ' d never guess it from the way they ' ve played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 .	506.64926
obviously , if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league , it will have to show improvement someplace .	306.8782
where can that improvement possibly come from ? ?	543.0349
you certainly can ' t expect the infield to do any better than it did last year .	194.42987
brooks robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he ' ll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 .	120.20686
you can ' t expect it , though .	322.38312
robby ' s performance last year was tremendous .	245.29051
it ' s the same with ron hansen and jim gentile .	3227.1335
if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint .	183.38774
they shouldn ' t be asked to carry any more of the burden .	221.17914
hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back .	649.72565
he got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably won ' t duplicate it .	405.4062
there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year .	1237.7322
they don ' t expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat .	450.33664
he ' ll still be a top player , they concede , because he ' s got a great glove and the long ball going for him .	291.27594
but they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production .	1358.9512
gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs .	1518.6743
i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch .	7767.8325
but even so , he had a good year in 1960 and won ' t do too much better .	140.31844
so , all in all , the infield can ' t be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first .	392.4512
and the pitching will also have trouble doing better .	465.9655
richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season .	349.24692
where , then , can we look for improvement ? ?	176.46901
`` from triandos , brandt and walker ' ' , answers richards .	477.09314
`` they ' re the ones we can expect to do better ' ' .	73.92186
the man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons .	281.7167
triandos hasn ' t proved it yet , but he says he ' s convinced his thumb is all right .	326.7764
he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury hasn ' t bothered him .	182.99081
if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively .	438.50916
i ' m still not convinced , though , i ' ll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him .	217.63445
hank foiles , backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors , make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year , but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant .	830.7708
to me , brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year .	250.50694
he hasn ' t played too much , because richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice .	1599.6034
he ' s hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year .	272.68814
when he came to baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club .	345.64716
he was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field .	367.85022
as of now , that all seems behind him .	363.8398
he ' s been entirely different all spring .	933.0836
and walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year .	196.0733
let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff .	87.02958
so , if the orioles are to improve , brandt , triandos and walker will have to do it .	338.7089
so far the platoons on left and right fielders don ' t seem capable of carrying the load .	615.1695
of course , this isn ' t taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city , but it ' s the way things look from here at this point .	266.3557
is the mother of an `` autistic ' ' child at fault ? ?	189.71463
( the `` autistic ' ' child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self .	295.67023
he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people .	281.49112
) did his mother make him this way ? ?	156.08173
we believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn .	920.07245
a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties .	751.0684
sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them .	582.76666
but we don ' t think she creates them .	261.3021
we don ' t think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic .	3877.9666
the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem .	393.45438
since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we ' d like to share one experienced mother ' s comments .	302.9282
as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , i have to manipulate my son ' s fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy .	376.10458
he wants me to do everything for him .	179.33742
`` you don ' t believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them .	560.82776
but i do and my psychiatrist does , too .	1447.5509
i know , that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction .	680.0464
`` one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned .	7787.9785
this is that autistic people don ' t enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and i .	243.83955
when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board .	595.3047
he pushes and straightens himself as if he can ' t stand the feeling of being held .	148.04555
physical contact is uncomfortable for him ' ' ! !	22.69123
as a rule , the autistic child doesn ' t enjoy physical contact with others .	396.84424
parents have to find other ways of comforting him .	771.73566
for the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement .	509.28046
as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his `` magic ' ' thing ) .	269.2049
or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick .	1053.5397
the answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer .	212.35353
`` dear doctors we learned this year that our older son , daniel , is autistic .	422.26712
we did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to .	301.56638
fortunately , there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children .	197.15286
`` i try to treat daniel as if he were normal , though of course i realize he is far from that at present .	358.36047
what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible .	339.2041
i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible .	636.13385
`` what is your experience with autistic children ? ?	498.79556
how do they turn out later ' ' ? ?	30.586031
many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives .	922.4362
certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood .	485.02008
-- a first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything -- sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc . .	892.96387
when different colors are used , she is just as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc . .	804.02704
the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color .	836.1264
should i show my daughter how things should be colored ? ?	522.2472
she is an aggressive , nervous child .	387.4684
is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? ?	1272.2137
-- her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects .	1126.1224
this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade .	675.8066
no , coloring isn ' t exactly something you teach a child .	165.96538
you sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines .	478.86313
but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration .	753.86926
seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art embroidery .	552.88275
possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed .	1183.2078
just as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery .	763.0834
one such , in fact , is a rug .	141.20947
though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background .	1611.6536
the twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england .	2837.8699
traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country .	338.5973
the work is executed in england ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color .	247.59966
among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color .	2370.4802
for a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine english chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically chinese-inspired design of this revered eighteenth century period .	3560.6218
since the work is done by hand , the only limitation , it is said , `` is that of human conception ' ' .	105.26639
modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of this trend .	282.3087
these have never gone out of style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts .	2189.0776
an amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking up her living room color scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room .	842.78394
california democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards .	1759.8021
they seem darned proud of it .	55.937088
and they ' re confident that the gop , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine .	1133.4106
their meeting at san francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the california democratic council directorate .	1351.5912
but it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people ' ' .	945.71124
out of this session may come 1	503.75415
-- plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in los angeles next december that would enlist top-drawer democrats from all over the country .	1512.0287
-- blueprints for doubling the cdc ' s present 55 , 000 enrollment .	481.12033
-- arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in fresno next jan . 26-28 .	28723.434
-- and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state ' s 38 new congressional districts .	673.1541
at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox , 39-year-old amateur politico , thomas b . carvey jr . , whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircraft ' s moon missiles .	1252.5323
he ' s approached his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion .	3196.6863
viewed from afar , the cdc looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so .	2382.0862
much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer ' ' democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the aj .	622.43665
moreover , the entire state democratic hierarchy , from gov . brown on down to the county chairmen , also participates in this huge operation .	773.74164
contrarily , republican `` volunteers ' ' go their separate ways , and thus far have given no indication that they ' d be willing to join forces under a single directorate , except in the most loose-knit fashion .	589.2112
carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase cdc membership .	938.09796
where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth .	744.8452
biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting up cdc units in rock-ribbed democratic territory .	1460.5449
paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party ' s favor , strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis .	1865.9865
like most democratic spokesmen , carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously `` partisan year ' ' .	394.8062
hence the attention they ' re lavishing on the aj .	342.4744
in all probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress , and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites .	1047.2593
this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who don ' t see eye-to-eye with the aj .	793.72107
naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council .	419.39597
shunted aside by the rampant organizers for john f . kennedy last year , who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential campaign , the cdc plainly intends to provide the party ' s campaign muscle in 1962 .	733.848
there is evidence that it will be happily received by gov . brown and the other constitutional incumbents .	394.8126
carvey considers that former vice president nixon would be brown ' s most formidable foe , with ex-gov . knight a close second .	1276.1576
but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants don ' t worry him very much .	547.28845
in his cdc work , carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of california ' s shrewdest political strategists former democratic national committeeman paul ziffren , who backed him over a northland candidate espoused by atty . gen . stanley mosk .	3369.3164
( significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw mosk moving into the national committee post over ziffren are still audible in party circles .	4229.771

for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated dr . freud , communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves .	1480.805
they accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty .	368.30145
president kennedy ' s latest warning to the communist world that the united states will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was , somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the iron curtain .	938.9071
then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency .	2108.788

`` president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals , to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism .	718.01807

`` the american press clamored for many days promising president kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the united states .	1128.3525
in fact , the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current president .	730.37866
if there were no west berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the united states and its nato partners .	1165.3344

`` a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech .	195.13734
kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty .	580.0763
whenever some washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn .	998.08167
in kennedy ' s speech are cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the president ' s advisers and the political and economic forces behind them .	729.82446

the `` west berlin ' ' crisis is really an east berlin crisis .	625.2639
the crisis was artificially stirred up by the kremlin ( wall street ) and the red army ( pentagon ) egged on by the west germans ( east germans ) .	1859.5327
the reason was to speed up domestic production in the ussr , which khrushchev promised upon grabbing power , and try to end the permanent recession in russian living standards .	983.66644
chairman khrushchev ( kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position .	820.4545
his advisers in the politburo ( white house ) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions , so he is not always consistent .	739.90314

aug . 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after benjamin franklin founded the pennsylvania gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening post .	1291.5558
the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c . atkinson and charles alexander , who had just taken over franklin ' s old paper , desired a more distinctive name .	898.0174
when founded by franklin the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction , poetry , and literary essays .	811.162
in the middle of the century , with a circulation of 90 , 000 , the post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country .	140.52621
but during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 cyrus h . k . curtis purchased it -- `` paper , type , and all ' ' -- for $1 , 000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany , and with only some 2 , 000 subscribers .	951.55774
little more than a fine old name , valuable principally because of the franklin tradition , the saturday evening post was slow to revive .	980.59705
but curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country .	373.92764

the 350th anniversary of the king james bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament , the first part of the new english bible , undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english .	436.35428
since it was issued in the spring of 1611 , the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible .	441.23438
however , biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced .	2999.2678
this resulted in revisions of the king james bible in 1881-85 as the english revised version and in 1901 as the american standard version .	1043.989
then in 1937 america ' s international council of religious education authorized a new revision , in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages .	458.83612
undertaken by 32 american scholars , under the chairmanship of rev . dr . luther a . weigle , former dean of yale university divinity school , their studies resulted in the publishing of the revised standard version , 1946-52 .	998.5187
the new english bible ( the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version , but , as its cover states , it is offered `` simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship ' ' .	375.987
time , of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose .	453.93573
bible reading , even more so than good classical music , grows in depth and meaning upon repetition .	1027.141
if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the king james version .	304.68018
however , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars .	392.65204
one is impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english , and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james .	360.12436
for example , in the third chapter of matthew , verses 13-16 , describing the baptism of jesus , the 1611 version reads	2828.8342
`` then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .	768.5026
`` but john forbad him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ? ?	326.62903
`` and jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness .	1403.6227
`` and jesus , when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove , and lighting upon him ' ' .	420.13217
certainly , the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings , in the new english bible which reads `` then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee , and he came to john to be baptized by him .	494.65863
' do you come to me ' ? ?	184.36456
' i need rather to be baptized by you .	204.0647
jesus replied , ' let it be so for the present	357.18213
we do well to conform this way with all that god requires .	530.64825
john then allowed him to come .	37.332016
after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once , and at that moment heaven opened	329.68344
he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him ' '	845.34283
( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version .	974.69476
among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes and yet so few persons , other than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount .	985.0591
to illustrate , the first blessing in the king james bible reads `` blessed are the poor in spirit	1842.533
for their ' s is the kingdom of heaven ' ' .	65.70556
the new version states `` how blest are those who know that they are poor	805.3727
the kingdom of heaven is theirs ' ' .	48.217392
some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the english language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar .	400.73444
to a novice that is significant .	287.18365
in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase `` angel of the church ' ' which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop .	1114.1517
for the most part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ .	262.6878
originally recorded by hand , these words have been copied and recopied , translated and retranslated through the ages .	1669.7653
discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church fathers , in themselves called for a restudy of the bible .	611.4435
to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth .	705.97
there is one danger , however .	109.45674
with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic .	613.3401
the only answer will be continuous study .	154.04192
the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england , church of scotland , methodist church , congregational union , baptist union , presbyterian church of england , churches in wales , churches in ireland , society of friends , british and foreign bible society and national society of scotland .	317.31332
prof . c . h . dodd , 76 , a congregational minister and a leading authority on the new testament , is general director of the project and chairman of the new testament panel .	347.8656
sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet .	1480.3066
that is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes .	1131.7186
there are many soft and light shoe leathers available .	4246.949
many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers .	12329.479
softness is found in crushed textures .	41915.53
styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape .	6370.1816
heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette .	4575.388
wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights .	570.97687
stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes .	4598.1865
just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps .	1003.9709
while white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color .	2880.8394
in the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures .	2208.2527
don ' t overlook the straws this year .	470.0191
they come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors .	2463.4722
in the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles .	3980.306
for added comfort some of the italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning .	32717.21
the citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot .	976.6856
orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac .	2698.0222

an electric toothbrush ( broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the american bathroom .	689.21844
the brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth .	364.43747
in addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the underwriters laboratories , which means it is safe .	470.43637
the unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in .	450.96796
the speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor .	1926.0107
the brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own .	927.1604
most of us brush our teeth by hand .	456.12982
the same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men .	2174.071
the electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend .	2349.383
in addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth .	1440.52
the bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel .	4280.4873
it is conceivable that broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly .	1991.8865
several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device .	959.9804
the results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly .	1252.9033
the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy .	1339.7671
but for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury .	875.49274
it is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles .	1606.437
since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique .	731.14355
writes does numbness in the left hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain tumor ? ?	772.0721
this is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand .	575.7971
the pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand .	475.51123
writes do steam baths have any health value ? ?	492.08984
no , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder .	5642.2793
an ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same .	318.05057
writes what makes my hands numb when sewing ? ?	7157.0327
there are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders .	829.99274
this manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer ' s cramp .	1769.6703
writes does a brace help in sciatica ? ?	292.42474
a back brace might help , depending upon the cause of sciatica .	377.9279
writes does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ? ?	374.68387
the cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body .	130.08856
it is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish .	1475.9366
the latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed .	202.69527
the gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue .	2243.6492
there ' s more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as thomas alva edison ' s first experiment in recorded sound .	1363.8009
edison could hardly have guessed , however , that sophocles would one day appear in stereo .	2366.2136
if the record buyer ' s tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records .	804.8118
and he will avoid eye-strain in the process .	844.5958
everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable .	1770.0248
for sheer ambition , take the decca series titled modestly `` wisdom ' ' .	1294.4956
volumes one and two , selected from the sound tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise men of our day ' ' .	380.49283
these sages include poet carl sandburg , statesman jawaharlal nehru and sculptor jacques lipchitz , in volume one , and playwright sean o ' casey , david ben-gurion , philosopher bertrand russell and the late frank lloyd wright in the second set .	2770.2874
hugh downs is heard interviewing wright , for an added prestige fillip .	9349.3545
there ' s more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by dover publications .	2665.4338
dover `` publishes ' ' what the company calls `` listen and learn ' ' productions designed to teach foreign languages .	495.43192
previous presentations have been on french , spanish , russian , italian , german and japanese .	275.7181
but the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist ' s desire to visit the `` smaller , less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries ' ' , and is now prepared to teach modern greek and portuguese through recordings .	606.77576
the respective vocabularies `` essential for travel ' ' are available in separate albums .	624.8314
thanks to spoken arts records , history buffs may hear lincoln ' s `` most memorable speeches and letters ' ' in a two-disc set , interpreted by lincoln authority and lecturer roy p . basler .	843.8684
as a contemporary bonus , the set includes carl sandburg ' s address at a joint session of congress , delivered on lincoln ' s birthday two years ago .	303.76828
for those who `` like poetry but never get around to reading it ' ' , the library of congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work .	440.4438
the program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the recording laboratory of the library of congress , washington 25 , d . c . .	148.13086
a catalogue is available on request .	164.63307
newest on the list are john ciardi , w . d . snodgrass , i . a . richards , oscar williams , robert hillyer , john hall wheelock , stephen vincent benet , edwin muir , john peal bishop and maxwell bodenheim .	2080.7156
two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above .	222.60233
decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction .	2022.1277
rca victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` adventures in music ' ' , which is an instructional record library for elementary schools .	500.9706
howard mitchell and the national symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two .	1422.2786
teaching guides are included with each record .	308.4147
in an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future , herbert a . leggett , banker-editor of the phoenix `` arizona progress ' ' , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties .	1596.7213
one of the roughest was the tv quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes .	3523.71
though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed american .	785.08575
but the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2 , 000 , 000 profit on the stock market .	720.0931
every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb .	625.96643
investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough .	1418.3418
people who take us for suckers are like the westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull ' s-eye achievements .	901.4135
the promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it .	173.69492
his answer was simple but honest .	571.10345
he just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull ' s-eye .	405.13214
one of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication .	364.34677
but explanations leave him confused and unmoved .	6295.9365
if his mother loves him , he clings to that love as a ballast .	452.2915
he wants mommy to think him a good boy .	213.88335
he doesn ' t want her to look frowningly at him , or speak to him angrily .	1439.1188
he wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother ' s little helper .	1177.2161
but even mother ' s loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior .	764.0566
his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother ' s love for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them .	202.65196
his own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed .	145.82915
it won ' t develop until he has words with which to clothe it .	543.43896
the conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old .	180.54733
what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ?	685.0948
she can decrease the number of temptations .	459.1073
the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be .	165.69464
she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child .	516.6835
if he can ' t play with mommy ' s magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own .	190.62016
if daddy ' s books are out of bounds his own picture books are not .	723.62744
toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .	784.0558
during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child ' s conscience .	121.7441
she tells him of the consequences of his behavior .	74.41312
if he bites a playmate she says , `` danny won ' t like you ' ' .	399.71307
if he snatches a toy , she says , `` caroline wants her own truck just as you do ' ' .	397.32727
there is no use trying to `` explain ' ' to a 2-year-old .	254.9696
remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior .	168.59222
substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act .	619.6243
he won ' t submit to his natural desires all the time , and it ' s mother ' s love that is responsible for his good behavior .	170.61012
this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` homecoming day ' ' .	523.34705
they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes .	1433.4308
the football opponent on homecoming is , of course , selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperor ' s lions .	394.14236
it is true , of course , the uncertainties of life being what they are , that as now and then the christian killed the lion , homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team .	339.15332
even with all possible precaution , homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them .	1847.1743
more often than not , as the old grad wanders along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain .	1524.4546
he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall .	974.85657
it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates , faces alight , holding hands and talking happily as they come along , oblivious of him , or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances , such as they would give a tethered goat .	1420.4432
usually , they titter loudly after they have passed by .	790.39966
he feels , suddenly , the weight of the fat that is on him .	115.168144
his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous .	3748.1162
his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walked for miles , instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths .	901.3959
bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth .	952.9558
it is not much better if he meets with old classmates .	1067.5791
too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by .	623.5581
he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said , on returning from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn ' t even recognize him .	480.99622
if they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon is done .	1413.9382
after all , when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children , and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it .	741.1885
by then one begins to notice the middle-age spread	4312.0073
the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that are too thin or too heavy	1286.9132
the fading signs of old beauty	2914.609
the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then , it is time to break it up and move on .	527.02484
it is , if anything , worse on the old player	731.8659
he sits in the stands and he doesn ' t like that .	74.90411
enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd .	329.1467
on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him .	254.03929
in the stands he is lonely and lost , no matter how many are about him .	420.30728
he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped	963.3329
the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants	1499.8872
the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face .	2787.512
he remembers the desperate , panting breath	28801.336
the long runs on the kick-offs	17735.242
the desperate agony of goal-line stands .	9147.281
and so , he squirms with each play , remembering his youth .	2243.14
no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recaptured again .	309.22107
since the obvious is not always true , the republican national committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities .	715.51685
of 40 cities with populations of 300 , 000 and more , mr . kennedy carried 26 and mr . nixon 14 .	351.11826
there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election .	247.31398
these are new york , pennsylvania , michigan , maryland , missouri , new jersey , illinois and minnesota .	259.0489
in 1952 mr . eisenhower won all but missouri .	536.1729
yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to mr . kennedy .	460.7286
republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia .	158.14401
mr . nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so .	526.1985
his visit to warsaw , poland , after the russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial .	255.30016
yet , the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr . nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` polish ' ' vote	259.32303
30 per cent of the `` irish ' ' vote , and 18 per cent of the `` negro ' ' vote .	76.615105
a gop `` task force ' committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities .	511.01974
the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders .	420.1097
these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr . kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment .	603.56744
this error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one ' ' , and not a reality .	132.29169
the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical .	841.4772
they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor goldberg as politics , which the gop declared it to be .	354.34863
the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery .	284.75998
senator mundt ' s gross distortion of president eisenhower ' s conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy as too left wing , a statement mr . eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case in point .	330.15082
if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities .	1145.0486
the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt , goldwater , bridges , dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s .	694.523
in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr . hoover , and the party ' s failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash .	408.32834
the republican party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble .	624.7212
farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` hoover carts ' ' .	598.14355
smokers reduced to `` the makings ' ' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` hoover dust ' ' .	327.7769
one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasn ' t meant to repeat this error .	526.7126
but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john f . kennedy .	807.4865
that this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nation ' s business .	292.80707
the most articulate republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at mr . kennedy , already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care .	345.31787
if they also defeat the school bill , the gop task force won ' t have much research to do .	489.23172
it will early know why the party won ' t win back city votes .	993.53656
the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider .	345.24033
the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner .	162.79257
after the griffin-byrd political troup has completed the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history .	452.14014
every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions .	1552.8474
hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever .	809.9541
and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor ' s race ' ' ? ?	247.18808
how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt . gov . garland byrd ' s senate committee on government operations ? ?	285.89194
the situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governor ' s race forward a few months , causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual .	596.9693
but when former gov . marvin griffin and lt . gov . byrd accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november , the situation was aggravated .	587.24524
neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation .	374.76108
to have refused would have been political suicide .	201.59987
and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast aside .	610.6399
the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates .	563.51056
it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the `` serious candidates ' ' .	204.68303
but state party chairman james gray of albany said no , and he didn ' t mince any words .	352.0123
`` they are just asking too much ' ' , he said .	78.69451
we can ' t think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either .	465.23242
`` if an opponent accuses you of lying , don ' t deny it .	377.43622
say he is a horse thief ' ' , runs an old adage .	1132.6953
if either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end .	621.7713
griffin ' s rural roads authority and byrd ' s 60 , 000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper ' s oaths .	751.58936
the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one .	643.0824
why not have them travel the state in november debating ? ?	504.56912
it would present a forum for them in almost every community .	464.77365
but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor ' s race being run in the next legislature , the spectre of big spending programs , the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin .	915.47296
there is a way out of this .	73.34879
the chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum .	3508.9817
it has arranged a campaign for governor .	391.07776
if it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring , and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates , it can provide a service to the state .	334.6811
but the legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race .	399.65704
former british prime minister attlee says eisenhower was not a `` great soldier ' ' .	317.52203
both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from british strategy .	2460.7063
congressmen returning from recess say the people admire president kennedy so much , they ' re even willing to heed his call to sacrifice -- and give up his program .	910.6238
slogan of the john birch society `` paddle your own canoe .	28097.23
the guy who makes the motor boats may be a communist ' ' .	128.43146
a republican survey says kennedy won the ' 60 election on the religious issue .	396.21463
too many people were afraid if the gop won , they ' d have to spend all their time praying .	631.6977
the providence journal editorial ( jan . 25 ) entitled `` east greenwich faces a housing development problem ' ' points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours .	718.8649
your suggested solution , it seems to me , is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning .	988.9621
first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested .	999.37756
this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town .	327.8258
the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come .	185.42377
this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither `` to halt an influx of migrants ' ' nor are we `` setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites ' ' .	882.00476
what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development .	792.56757
it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs .	1208.0885
bostitch , inc . is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax .	917.275
the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory .	605.66626
the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars .	713.8487
with our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant ' ' as the best way to meet these problems .	295.88828
in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure .	326.49155
as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow .	1988.0104
mr . richard preston , executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission , in his remarks to the governors conference on industrial development at providence on october 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said `` if this is the fundamental reason for a community ' s interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain ' ' .	323.5267
he went on to say `` in the first place , industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities .	748.94653
it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be ' ' .	476.11093
while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth .	472.9332
we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year .	486.27216
it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase .	533.5661
if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning , what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage ? ?	444.88422
where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials ? ?	561.36847
i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life .	359.0068
the `` fruitful course ' ' of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called .	672.75977
the east greenwich police department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department , thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut area of the two communities .	1683.9065
the east greenwich fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich .	984.8017
the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money , as do other kent county communities , for the support of the kent county memorial hospital , a regional facility .	788.81085
the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment .	1006.9593
feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick , as reported in your newspapers , suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east greenwich .	1091.1542
east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves .	237.01976
the education program for retarded children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community .	2104.9124
i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich .	349.96494
i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts	700.9786
and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised .	614.55646
these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in what manner the community shall grow .	826.42346
we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions .	901.0418
until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny .	1308.4194
i would like very much , on behalf of my husband and myself , to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the gabrielle fund .	657.0499
it is indeed true , as stated in the famous novel of our day , `` for whom the bell tolls ' ' , that `` no man is an island , entirely of itself	234.71805
every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main ' ' .	61.57227
thanks to the generosity of mr . irving j . fain , president of the temple beth el	1026.4796
rev . dewitt clemens , pastor of the mathewson street methodist church	2398.7473
mr . felix miranda , of the imperial knife co .	199.99086
and to mrs . rozella switzer , regional director of the national conference of christians and jews , who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund .	538.167
it is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man , and therefore , that most people are noble , helpful and good .	292.83026
bless you my friends , for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality .	299.51602
i am a sophomore at mount pleasant high school .	2884.5852
my future plans are to become a language teacher .	233.07588
of course , having this desire , i am very interested in education .	199.50813
a few weeks ago , i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston .	197.1508
the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over , and must not be going to high school to attend these classes .	370.84384
the following week , i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade .	439.29608
i wish you could see the situation as i see it .	135.4198
if russian pupils have to take these languages , how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language , but have to face so many exceptions ? ?	328.25284
i do not think that america is like russia , not in the least ! !	271.15735
i am proud of my country , the small city i live in , my wonderful parents , my friends and my school	417.47632
but i am also a young , able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough .	529.54565
then people wonder why russian pupils are more advanced than american students .	951.9957
well , there lies your answer .	792.11676
at the height of the first snowstorm we had , it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency .	276.07202
however , the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation .	998.1374
words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me .	942.2592
the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful .	228.06699
the rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather .	356.83844
had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did , perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time .	129.2303
many thanks for a job well done .	1122.9159
the providence sunday journal article ( jan . 29 ) asking whether american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news .	1245.8015
usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page .	557.4553
on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service .	671.16504
it can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later .	368.6634
there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter va hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected .	3989.7007
no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years .	137.70998
the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public .	1318.2823
i believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals .	2037.7533
but i don ' t believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients .	417.3774
this matter is of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at least serious injuries , for many veterans .	408.01733
some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long .	323.7378
there ' s a reason for this length of stay .	297.72943
first of all , the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient .	656.57263
he has no experience with this veteran ' s previous medical record .	309.30557
if the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient .	285.4868
as a result , it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient .	409.42545
secondly , the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital , he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient .	303.75208
so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery .	478.38318
the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization .	2544.5317
the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other .	500.52817
the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital .	335.62268
an adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals .	1558.6895
it seems that open season upon veterans ' hospitalization is once more upon us .	1028.8096
the american medical association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer .	1265.7446
do they , the a . m . a . , offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world ? ?	509.28406
we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness .	1128.7711
nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the a . m . a . on the health problem confronting the aged .	115.80821
they opposed the forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction	1195.7407
yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate .	1485.11
-- no doubt there have been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration , exasperation , exhaustion , and even panic .	647.1583
but no president ever before referred to his as a `` lousy job ' ' ( as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen . barry goldwater ) .	495.3684
during his aggressive campaign to win his present position , mr . kennedy was vitriolic about this country ' s `` prestige ' ' abroad .	203.5905
what does he think a remark like this `` lousy ' ' one does to our prestige and morale ? ?	267.38904
if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a `` lousy job ' ' , then heaven help us all .	256.939
-- defense secretary robert s . mcnamara has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars .	899.82715
why should congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection ? ?	478.47284
top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time .	893.1981
the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground , sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter .	1462.3986
this sum spent for foreign economic aid , the peace corps , food for peace , or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace , increased world trade , and prosperity for every country on the globe .	279.8498
let us prepare for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization .	155.52698
-- it seems college isn ' t what it should be .	53.547413
i refer to the attire worn by the students .	2299.6833
upon a visit to a local junior college last week , i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing bermuda shorts .	861.05035
is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years ? ?	194.14989
education should be uppermost in their minds , but with this attire how can anyone think it is so ? ?	269.92615
it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves .	688.8839
high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students .	305.32462
many high school students go past my house every day , and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen .	716.17535
no matter how hot the day , they are dressed properly and not in shorts .	446.29865
-- the granting of the jan masaryk award august 13 to senator paul douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities .	2089.0566
douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed masaryk , and against principles masaryk died to uphold .	1351.4043
douglas has voted for aid to communists and for the destruction of individual freedom ( public housing , foreign aid , etc . ) .	257.94092
-- in today ' s `` voice ' ' , the cta is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens .	351.52734
rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly , and i would be the last to say they should not receive consideration .	121.54398
but why is it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people ? ?	250.19704
why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should ? ?	1492.9856
the welfare of citizens , old and young , is the responsibility of the community , not only of that part of it that rides the aj .	183.36763
cta regulars already subsidize transportation for school children , policemen , and firemen .	701.878
-- in reply to a letter in today ' s `` voice ' ' urging the sale of meat after 6 p . m . , i wish to state the other side of the story .	108.13682
i am the wife of the owner of a small , independent meat market .	228.01935
my husband ' s hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a . m . to 7 p . m . the early part of the week , and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends .	179.49731
now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings -- and sundays , too , for this is coming .	240.64964
there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source , freezing it , and shipping it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required .	887.28864
if a customer wishes a special cut , it will not be available .	102.79627
we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged , whether we want it or not .	955.56177
most women , in this age of freezers , shop for the entire week on week-ends , when prices are lower .	819.98987
also , many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them .	10801.212
independent market owners work six days a week	541.0873
and my husband hasn ' t had a vacation in 14 years .	104.35484
no , we are not greedy .	9111.333
but if we closed the store for a vacation , we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block .	257.70758
the meat cutters ' union , which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area , represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets .	544.3272
what it is trying to do is to protect the little man , too , as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores , with choice of cut being made by the consumer , not the store .	252.4168
-- i , too , congratulate the american legion , of which i am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years , on the recent state convention .	387.8858
i regret that bertha madeira ( today ' s `` voice ' ' ) obtained incorrect information .	612.95795
had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege , the matter she raised would have been clarified .	234.95052
the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag .	563.7277
judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this .	246.07613
the resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag .	1976.806
it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and , without an amendment to the law , we could not enforce this .	323.73273
my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises , and not by innuendo criticize them .	1318.2648
at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties .	522.63135
-- the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children .	683.713
in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children , the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field .	755.0672
the illinois commission for handicapped children , which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children , of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois , and of promoting more adequate services for them , indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children .	528.87616
-- i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed your june 25 article on liberace , and to thank you for it .	565.72253
please do put more pictures and articles in about liberace , as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person .	621.37506
-- is this , perhaps , one of the things that is wrong with our country ? ?	144.30856
engineering graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the school ' s history -- $550 a month .	773.369
my son , who has completed two years in engineering school , has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer .	766.35754
at a rate of $3 . 22 an hour he is now earning approximately $580 a month .	1819.3839
ironic , is it not , that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer ? ?	593.4633
( editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page ) .	762.7185
-- your july 26 editorial regarding the position of attorney general robert f . kennedy on prospective tax relief for dupont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact .	935.1169
as a result , your criticism of attorney general robert f . kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair .	657.9086
the editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on dupont stockholders , in connection with the united states supreme court ruling that dupont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings .	1101.9999
these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that dupont stockholders might have to pay -- from an estimated 1 . 1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars .	625.23615
congressman wilbur d . mills , chairman of the house ways and means committee , asked the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law enforcement .	500.7292
the attorney general responded by letter dated july 19 .	751.08844
copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public .	745.29926
in this letter , mr . kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments .	597.6275
there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress , not the department of justice , to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation .	298.18622
yet your editorial said `` now the attorney general writes that no considerations ' justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' ' .	289.22302
what mr . kennedy , in fact , wrote was `` it is the department ' s view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' ' .	200.61952
the editorial , by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement , totally distorted mr . kennedy ' s views .	564.0138
the headline is offensive , particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial .	231.345
-- i concur most heartily with today ' s letter on the futility of writing to sen . dirksen and sen . douglas .	365.22574
but when you write to congresswoman church , bless her heart , your letter is answered fully and completely .	988.9008
should she disagree , she explains why in detail .	297.27972
when she agrees , you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged .	505.33646
i think we have the hardest working , best representative in congress .	580.9258
-- a recent news story reported that frank sinatra and dean martin delayed 103 airplane passengers 10 minutes in london while they finished their drinks .	3700.17
they do our country great harm by such actions .	1011.98175
those in the public eye should be good examples of american citizens while abroad .	452.01556
the plane should have started at the scheduled time and left sinatra and martin to guzzle .	1105.1161
-- overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation ' s main industries .	218.95837
in covert socialism -- toward which america is moving -- private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them .	2245.836
in order to attract new industries , 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise .	1483.1426
this is a step toward overt socialism .	4208.4614
issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions .	672.5625
sir -- we are writing in reference to a recent `` suggestion ' ' made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ) .	569.52405
the day before election day , to which we are entitled as a legal holiday , we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party ' ' .	213.92151
being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we felt this wasn ' t a function of our position .	245.61871
such tactics reek of totalitarianism ! !	2217.822
as we understand , this directive was given to all city and county employes .	598.28845
to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation .	932.31415
we , therefore , considered the `` suggestion ' ' an insult to our intelligence , ethics , bill of rights , etc . .	251.17075
our only obligation for this day is to vote , free of persuasion , for the person we feel is capable in directing the public .	339.5101
this is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the united states .	261.1079
sir -- i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters .	323.1955
does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready to demand that `` the community ' ' help and protect them ? ?	661.5522
community shelters are , of course , necessary for those having no space for shelter .	314.2758
if in a town of 2 , 000 private homes , half of them have shelters , the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent .	223.33476
in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home ' s occupants , `` plus-one ' ' -- so he will be able to take in a stranger .	230.89789
i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart , will get busy and be the first member of our `` plus-one ' ' shelter club .	265.934
sir -- people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space .	225.42798
it ' s simple enough from my point of view .	262.66275
it is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman ' s world .	152.69499
sir -- when the colonies decided upon freedom from england , we insisted , through the declaration of independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity .	412.24246
it is high time the united states began to realize that the god-given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga .	608.02576
in the united nations charter , the right of self-determination is also an essential principle .	460.88657
this , again , applies to katanga .	2580.0107
the people of katanga had fought for , and obtained , their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga , and his cohorts .	576.8736
by political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they were justified in doing so .	429.72116
the united states and the u . n . denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the katangans .	436.19034
sir -- permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to .	964.4424
the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny .	1320.2936
the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers .	739.6699
under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed	140.07657
the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate .	297.7213
this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college , and the director and two members of the board of freeholders .	91.50771
it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders , which `` shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed , levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes ' ' .	485.874
the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college .	196.12614
since two of these could be trustees of the college , actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue .	246.22931
sir -- your editorial , `` housing speedup ' ' , is certainly not the answer to our slum problems .	326.71002
the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions .	957.5231
change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties .	569.2384
then see what a boom in all trades , as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers , will happen .	760.0286
our entire economy will have a terrific uplift .	2072.6018
sir -- an old man is kicked to death by muggers .	1041.0585
the medical examiner states that death was due to `` natural causes ' ' .	126.19425
i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york , it is listed as `` death due to natural causes ' ' .	374.72174
sir -- every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit `` our changing skyline in newark ' ' .	535.9501
it will be at the museum until march 30 .	366.6786
it is a revelation of what has been done , what is being done and what will be done in newark as shown by architects ' plans , models and pictures .	359.1359
it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud of this city .	3625.2783
it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic , school and religious life of the community so that that phase of newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit .	507.94485
sir -- i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway .	588.1518
recently i traveled the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere .	1442.3689
one even gave my little dog a biscuit .	2600.369
the viewers of the `` deep peep show ' ' at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp .	1772.6685
twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encountered .	593.5845
this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing .	1905.847
the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay .	327.63077
some of the stumps are as much as three feet long , but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments .	408.05292
although the wood has been changed to coal , much of it still retains its original cell structure .	639.3287
in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time .	1317.3115
these microfossils indicate the swamp was `` formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing .	2058.7283
the 15th street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street reported in the washington post , august 2 , 1955 , which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger .	978.71216
recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air .	324.91855
while i respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that i would like to question .	255.80792
he said , `` let ' s work for peace instead of protection from aggression ' ' .	298.85608
i would ask , `` why not do both ' ' ? ?	67.16594
military power does not cause war	935.8244
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people .	606.48157
are we not late , especially those of us who call ourselves friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding ? ?	367.01572
as to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone .	909.1135
is this a reason for saving no one ? ?	301.487
would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone ? ?	1145.869
the speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face .	320.2855
if the world comes to this , wouldn ' t it be the very time when courage and american know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild ? ?	297.86404
many of our young people think it would .	1108.4907
lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it `` civilian defense ' ' .	961.91724
in 1950 , public law 920 created civil defense ( different from civilian-groups of world war 2 ) , a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade .	668.2192
far from creating fear , as the speaker suggests , preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence .	1300.4412
civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm , flood , accident or even war ? ?	389.4901
it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs .	460.23566
i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone ' s apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide .	676.3668
in addition , would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash ? ?	438.65408
i grant that the dog may not be really protective , based on his training , but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog ? ?	848.88495
i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments .	2223.6216
use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe ? ?	297.65234
could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal ? ?	183.96132
is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists ' comfort ? ?	616.3622
perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended .	2535.8208
the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak .	1765.0057
why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat ? ?	309.53708
unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season .	299.36984
as an added suggestion to balance the budget , the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument .	451.88214
it is visible throughout the city , and men from madison ave . would jump at the chance .	290.55435
sen . hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart .	227.03616
he , like most of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors .	220.82465
let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens .	3067.7476
let us , like the french , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd .	917.8105
two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee ( may 2 ) by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work .	717.1158
soviets said to fear resurgence of german militarism	14742.204
to the editor of the new york times	229.73596
for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity .	965.73645
the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations .	820.51514
recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations .	839.43256
president kennedy was right when he said , `` we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate ' ' .	136.62027
i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and the far east .	602.5601
it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war .	456.30426
the fact is that the italians , french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs .	352.88586
we have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war .	438.90994
we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin .	601.8284
it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us .	1317.4567
but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany .	446.90988
soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation .	1611.3854
in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated .	2140.714
the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism .	3149.7986
berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse .	2235.772
actually , the communists , out of fear of a united and armed germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the u . n . .	185.62077
if the communists are sincere in wanting a united , neutral and disarmed germany , it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age .	588.82526
it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation .	2402.88
france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany .	14991.736
if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria .	776.17017
president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` operation survival ' ' which has many facets .	602.8004
why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states ? ?	658.5342
a united germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world .	1073.2815
to the editor of the new york times	229.73596
in your editorial of sept . 30 `` the smoldering congo ' ' you make the following comment `` far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments .	541.3662
it is up to the assembly to take action against them .	239.32495
they are violating their charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion ' ' .	399.48822
i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations	114.22625
`` article 17 , section 1	2065.8066
the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization .	161.91599
the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly .	329.987
a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years ' ' .	302.67435
the u . s . s . r . and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget .	274.3924
but they refuse , as do the arab states , to support the united nations ' expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel , and the u . n . troops in the congo , which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations , but by a special budget .	254.96376
according to the official interpretation of the charter , a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the `` special ' ' united nations ' budgets , and of course cannot be expelled from the organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ) , due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion .	290.46402
connally amendment ' s repeal held step toward world order	5225.6953
to the editor of the new york times	229.73596
in your sept . 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress you referred to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril ' ' .	409.64728
yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country ' s domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international court of justice .	1124.466
the connally amendment says that the united states , rather than the court , shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party .	137.56317
if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic , the court has no jurisdiction .	265.02368
since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states , it also prevents us from using the court effectively .	351.14035
yet although the kennedy administration , and the eisenhower administration before it , have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been taken .	597.1256
our `` destiny ' ' in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law .	175.51216
to achieve this destiny , acts as well as words are needed -- not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect .	1136.8136
what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment -- an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court , enable us to utilize it , and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order ? ?	522.2572
we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment .	974.92725

many home-bound subway riders utilizing the flushing-main street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their express comes to a stop , leaving them stranded and strained .	1429.0325
to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy-fourth street and change for the ind , this takes a daily toll of time and temper .	882.09186
the transit authority has recently placed in operation `` hold ' ' lights at bmt thirty-ninth and fifty-ninth street stations in brooklyn .	2665.9358
this `` holds ' ' the local until the express passengers change trains .	920.3936
without question , this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the woodside station .	1384.7686

as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day .	252.42787
in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service .	619.5437
it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing .	1131.3647
however , there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators .	753.1865
i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls , special long-distance calls , etc . .	1967.3657
either it is lack of training , lack of proper screening when hiring , lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company , which does have a government-blessed monopoly .	468.69952
i disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled .	2829.854
the funeral for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price , far less than i had expected to pay .	297.8558
but the hospitals and doctors should be .	226.79283
recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children .	2266.0164
hazel park donates its recreation center , five days a week , to the school .	217.77292
there is no charge and no state aid .	228.1936
kiwanis , american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support .	654.32117
there are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school .	441.15802
reading , writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass .	3255.0693
enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon .	4057.0535
southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus ( the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ) .	941.691
the school is located at 9-1/2 mile road , woodward heights .	3682.814
visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do .	824.9431
i was surprised at mayor miriani ' s defeat , but perhaps mayor-elect cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago .	1541.4597
maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare , dpw and sanitation .	510.43454
negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great .	6792.777
he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night .	771.18353
there should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling .	798.99896
our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case .	623.70087
drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out .	793.1861
educate the city employes to give real service to the public .	199.55124
after all , they are paid by the public , they should be examples .	91.67507
at a recent meeting of the women ' s association of the trumbull ave . united presbyterian church , considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible .	480.37323
some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the daily prayer and three minutes a day , as being very helpful .	1087.1677
we feel that the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines .	533.65546
thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence .	2570.732
how old do you have to be to remember when americans , especially children , were encouraged to be polite ? ?	220.62224
why has this form of gentility gone out of american life ? ?	649.0369
how can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults are due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely ? ?	703.8436
writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern ' ' parents they have observed .	347.58966
from necessity , they are also inspired by the `` hard-sell ' ' attitude of the sponsor , so , finally , it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising .	186.9401
i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area .	386.21152
to the editor of the inquirer	228.26944
i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles .	2914.5354
we have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city .	1426.8849
maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost ' ' town .	474.98392
to the editor of the inquirer	228.26944
i worked on the schuylkill expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn ' t be an expressway .	534.1435
without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future .	233.57007
mr . george hough ( oct . 30 ) sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop .	493.9188
the trucks today help pay for this highway .	599.1666
they try to keep within the speed limits .	909.3741
although today ' s trucks are as fast as passenger cars , a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road .	1046.9043
to the editor of the inquirer	228.26944
the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter `` simpleton ' ' instead of `` simplicitude ' ' .	925.56976
such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden .	838.7595
there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates , but not for the dropouts .	511.42465
what we need is more vocational training in high schools , not more dropouts .	586.8388

i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! !	1012.7077
i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is .	2077.984
will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? ?	926.0015
if an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it .	1050.1866
as i see it , if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back , the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary .	556.4127
why do we need bigger and better bombs ? ?	487.85638
i repeat , two wrongs do not make a right .	266.65103

to our everlasting shame , we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki .	697.48004

just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one .	478.86612
the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides .	749.788
intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan , london or pearl harbor .	804.7132
that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war .	894.1859
russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world .	864.29095

while `` better late than never ' ' may have certain merits , the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation .	821.0102
had it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations was living , unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and , in many ways , thankless task .	333.67163
according to one report , however , mr . hammarskjold was considered `` too controversial ' ' a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring .	275.2761
actually , of course , that label `` controversial ' ' applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union .	501.14145
at khrushchev ' s door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated .	650.5015
it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed .	899.3365

just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a first-class example of `` people to people ' ' good will .	2591.695
if only this could be done more often -- with such heartening results -- many of the earth ' s `` big problems ' ' would shrink to the insignificances they really are .	302.4122

to the editor of the inquirer	228.26944
your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable	2370.8044
however , several pertinent considerations deserve recognition .	3419.2012
one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea .	420.95773
we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice .	538.7547
they start on the east side of the schuylkill , have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination .	380.17673
bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings .	2871.5684
each one of these is , by its nature , a focal point or a point of natural congestion .	329.39038
we should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep cars starting and ending on the east side of the river -- on the east side .	446.3442
this can be accomplished by several logical steps ( 1 )	210.47696
widen the east river drive at least one lane .	555.8696
so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems .	1002.1973
paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges .	1328.9962
one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent .	882.1843
this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive .	844.132
to the editor of the inquirer	228.26944
i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square 1 .	1015.189
replace it with the statue of one or another of the world ' s famous dictators .	220.52832
there ' s no sense in being reminded of times that were .	330.4288
washington square seems not part of a free land .	230.2647
it may remind one of russia , china or east berlin	778.6928
but it can ' t remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for .	340.87857
the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals , because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square .	355.01242
the matter may seem a small thing to some people , i know , but it ' s a very good start on the road to totalitarianism the commission has posted signs in washington square saying	306.3545
the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square .	274.3101
does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance ? ?	1712.9901
if birds don ' t belong in a square or park , what does ? ?	159.76001
they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature .	303.42664
the trees are their homes	6431.3516
but the commission does not share such sentiments .	223.71497
the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds .	1358.0391
starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon , from city hall .	1649.9523
if any are left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too .	272.15945
the city government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives .	3865.8186
let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe , lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive .	2680.8367
of course , in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we ' re afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say , `` how come ? ?	612.2224
who wants this deed done ' ' ? ?	31.003426
-- in this small way do the leaders of a city , or of a nation , inure the masses to watching , or even inflicting , torture and death , upon even their fellow men .	463.42526
one means to help the birds occurs to me let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily , discontinue any piece of music but one .	1689.8845
let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began , the hymn `` abide with me ' ' .	397.2443
we will know , and he will know , to whom it is rendered , what the birds would ask	149.75124
to the editor of the inquirer	228.26944
there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too `` soft ' ' .	299.49033
unfortunately , those who would remedy our `` softness ' ' seek to do so with calisthenics .	600.8598
they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy .	228.863
it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft .	1017.3488
ashamed of our wealth and power , afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace , we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies .	2047.0696
when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation , when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no longer be `` soft ' ' .	421.8298
america doesn ' t need to `` push-up ' ' , she needs to stand up ! !	86.845764
the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals , is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit .	852.9159
however , he states unequivocally `` the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor ' ' .	412.0868
i must , in fairness , take issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals .	1467.9949
the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with `` sweetheart contracts ' ' .	423.92688
these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes .	329.67465
a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute .	2227.2878
anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders .	2306.4338
further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrum-griffin act .	663.2863
the nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet .	784.8923
it is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories .	753.64966
they predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting .	269.86694
the biggest nuclear device the united states has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our b-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece .	2136.5117
some time ago , however , mr . khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the soviet union would make them .	267.3991
he seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock .	535.17883
and now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side .	1096.9935
khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ? ?	1307.8999
so be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing .	717.69116
so escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds .	2201.1873
what is needed , philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun ( october 26 ) is a discontinuity .	1521.4989
the escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon .	643.4489
`` only a discontinuity can end it ' ' , professor morrison writes .	418.48883
`` the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy ' ' .	203.61407
morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- europe of course must be written off out of hand .	311.06644
he feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take .	239.53766
his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon , governor rockefeller , past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission , dr . edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war .	1111.0519
these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security .	191.98975
escalation is their first love and their last	547.1514
they will be faithful unto death .	15144.662
capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation ' s security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .	184.1199
if this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation .	577.0829
he has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges .	2333.4443
but if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously .	1135.7694
not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere .	947.8539
khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps .	1597.3108
when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural .	317.3876
thus , when the russians sent up their first sputnik , american chagrin was human enough , and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable .	1730.2418
but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly .	360.209
when east germans fled to the west by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of western publicists .	964.17755
they are less vocal now , when it is the west berliners who are migrating .	731.78705
the flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic .	475.13705
west berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable .	307.85095
nearly 18 per cent of west berlin ' s 2 , 200 , 000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12 . 8 per cent are under fifteen .	377.81705
r . h . s . crossman , m . p . , writing in the manchester guardian , states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1 , 700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1 , 900 a week .	563.66345
the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people .	532.82574
whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead .	931.80664
the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany , but the hard truth , says crossman , is that `` the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german , as distinct from russian , troops was a major communist victory , which dealt west berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow .	946.41046
the gallant half-city is dying on its feet ' ' .	134.2656
another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer ( london ) .	384.6913
mark arnold-foster writes `` people are leaving ( west berlin ) because they think it is dying .	287.3516
they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers ' federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months ' front-line work in factories in west berlin .	924.6258
berlin ' s resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed ' ' .	128.7053
the handwriting is on the wall .	44.274563
the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city .	487.3544
state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort , will not avail .	569.73944
tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful .	203.53409
the materials for compromise are at hand the nation , walter lippmann and other sober commentators ( see alan clark on p . 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .	1606.2034
a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save berlin .	326.4417
or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence , if that is what the west wants .	749.79346
the removal of stalin ' s body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history .	494.9321
it is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead .	403.72726
a british writer , richard haestier , in a book , dead men tell tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry 4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob .	855.7064
and in england , after the restoration , the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn .	1018.85913
the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows .	337.81772
contemplating these posthumous punishments , stalin should not lose all hope .	210.6373
in 1899 , parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster , facing whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands .	1160.9379
nikita khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself .	275.78806
the lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplores waste .	1190.3596
who will take stalin ' s place beside lenin ? ?	344.22165
there is karl marx , of course , buried in london .	174.94333
the macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable .	867.05084
who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin ? ?	831.596
since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people .	167.24791
besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life .	799.02716
suppose he did lie beside lenin , would it be permanent ? ?	795.0681
if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? ?	1566.6274
when a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put .	260.44055
if nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand .	996.69147
the appointment of u thant of burma as the u . n . ' s acting secretary general -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .	271.19537
mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland were early favorites in the running , but france didn ' t like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter .	324.14374
with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr . hammarskjold , u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .	386.3458
what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy .	524.5538
in all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries ' theme , the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .	894.22473
he has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .	523.54
he is a buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung .	729.7162
u thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when mr . hammarskjold ' s term would have come to an end .	143.80136
whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen .	436.91644
mr . khrushchev ' s demand for a troika is dormant , not dead	739.7518
the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents .	688.1174
in a sense , the showdown promised by mr . hammarskjold ' s sudden and tragic death has been avoided	545.3745
no precedents have been set as yet	961.43945
structurally , the u . n . is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it .	504.33673
but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong .	849.96643
no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .	1530.8356
these are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it , as messrs . salsich and engh report on page 372 .	2250.644
even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ?	1193.5767
) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading .	657.83936
friends , a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley , alabama .	2992.9104
`` if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast ' ' , the account reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls .	1011.8003
heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving civil defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute ' s notice ' ' .	853.38293
according to friends , the unit was organized by john snook , a former world war 2 , commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company .	354.02826
the girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck	4792.1997
they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies ' accessories .	2449.2341
this may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy .	1348.5461
the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .	192.89087
the doctrine has never worked	834.1703
the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms	1089.1279
it cannot bring them into actual play .	401.31558
a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined .	437.66458
as the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real .	489.5043
soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .	878.9093
all false gods resemble moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice .	524.78046
but there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands .	675.5597
the annual butchery of 40 , 000 american men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive	1274.2518
a quota of 25 , 000 a year would be more than sufficient .	194.3862
no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace .	1232.815
if the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25 , 000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states .	517.059
but by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily .	375.20984
yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical .	263.3018
here , then , is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning .	295.1851
from next new year ' s day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication .	851.2469
to avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse	5062.542
but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners .	505.5146
then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july 4 , 1963 .	670.90686
the scene , of course , should be nine miles northwest of centralia , illinois , the geographical center of population according to the census .	362.0564
a special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized .	780.985
the band should play the rogues ' march as a processional , switching to `` hail columbia , happy land ' ' ! !	1059.8137
independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it .	435.8396
the highway system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40 , 000 americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do .	376.21313
hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better .	262.273
moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social .	292.42783
it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as it is generally termed , staying put .	744.3666
true , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , `` home-keeping hearts are happiest ' ' , is as disreputable as socinianism .	1533.9331
nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists , which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith .	888.92584
perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia , robert ruark ' s grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is `` all this gallivantin ' ' ' .	441.34906
in any event , the yearly sacrifice of 40 , 000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith .	617.18744
somehow our contemporary moloch must be induced to see reason .	295.5679
since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example .	447.6143
if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25 , 000 per annum , then somebody is going to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson .	564.4147
to hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways	445.31125
so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected .	303.62955
as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race .	906.9771
but the guilt is shared by the united states , britain and france , the other members of the atomic club .	120.28639
until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 , the us and uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down .	685.21075
as it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body	2280.9253
for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies .	1899.2382
the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations .	419.13907
so , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr . khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat .	833.9392
shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions	6178.244
on october 19 , after the soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country , in `` self protection ' ' , might have to resume above-ground tests .	1002.28436
more recently , the chairman of the atomic energy commission , dr . glenn t . seaborg , `` admitted ' ' to a news conference in las vegas , nevada , that the us might fall behind russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain .	607.89276
all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood .	850.28625
but for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science ' s worst-marked channels , full of tricky currents and unknown depths .	842.6143
the scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the most vital points , at least publicly .	242.46527
on the one hand , the public health service declared as recently as october 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern ' ' or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the aj .	765.4879
but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states ' ' .	273.90936
then it added `` it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected ' ' .	217.49771
having hedged its bets in this way , phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all `` at present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected ' ' .	489.04257
then , to conclude on an indeterminate note `` nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world ' ' .	373.4173
dr . linus pauling , a nobel prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not .	452.9906
after declaring , in an article last month in frontier magazine , that the russian testing `` carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world ' ' , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled 200 megatons	491.6869
the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160 , 000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects .	868.6254
long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200 , 000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia .	2730.314
most of these would be in the northern hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating .	228.25652
pauling ' s estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility .	535.2646
the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn .	950.3883
but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem .	1175.3678
its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .	964.54865
an illustration of this attitude is found in john a . mccone ' s letter to dr . thomas lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic .	282.98795
to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout .	2778.9348
a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec ' s division of biology and medicine stated `` the question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered ' ' herein .	577.0469
of course , the aec is in a bind now .	1509.1733
if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests .	826.7956
so the commission ' s announcements of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague .	637.02325
now , of course , that the russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid , when the us was testing in the atmosphere .	280.80487
the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold .	470.85043
after a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof .	1409.9437
yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout , it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count .	948.45654
how much fallout will we get ? ?	51.074615
as of october 25 , the aec had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of tnt )	748.52844
and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported .	366.21588
assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons .	757.95197
some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated .	825.47705
if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far .	1259.0323
to this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in november , 1958 .	1545.1105
one of the inescapable realities of the cold war is that it has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas .	895.6124
the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself .	471.7642
that dilemma is as much with us as ever .	283.0109
the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests .	326.42148
when this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late ' 50 ' s -- the united states appeared to have three choices .	543.43195
it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations .	528.4804
it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination .	458.3417
or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security .	860.5085
this third choice was in fact made .	153.28531
with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken .	590.6475
once again , the united states must choose .	125.13605
and once again , the choices are much the same .	214.48419
only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .	343.2646
the first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the russians .	890.36346
the second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere .	2234.5186
the third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as russian behavior demonstrates , a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable .	1128.1621
we take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us .	310.1536
it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable .	579.63806
its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice	170.78789
one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience .	545.446
that is the contamination we most fear .	1393.6516
leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice .	955.4137
for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now proposing .	950.319
in particular , governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests .	1367.9805
speaking recently in miami , governor rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests ' ' .	267.8529
taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the united states is `` to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right ' ' .	151.15628
what was missing in the governor ' s argument , as in so many similar arguments , was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right .	342.60065
the possibility , as he asserted , that the russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand .	497.83038
besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governor ' s case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary .	530.2018
recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have , to the contrary , assured us that our lead is very great .	654.3236
unless the administration and the defense department have been deceiving us , the facts do not support the assertion that we are `` compelled ' ' to resume atmospheric testing .	445.33652
it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in the future , be necessary and even justifiable .	597.1054
but a resumption does not seem justifiable now .	448.42886
what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations .	1102.9161
we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake .	398.04996
this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism .	1635.9752
too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part .	1047.389
there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does .	388.79077
the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start .	466.27734
when his holiness pope john 23 , first called for an ecumenical council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for christian unity , the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate .	874.24756
with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom .	761.598
but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides .	540.77515
the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church .	532.6436
as it has turned out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses .	261.55002
two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy .	612.06274
first of all , it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity .	592.66583
far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the pontiff believes that a revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light .	469.90527
equally significant , pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity .	922.9052
a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity .	209.49489
secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church .	527.3758
the establishment , by the holy father , of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern .	369.963
the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches assembly in new delhi as `` official ' ' observers reverses the church ' s earlier stand .	781.3909
the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state , cardinal cicognani , for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act .	1703.5624
nor can one forget pope john ' s unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury .	786.5737
augustin cardinal bea , the director of the secretariate for christian unity , has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the church ' s stance toward the protestant and orthodox churches .	599.1141
noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone .	236.08084
for discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts , `` would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of god , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit ' ' .	311.2718
can any christian fail to respond to these words ? ?	145.6893
the administration ' s official budget review , which estimates a 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year , isn ' t making anyone happy .	642.53955
certainly it isn ' t making the president happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year .	619.46387
we sympathize with mr . kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn ' t please us either , although for very different reasons .	205.69
furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring .	1168.4536
in the first place , a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhower ' s estimate of a 1 . 5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing president ' s farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor .	351.7898
the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received .	770.4946
the rest of the deficit is also easily understood .	1250.7538
four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense , an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration , quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere .	819.4442
four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglected by mr . eisenhower .	285.97128
the farm program will cost an additional 1 . 5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the food for peace program and other new measures .	502.56888
anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6 . 9 billion dollar deficit .	849.81726
our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures .	736.13275
and yet mr . kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up ' ' and `` economizing ' ' .	500.93765
we wish the president would remember that `` fiscal responsibility ' ' was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election .	209.71217
the party that won used to say something about a new frontier .	439.21082
introduction of the `` dialogue ' ' principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october .	524.546
two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants , and when the speaker was a catholic , one `` discussant ' ' on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion .	408.9517
sessions devoted to `` ethics and foreign policy trends ' ' , `` moral principle and political judgment ' ' , `` christian ethics in the cold war ' ' and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves .	451.00217
usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker or discussion leader .	726.24524
in the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law , which dr . william v . o ' brien of georgetown university , advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy .	727.6082
that aristotelean-thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants , but in the end the concept came to reassert itself .	583.2081
speakers declared that protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name .	327.00055
a lebanese moslem told about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the `` divine law ' ' , while a c . a . i . p . member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new u . n . nations told of its widespread recognition on the african continent .	186.85179
the impression was unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence .	458.29208
another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself .	117.179016
the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable .	1905.5964
it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other ' s positions and better comprehension of one ' s own .	337.989
but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed , and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues .	2516.6748
one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical ' ' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend berlin , for example	724.4136
the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account	1829.977
it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative .	483.06122
everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question .	376.0569
i was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy .	582.98846
i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts .	475.00113
but i questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian ' s dreamy irredentism .	1163.9404
their answer was it can be done , and we will do it .	51.494324
and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang kai-shek `` in america ' ' , i said , `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland .	492.5359
what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done ' ' ? ?	171.92003
( he always smiles -- at least at visitors , i gather .	471.07278
he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions .	1344.3741
i recalled sympathetically the duke ' s complaint in browning ' s `` my last duchess ' ' .	549.0078
) he smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , `` the president wonders where you are going after you leave taipei ' ' ? ?	282.46326
that , i smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one .	456.28604
i answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly .	1970.5448
chiang spoke again , this time at greater length .	274.88535
`` the president says ' ' , the translator came in , `` that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question .	303.53024
he says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant .	322.1437
so you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions .	359.88367
any information we have here in taiwan is at your disposal ' ' .	275.15796
what are the relevant data ? ?	121.134636
for every person on taiwan , there are sixty in mainland china .	1044.9403
if the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think of liberation , as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia .	1661.2604
less than 60-1 , but at least 6-1 .	1006.02
the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army .	93.271706
the armed forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about 450 , 000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated .	680.8131
it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia , and the army the best trained .	422.23187
even so , it adds up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight ? ?	1338.1958
the miserable people of china , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play , cannot themselves resist overtly .	3868.0054
they think , perforce , of physical survival everything else is secondary .	1265.382
but the army which mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies ? ?	576.48175
the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in china over thousands of years .	498.62814
it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist depersonalization .	1868.8119
every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation .	752.2433
the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? ?	1074.7688
the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed a despot does not economize on his generals .	1261.0463
but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews .	10686.313
their privations are almost beyond endurance .	6238.13
to whom will the generals stay loyal ? ?	6551.235
there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in place of ideological purity out on the farm .	307.79355
it is another question whether `` they ' ' -- or a single general , off in a corner of china , secure for a few ( galvanizing ? ?	279.8817
) days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the party .	2168.3726
but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there .	1584.0713
but there must be a catalytic pressure .	1296.1892
the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .	334.57974
the first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .	1154.8073
the family is largely broken up	2194.4036
and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .	189.69592
for it is the family that , in china , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .	618.2484
now the government must do that	140.94087
but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .	1567.9711
thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .	1328.3677
tibet has historically served china as a buffer state .	482.50845
a friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile .	2438.527
china never tried to integrate tibet by extirpating the people ' s religion and institutions .	1123.9508
red china is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed .	223.87674
tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult .	235.28561
tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleeding france .	5409.1133
these continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension .	455.62137
the imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from the outside , might cause it to snap .	374.55453
the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men .	797.3426
they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control .	724.45605
first and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime .	747.7422
on these they feel they can rely .	177.22162
secondly , they depend on america ' s `` moral cooperation ' ' when the crucial moment arrives .	231.76689
they hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly .	2126.8684
i remarked jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day .	586.44324
he affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point .	500.71866
but he -- and all of china -- wears the scars of american indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are .	782.5293
we have been grand to formosa itself -- lots of aid , and , most of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands .	324.39917
but our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive .	159.88354
a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr . kennedy ' s views on the world struggle .	116.35387
the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike .	282.90295
there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation .	794.82245
the moment of truth is the moment of crisis .	189.0976
during the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures .	625.52094
the crisis burns these suddenly away .	999.6959
there the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look .	292.6912
new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones .	14826.138
a truth-revealing crisis erupted in katanga for a couple of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies .	749.42346
before memory , too , clouds over , let us make a note or two of what could be seen .	436.63132
the measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels .	271.65677
one knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine .	704.4799
but i am here concerned more with policy than with men .	479.3637
public men come and go but great issues of policy remain .	735.6689
now , everyone knows -- or knew in the week of december 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy .	622.27527
the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved .	591.54156
of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations .	167.76183
but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the u . s . was in reality the principal .	243.49611
the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies , to the entire western community .	446.36914
by our policy the west was -- is -- split .	609.08905
but the key revelation is not new .	132.81795
the controlling pattern was first displayed in the hungary-suez crisis of november 1956 .	1101.2455
it reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality in cuba last spring ( with which the dominican events of last month should be paired )	990.4992
at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles	572.97656
in relation to laos , algeria , south africa	979.61
right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana .	3363.0596
this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows under prevailing policy , the u . s . can take the initiative against the right , but cannot take the initiative against the left .	145.84535
it makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue .	391.88922
the u . s . cannot take the initiative against the left .	113.583275
there is even some question whether the u . s . can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left .	225.77942
we can attack tshombe , but not gigenza .	825.86566
no matter that gizenga is moscow ' s man in the congo .	77.393936
no matter that it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men .	1283.834
no matter that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western interests in africa .	1085.6804
( even granted that the congo should be unified , you don ' t protect western security by first removing the pro-western weight from the power equilibrium .	436.6236
we can force britain and france out of the suez , but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest .	440.3499
we can mass our fleet against the trujillos , but not against the castros .	647.5985
we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall -- much less , give the simple order to push the wall down .	887.77026
we officially receive the anti-french , moscow-allied algerian fln , but we denounce the pro-europe , anti-communist oas as criminal .	10825.858
in the very week of our war against katanga , we make a $133 million grant to kwame nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship .	1114.7756
as our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-western katangans , we stand supinely bleating while nehru ' s troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato ally , portugal .	4282.2227
what explains this uni-directional paralysis ? ?	281.85687
it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy .	295.0673
the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration , but only made more consistent and more active .	326.60114
most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa , katanga and ghana , as to the suez-hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of asia , africa and latin america .	580.9167
from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted ' ' ( `` neutralist ' ' , `` contested ' ' ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- nehru , tito , nkrumah , sukarno , betancourt , etc . .	461.80438
our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes .	1115.1313
if we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible .	523.40576
and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left .	188.47215
to write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it .	277.29886
nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else ' s book .	217.89111
to get started , he does not scan the world about him	218.1604
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists .	2672.9521
so far this season , broadway ' s premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original american stage plays .	908.8612
of straight dramas , there are all the way home , which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel , a death in the family	459.75684
the wall , awkwardly based on the john hersey novel	3924.9817
advise and consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller	13769.095
face of a hero ( closed ) , based on a pierre boulle novel .	548.4002
the only original works attempting to reach any stature tennessee williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , period of adjustment , and arthur laurents ' clever but empty invitation to a march .	1503.8912
clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- a taste of honey , by britain ' s young ( 19 when she wrote it ) shelagh delaney	1812.6763
becket , by france ' s jean anouilh	1116.9364
the hostage ( closed ) , by ireland ' s brendan behan .	1334.1055
among the musicals , camelot came from t . h . white ' s the once and future king , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do re mi .	1104.1816
wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce .	2839.3708
the only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- send me no flowers ( closed ) , under the yum-yum tree , critic ' s choice .	1175.7087
in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival , broadway is not even adapting books , but reconverting old movies ( hail the conquering hero and lili ) .	3354.4653
originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad .	972.3046
some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably life with father and diary of anne frank .	1229.2156
and particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from die fledermaus and the merry widow to oklahoma ! and my fair lady .	2107.7434
as critic walter kerr points out `` adaptations , so long as they are good , still qualify as creative ' ' .	288.58206
and other defenders invariably argue that , after all , shakespeare and moliere were adapters too .	706.3387
the difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world	474.53094
most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own stage technique .	425.03668
the most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers cannot afford to take chances .	977.7881
but that explanation is only partly true .	666.7147
off-broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original .	1796.434
laudably enough , it is offering classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one u . s . original was on the boards , robert d . hock ' s stunning civil war work , borak .	372.78842
the real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of u . s . playwrights .	160.6028
he `` come with me to the casbah ' ' .	134.00354
she `` by subway or cab ' ' ? ?	76.12154
that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan , as more and more new yorkers were discovering 29th street and eighth avenue , where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like arabian nights , grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american inpost of belly dancing .	2248.0774
their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis .	2326.4639
the belly boites , with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek and turkish families .	2802.586
customers often bring their children	1698.305
between performances , enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces .	513.9946
except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption .	11723.542
small , shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time , using guitars , violins , and more alien instruments with names that would open sesame the oud , grandfather of the lute	4249.9517
the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass	4639.6455
the girls sit quietly with the musicians , wearing prim dresses or plain , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem .	976.42065
if a dancer is good , she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny -- the continuum of mankind .	1999.2297
but a great many of what variety calls the `` cooch terpers ' ' are considerably less cosmic than that .	913.09265
each dancer follows the ancient oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room .	1892.6531
this is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) .	3525.5723
the new york dancers are highly eclectic , varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls .	2786.983
the belly dance leaves more to the imagination .	94.47939
when a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers ' costumes .	2668.3447
with tips , the girls average between $150 and $200 a week , depending on basic salary .	883.53827
although they are forbidden to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks , and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy .	755.3074
all over the country , belly clubs have never been bigger , especially in detroit , boston and chicago , and even in small towns	480.68762
one of the best dancers , a turkish girl named semra , works at a roadhouse outside bristol , conn . .	2615.3284
the girls are kept booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded murat somay , a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central abdomen .	3142.8643
he can offer nine turkish girls , plans to import at least 15 more .	1268.1171
but a great many of the dancers are more or less native .	302.57767
sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conducted by lebanese and syrians in the u . s . , where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs .	951.0293
as the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins , the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly .	1811.4131
jemela ( surname gerby ) , 23 , seems hong kong oriental but has a spanish father and an indian mother , was born in america and educated at holy cross academy and textile high school , says she learned belly dancing at family picnics .	1028.6581
serene ( mrs . wilson ) , 23 , was born in budapest and raised in manhattan .	702.5165
daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance , she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the new york casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body .	965.55
many belly dancers are married , but serene is one of the few who will admit it .	249.97546
marlene ( surname adamo ) , 25 , a brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from arabic friends in paris , now lives on manhattan ' s west side , is about the best belly dancer working the casbah , loves it so much that she dances on her day off .	941.7282
she has the small , highly developed body of a prime athlete , and holds in contempt the `` girls who just move sex ' ' .	665.9995
leila ( malia phillips ) , 25 , is a greenwich village painter of persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles .	1576.0487
a graduate of hollywood high school , she likes to imagine herself , as she takes the floor , `` a village girl coming in to a festival ' ' .	195.6715
gloria ( surname ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who was born in italy and once did `` chorus work ' ' in toronto , has been around longer than most of the others , wistfully remembers the old days when `` we used to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all .	544.7284
but the ships are very slow now , and we don ' t get so many sailors any more ' ' .	118.141205
the uptown crowd has moved in , and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar ? ?	4359.138
of the handful of painters that austria has produced in the 20th century , only one , oskar kokoschka , is widely known in the u . s . .	448.57324
this state of unawareness may not last much longer .	1198.1333
for ten years a small group of european and u . s . critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten austrian expressionist egon schiele , who died 42 years ago at the age of 28 .	806.8668
the critics ' campaign finally inspired the first major u . s . exhibit of schiele ' s works .	203.3108
the show has been to boston and manhattan , will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis .	700.9826
last week it opened at the j . b . speed museum in louisville , at the very moment that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau gallery in los angeles .	483.20795
schiele ' s paintings are anything but pleasant .	809.00775
his people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened .	3682.2593
his colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom .	2090.989
but he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination .	531.70465
the son of a railway stationmaster , schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town of tulln , 14 miles northwest of vienna .	3759.812
he was an emotional , lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork .	1671.1383
when he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna .	435.62582
even there he did not last for long .	1297.5948
cried one professor after a few months of student schiele ' s tantrums and rebellion `` the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ' ' ! !	674.78094
for a while his work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of gustav klimt , then the dean of austrian art .	1730.0753
gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter .	891.65594
his pictures were roundly denounced as `` the most disgusting things one has ever seen in vienna ' ' .	507.02625
he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle .	1007.5342
for years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in vienna ' s gutters .	6900.425
drafted into the austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a vienna billet , went on painting .	2078.7888
it was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show .	421.47958
the unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too much even for morbid-minded vienna .	569.7913
he was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust .	503.40378
the children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness , and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic .	2722.9368
the subject he liked most was the female body , which he painted in every state -- naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sitting primly in a chair , lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace .	986.1898
the most surprising thing about the twenty-second congress of the soviet communist party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the twentieth congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous `` secret ' ' report on stalin .	292.02594
the publication last july of the party ' s draft program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism ' ' -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i . e . , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group ' ' ) in all theoretical party journals .	299.24152
these never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of marx and lenin `` full communism ' ' was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a communist society had now , under khrushchev , become an `` immediate and tangible reality ' ' .	338.76767
it seems that khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to marxist doctrine with his draft program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) .	920.0997
he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` all people ' s state ' ' , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization ' ' of the whole hierarchy of soviets , starting with the supreme soviet itself .	308.475
their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy ' ' and would enable `` the people ' ' to take a more direct and active part in running the country .	316.68585
also , elections would be more democratic	151.48756
there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from .	831.5663
no doubt , there was still a lot in the draft program -- and in khrushchev ' s speech -- which left many points obscure .	429.52286
was it the party ' s intention , for example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes , i . e . , state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively `` urbanized ' ' ) ? ?	359.38345
as we know , the soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot	1467.0956
and it is still very far from certain how valid the party ' s claim is that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes ' ' the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm .	599.6865
if one follows the reports of the congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter .	252.43666
the draft program was interesting in other respects , too .	252.24533
it contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays	1513.0463
they still benefit far less than the `` other ' ' 50 per cent of the nation from that `` welfare state ' ' which the soviet union so greatly prides itself on being .	214.26627
over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly	19550.17
and , though he repeated , over and over again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the `` ordinary ' ' people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how `` communism ' ' is really going to work in practice , especially in respect of food .	326.41772
would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry ? ?	314.33212
this was something on which k . himself seemed to have some doubts	1211.8832
for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears ' ' of those responsible for agricultural production .	385.25635
and , as we know , the virgin lands are not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped .	531.55536
one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev ' s agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group ' ' -- molotov , malenkov , kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old marshal voroshilov .	561.2622
molotov , in particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services , to increase rents and fares	863.5647
in fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the khrushchev `` welfare state ' ' .	174.42656
the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story what , in the secret councils of the kremlin , molotov had really proposed , we just don ' t know , and he has had no chance to reply .	297.25903
but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party ' ' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism ' ' and , last but not least , on foreign policy .	608.7963
the whole problem of `` peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition ' ' with the capitalist world is in the very center of this congress .	300.1232
`` molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence , reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war .	405.63553
his views , in fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look upon it merely as a variant of the `` cold war ' ' or of an `` armed peace ' ' .	312.98187
one cannot help wondering whether molotov and the rest of the `` anti-party group ' ' are not being used as china ' s whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers .	504.55707
for something , clearly , has gone very , very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese relations , which were never easy , and have now deteriorated .	686.7291
the effect of chou en-lai ' s clash with khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on molotov & co . , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the soviet people , from the `` epoch-making ' ' twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese conflict .	606.2794
not only , as we know , did chou en-lai publicly treat khrushchev ' s attack on albania as `` something that we cannot consider as a serious marxist-leninist approach ' ' to the problem ( i . e . , as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic ' ' ) , but the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and so on .	578.44916
it is extremely doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends .	902.57135
the big question is whether , in the name of a restored chinese-soviet solidarity , the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians to present their humble apologies to khrushchev -- or get rid of enver hoxa .	1097.2556
these seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident ' ' can now be closed .	254.7805
but albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between china and russia .	348.36493
khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence ' ' and would like , above all , the berlin and german problems to be settled peacefully	852.4195
he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the russo-american `` honeymoon ' ' of 1959 .	229.88051
but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from china , but perhaps also from that `` china lobby ' ' which , i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago , exists on the quiet inside the party .	410.90033
to these people , solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russia ' s future policy .	266.76117
and the chinese , as the albanian incident shows , have strong suspicions that khrushchev is anxious to secure a `` shameful ' ' peace with the west .	600.4952
the fact that china ( which is obsessed by formosa -- to khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by north korea and north vietnam is highly indicative .	648.8596
and one cannot but wonder whether marshal malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the west , wasn ' t trying to keep the chinese quiet .	1312.9387
and this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb .	1253.7083
was not this dropped primarily in order to `` appease ' ' the chinese -- especially after `` khrushchev ' s `` humiliating ' ' surrender to the west in canceling the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31 ? ?	548.6134
what does it all add up to ? ?	158.09848
indications are that khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of berlin ) the maintenance of the status quo in the world .	240.35287
the chinese , north vietnamese and north koreans , on the other hand , feel that , militarily , russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation ' ' they would like to embark on before long with china attacking formosa and the north koreans and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries .	940.6718
perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the `` anti-party group ' ' nearly liquidated him .	391.9479
he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition	570.3785
but if he is up against china ' s crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life .	301.4617
he may support china ( but he won ' t )	185.14996
he may break with china ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuading china to be patient .	667.6036
the next days may show where things stand .	1492.1124
on a misty sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-communists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here .	1457.3795
eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare .	1996.8658
to the average american , this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie .	2241.35
but to the minutemen , this is a serious business .	119.83155
they feel that the united states is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy .	681.62317
they feel that world war 3 , has already begun , and they are setting themselves up as a `` last line of defense ' ' against the communist advance .	4442.9785
their national leader , robert bolivar depugh of norborne , mo . , says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the red onslaught .	3381.5261
in their maneuvers last month , they wore world war 2 , camouflage garb and helmets , and carried unloaded m-1 rifles .	2719.0496
the maneuvers were held `` in secret ' ' after a regional seminar for the minutemen , held in nearby shiloh , ill . , had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs , who had arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville , ill . , and seized four operative weapons , including a browning machine gun , two browning automatic rifles and an m-4 rifle .	1730.8484
undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli ' s home at 6 30 a . m . the next day , put on their uniforms , and headed for a farm several miles away .	299.37524
a 60 mm . mortar and a 57 mm . recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along .	2640.314
the mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated .	3985.9924
after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war 2 , army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully .	1766.9417
here the two leaders , depugh and lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces .	916.9404
the minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment .	377.73062
they were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge .	6793.7227
they practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades	11804.071
and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment .	5333.537
eleven dummy rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting .	2316.9497
mrs . depugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband ' s organization , participated in all the exercises .	192.9238
there were no `` casualties ' ' , but the `` guerrillas ' ' admitted to being `` a little tired ' ' when the leaders called a halt at 9 a . m . to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane .	197.20044
i would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by russell kirk ( dec . 16 ) .	1275.7091
it has to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure .	686.30884
next september , after receiving a degree from yale ' s master of arts in teaching program , i will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers .	716.61053
the amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers .	441.76196
teaching is at present a sellers ' market	2867.5386
as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers .	318.26447
but this is not the real problem	442.62372
the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality .	266.77695
hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary .	311.63965
i am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country , the profession is grossly overpaid .	447.7364
it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases	804.8521
there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance .	1096.2698
the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them .	1067.5908
the only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure .	443.8625
here , as in all sectors of the economy , quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses .	308.94208
on the eve of the `` great debate ' ' on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the atlantic community , we should face the alternatives on this proposition .	624.8127
what we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate .	528.3239
without this power we lay open any american industry which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others .	701.69794
it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs .	526.9801
i disagree with mr . burnham ' s position on the common market ( nov . 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join .	155.25645
for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of this kind is difficult to understand .	278.98016
the pressure for our entry to the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare ' ' , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background .	629.00037
the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal , as well as economic , self-rule .	333.84256
in entering this union we will be surrendering most , if not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the atlantic institute ( recently set up ) or the o . e . c . d . , i . m . f . and others .	208.9722
to think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking .	2329.9521
if it is not enough that all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join this market , i refer you to an article in the new york times ' magazine section ( nov . 12 , 1961 ) , by mr . eric johnston , entitled `` we must join the common market ' ' .	568.29376
he says `` it has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs ' ' .	2417.2268
referring to britain , he says , `` we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy , placing this authority in continental hands ' ' .	458.24185
since the goal of our international planners is a world government , this atlantic community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once american economic autonomy is absorbed , a larger grouping is a question of time .	532.9688
frankly , it is being very cleverly done for , in a sense , they have us over a barrel .	461.46362
listen to what mr . johnston has to say `` consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict .	1052.2133
we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need .	1472.7268
we would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment ' ' .	388.3322
but the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community or `` economic empire ' ' , but merely what libertarians like henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry .	970.8161
create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we ' ll compete with anyone , europe and asia combined .	471.63736
in short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won ' t have to worry about european competition or communism either .	934.2745
if we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it	175.90402
not acquiesce to an international planning board .	646.044
if we go into this common market , we might just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees , connally amendments or , for that matter , conservatism in general .	1009.5593
we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the atlantic common market which jnr will be continuing in our pages .	528.3829
the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning , november 27 , anticipating by two days the announcement of the u . s . treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed .	539.4174
in 1954 i was drafted and after serving two years honorably on active duty i was not required to participate in any further army reserve activities .	1456.7445
now , more than five years later , i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier .	590.781
but , in spite of this , i , at present a man 31 years of age and a college professor , have been recalled `` by direction of the president ' ' to report on november 25th to fort devens , massachusetts , for another twelve months of active duty as an sp 4 ( the equivalent of a pfc ) .	486.10455
today , seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee , i am assistant professor of philosophy and science at st . michael ' s college .	301.79105
for , after leaving the army in 1956 , i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college and then at the university of toronto .	301.345
this time , added to that which i had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 , makes a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education .	503.32147
the possibility of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys .	372.97705
with this no loyal citizen can quarrel .	852.23175
however , it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably , equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes ' ' .	1392.8306
in my own case , i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking .	663.991
taken back into the army now as an sp 4 , i am leaving 110 college students whose teacher i am .	1134.6484
( a wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes .	368.27194
) at this late date , it is impossible for st . michael ' s college to find a suitable replacement for me .	183.48666
even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- i cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone mad .	841.77625
mercenary term of honor ? ?	19.118235
in news broadcasts i consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army referred to as mercenaries .	1523.8005
if the hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for england in the 1770 ' s were mercenaries , what shall we call the un troops sent to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the united nations ? ?	421.86884
if the un troops are not mercenaries then the hessians were not mercenaries either .	1196.9353
and if the foreigners fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette and von steuben were mercenaries too , as were also the members of the lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 , and of chennault ' s flying tigers in the early days of world war 2 .	608.82275
it doesn ' t take a gore vidal to tell you what ' s wrong with cherokee textile ' s slogan ( pitney-bowes objects ' ' , july 1 ) .	929.5699
it ' s an eighteenth-century negative , man ! !	929.68207
suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment by moving the term `` republic ' ' to lower case , substituting the modern phrase , `` move ahead ' ' for the stodgy `` keep ' ' , and by using the postmaster ' s name on every envelope ( in caps , of course , with the `` in spite ' ' as faded as possible ) , the slogan cannot fail .	322.79813
in the issue of march 5 , 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said	656.346
`` on trial in jakarta for having flown for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents , u . s . pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters , he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of indonesia .	1167.6644
facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty , he said ' i have participated in the war against communism in korea and at dienbienphu , and i have helped in the evacuation of north vietnamese to the free world .	487.31882
i have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by communist domination .	322.3284
at least in indonesia , khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with communism ' ' ! !	185.45331
since then nothing has happened to save the life of pope .	321.88882
i found recently a very small article in the new york times	392.14926
indonesia court upholds pope ' s death sentence .	177.16866
-- indonesia military supreme court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence pope , an american pilot .	1411.4001
pope was convicted last year of having aided north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions .	4156.366
he has been in prison since may , 1958 , when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas .	780.2513
he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency ' ' .	164.0334
as we see , pope may appeal to president sukarno , khrushchev ' s friend , for clemency .	422.40283
this possibility is anything but reassuring .	1497.8851
the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban freedom fighters .	689.3207
but who will act now and immediately to save the life of alan pope ? ?	434.42395
are tractors available for him ? ?	107.019066
does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-communist american pilot ? ?	552.86194
a few days before i saw your mention of what texas liberals were doing to promote `` louis capet ' ' ( the week ' ' , june 3 ) , another analogy had occurred to me .	325.59973
`` with no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he was the government ' ' .	153.33034
`` a ' dust-settling ' period of decadence and decline ' ' .	242.64235
`` he opened his mouth , said little , and thought not at all ' ' .	111.65546
`` not completely virtuous , but completely incompetent ' ' .	334.75162
and marie antoinette -- jacqueline bouvier .	7244.7056
`` the beautiful and light-hearted ' ' .	419.79193
french revolution -- conservative revolution ? ?	115.99307
truly , that liberals should choose louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic , considering the louis 14 , character of their grand monarque , fdr not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies .	1393.3832
in defeating `` louis capet ' ' , john tower ' s victory in texas signals , once again , the end of the divine right of liberalism .	241.12427
it seems to me that n . c . , in his editorial `` confrontation ' ' ( sr , mar . 25 ) , has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer ? ?	475.90005
this affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress .	526.97034
i know of no other solution than the one n . c . proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place .	349.51715
never have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically .	1136.6093
thank you for the illustrated editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	428.12933
it is both great writing and profound religion .	577.0428
n . c . has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece .	641.0382
i feel that n . c . hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` confrontation ' ' .	99.01073
personally , it meant a great deal	459.92303
my only hope is that it will be shared by many , many others .	135.881
`` confrontation ' ' should fortify us all , whether in southeast asia or the u . s . .	224.07089
congratulations to n . c . for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the peace corps .	335.07132
i concur that it is necessary for americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands .	277.40704
it would be heartbreaking to see idealism , and hence effective leadership , thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into .	787.3118
the editorial `` confrontation ' ' was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in america .	235.52875
i personally gained strength from it .	95.703094
thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world .	503.93024
n . c . ' s editorial `` confrontation ' ' is a stunning piece of writing .	211.11684
i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone entering the peace corps to read it .	784.3984
the important people to humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros but the schweitzers and the dooleys , and the others like them whose names we will never know .	971.7503
editor ' s note reprints of `` confrontation ' ' will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the peace corps .	147.63441
a peace corps official described the editorial as `` precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers ' ' .	272.26614
f . l . lucas ' s article in sr ' s april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new english bible .	378.58948
i certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers , rather than the comment by cleveland amory in his first of the month column .	398.53693
it is blind , fundamentalist dogmatism to say , `` messing around with the king james version seems to us a perilous sport at best ' ' .	980.1497
lester markel is on the right track in his article `` interpretation of interpretation ' ' ( sr , mar . 11 ) .	282.6806
the current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact , fancy , and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago .	1684.5651
we don ' t need this type of protection any more .	518.0553
the public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media .	2033.2439
besides , there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about .	9289.531
the accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities .	2750.2405
first , it does not communicate .	114.64833
a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for instance , is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute .	288.2957
second , it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous .	554.2615
the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation .	2526.9246
yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns .	928.5904
despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating .	745.61163
the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions .	374.18018
it seems to me the time has come for the american press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends .	606.14185
the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors .	396.55975
i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president kennedy ' s activities , so far as southern california is concerned .	511.18497
you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions .	510.77637
to begin with , the all-powerful los angeles times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences .	883.95123
i am sure that they did when eisenhower was president .	433.62112
next , because of the time differential , the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day .	225.37166
up until now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 p . m . or sometimes 7 or 10 30 p . m . .	375.07697
even then , a few of the `` less interesting ' ' questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator .	591.39154
however , last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into their programs .	1386.2781
this is no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary .	1010.2109
the radio stations did run `` transcripts ' ' ( i thought ) during the evening hours .	200.10579
however , by comparing the tv snatches , two different radio station re-runs , and the censored los angeles times version , i found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( abc removed the one regarding laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president ' s answer .	913.6471
i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the `` abuse ' ' he is being subjected to .	186.01747
we out here don ' t see enough of the conference to know he is being abused .	92.86763
i don ' t know if this is the situation in other parts of the country	138.6388
it also happened with the inauguration , which was not re-run at all during the evening hours , and i wrote to the tv editor of the times .	310.85083
he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations ' not doing this -- but nothing happened .	357.09885
can you bring the networks ' attention to this ? ?	248.84991
i was interested in james webb young ' s madison avenue column in which he raised the question `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	599.97943
( sr , feb . 11 ) .	31.2444
in my estimation , we definitely do	10718.853
and the sad part of it is that we had one , which was rounding into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die .	356.561
during the war , we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black and white and the various shades of grey in between .	581.27576
we had a couple of schools in this country , the principal one being on the marshall field estate out in lloyd ' s neck .	465.3218
there were also a couple in canada , and several in england .	206.39041
the english schools preceded ours , and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching .	239.2792
four of us here in the united states attended , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in england , canada , and the united states .	159.09628
we set up the lloyd ' s neck school , worked out its curriculum , and taught there .	454.081
toward the end of the war , we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it .	229.13927
when the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust .	349.28888
we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so .	1076.3715
alas , no such thing happened .	754.405
there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare .	1010.97034
a study at the pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there .	877.0275
and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way .	320.12042
congratulations on the article `` do we need a college of propaganda ' ' ? ?	89.20935
this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years , and i certainly hope it sparks some action .	460.94748
let the media clean house , too	238.29895
many of us in public relations were flattered that richard l . tobin chose to devote his editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger of the public relations society of america and the american public relations association .	833.0816
i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published .	451.65616
whether in his forthcoming book c . p . snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important .	922.88983
one should be able to get hold of the book at once .	93.87383
but the attack was made from an advance copy .	854.03467
if this practice should take root and spread , the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality .	881.8689
editor ' s note sir robert watson-watt wrote , on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961	1763.9767
`` i have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled , ' science and government .	328.71335
until the work actually appears i am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail .	661.44403
but i have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin lectures at harvard , from which the book was derived , and i can with confidence challenge the gist of c . p . snow ' s incautious tale ' ' .	610.9235
watson-watt ' s remarks in sr did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures .	582.71136
representatives of harvard university press , which is publishing the book this month of april , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book ' s publication date .	711.7163
the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt .	4173.2466
sir robert watson-watt ' s `` rebuttal ' ' of sir charles snow ' s godkin lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself from sir charles ' supposed falsehoods while stating those `` falsehoods ' ' in an unclear incoherent argument .	1482.9149
the article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning .	423.1354
it calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike ' ' a `` perverted conclusion .	2798.1245
it submits an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing another aspect of the man , but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles ' account .	973.96075
we are left to choose between the two lindemanns .	2020.3783
the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party .	351.70508
but we are to believe that lindemann actively supported radar outside the tizard committee , and dissembling , discounted it inside ? ?	7568.3994
if so , i would lean to sir charles ' conception of the man .	817.21454
i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time .	366.2844
to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it .	2542.2507
it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the violin .	1414.1049
certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless recitals , and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the chicago symphony orchestra , playing the brahms concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed .	1417.21
there was about that song something incandescent , for this brahms was milstein at white heat .	1917.7053
not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent .	292.10773
those would be reserved for the orchestra ' s great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .	501.42947
this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood .	1174.3545
but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .	2011.5615
that is , when mr . milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , mr . hendl could go along .	1625.0376
but mr . hendl does not go straight to any point .	137.06725
he flounders and lets music sprawl .	4344.82
there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion .	1603.5448
so we had some dazzling and memorable milstein , but not great brahms .	1585.9515
the concert opened with another big romantic score , schumann ' s overture to `` manfred ' ' , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic point to keep it afloat .	1228.4801
hindemith ' s joust with weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands transluscent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit .	3971.6946
it got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style .	1142.536
the bayreuth festival opens july 23 with a new production of `` tannhaeuser ' ' staged by wieland wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch .	1289.3776
sawalisch also conducts `` the flying dutch ' ' , opening july 24 .	227.88489
`` parsifal ' ' follows july 25 , with hans knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` die meistersinger ' ' , to be presented aug . 8 and 12 .	535.3684
the `` ring ' ' cycles are july 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and aug . 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 .	169.45331
no casts are listed , but lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano , grace bumbry , will sing venus in `` tannhaeuser ' ' .	1594.5323
remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago missed seeing the bolshoi ballet ? ?	7072.058
remember how by lack of two big theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet ? ?	683.7844
well , now we have two big theaters .	598.42053
but barring a miracle , and don ' t hold your breath for it , chicago will not see the leningrad-kirov ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world .	269.24316
before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did .	1921.0459
the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in mccormick place , which sol hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he doesn ' t weep at the capacity , either .	348.94064
allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates as dec . 4 thru 10 .	668.7981
later the hurok office made it dec . 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory .	875.97003
but if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict .	134.60835
allied arts had booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec . 8 and 9 .	3024.1555
allied arts then notified us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking , fly here to open nov . 28 , and close dec . 2 .	409.65158
shorter booking , but still a booking .	708.31616
a couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake ' ' .	704.9265
so i started making some calls of my own .	337.73203
the kirov ballet is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium , los angeles , nov . 21 thru dec . 4 .	425.9509
not a chance of opening here nov . 28 -- barring that miracle .	3175.296
then why not the juicy booking hurok had held for us ? ?	1612.2777
well , dietrich won ' t budge from mccormick place .	1777.1635
then how about the civic opera house ? ?	630.6916
well , allied arts has booked lena horne there for a week starting dec . 4 .	1728.4376
queried about the impasse , allied arts said `` better cancel the kirov for the time being .	671.6126
it ' s all up in the air again ' ' .	68.20849
so the kirov will fly back to russia , minus a chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country .	856.0231
will somebody please reopen the auditorium ? ?	144.26984
paintings and drawings by marie moore of st . thomas , virgin islands , are shown thru nov . 5 at the meadows gallery , 3211 ellis av . , week days , 3 p . m . to 8 p . m . , sundays 3 p . m . to 6 p . m . , closed mondays .	351.18958
an exhibition of evelyn cibula ' s paintings will open with a reception nov . 5 at the evanston community center , 828 davis st . .	667.90704
abstractions and semi-abstractions by everett mcnear are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame until nov . 5 .	2511.225
in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the dallas civic opera will use san francisco ' s new leni bauer-ecsy production of `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' this season , returning the favor next season when san francisco uses the dallas `` don giovanni ' ' , designed by franco zeffirelli .	1172.9044
h e . bates has scribbled a farce called `` hark , hark , the lark ' ' ! !	1094.3326
it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season .	267.4524
if there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find .	360.07367
perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics .	791.8184
anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions .	2681.8108
another is a wily countryman called larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , i believe , in earlier volumes of mr . bates ' comedie humaine .	1860.4514
well , jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities .	3677.2268
they want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers .	1738.5593
they are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at .	656.9986
and of course larkin has just the thing they want .	185.04997
the name of it is gore court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress t . s . eliot .	638.51764
that ' s not precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it , though .	1983.8816
he conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air .	1921.0991
he suggests that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor .	3222.4097
the stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform .	1441.4929
the vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch .	2113.7854
larkin has an answer to all that .	109.77376
the spaciousness of the tudor cooking areas , for example , will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .	1136.6937
also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented .	2605.9023
it ' s a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse .	2776.1323
he doesn ' t really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from american gold on the london exchange ) he makes them pay .	701.67017
for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot .	16524.443
he has a glorious wife and many children .	225.06944
when he needs money to buy something like , say , the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch , he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies .	738.06866
one of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with gore court .	1758.5824
he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands .	178.47621
and the jerebohms are more than willing to buy it .	400.73636
they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox ' s life on earth .	366.3291
if , in larkin ' s eyes , they are nothing but piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living .	397.6798
mr . bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc .	6379.465
oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war .	201.51942
first the larkins are ahead , then the jerebohms .	659.00195
after larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers .	1525.768
one of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from kipling ' s tales of india , does not approve of the way larkin gets his birds .	834.34576
he doesn ' t think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting .	1216.026
but the brigadier dines on the birds with relish .	434.09488
it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from miguel de cervantes ' `` don quixote ' ' is the brilliant russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street playhouses .	895.425
more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , sancho panza , in seventeenth-century spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character .	5055.175
nikolai cherkasov , the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander nevsky and ivan the terrible , performs the lanky don quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man .	1769.6179
his addle-brained knight-errant , self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues .	1977.5961
cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .	179.08267
he treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .	1652.9999
directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .	1569.4686
the complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the russian dialogue .	1102.2852
the voices of all the characters , including that of cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities .	764.66785
and the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed .	1561.2446
since russian was being spoken instead of spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here .	875.0137
splendid , too , is the performance of yuri tolubeyev , one of russia ' s leading comedians , as sancho panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire ' ' .	936.7847
though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too .	968.40594
it is really as though the russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons .	1625.0934
the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island ' ' is one of the best in the film .	488.92273
true , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before don quixote goes to the duke ' s court .	424.4216
but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy .	3495.9114
there are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange .	937.87524
also on the bill at the fifty-fifth street is a nice ten-minute color film called `` sunday in greenwich village ' ' , a tour of the haunts and joints .	1113.8442
television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family .	428.65533
there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary .	797.78754
at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` chicago and all that jazz ' ' , presented on nbc-tv nov . 26 .	268.33264
the program came out of the nbc special projects department , and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series .	366.3371
perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .	3146.487
if so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents .	454.61136
as a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results .	341.40707
a few years ago a `` timex all-star jazz show ' ' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from lionel hampton ' s big band to the free-wheeling dukes of dixieland .	2445.881
an enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live ' ' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .	412.4859
about that same time john crosby ' s tv series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .	872.8771
in an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .	1739.1141
the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .	339.2188
cameras stared at soloists ' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work .	2538.17
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' could not be faulted on the choice of artists .	322.15997
some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden , gene krupa , bud freeman , pee wee russell , johnny st . cyr , joe sullivan , red allen , lil armstrong , blossom seeley .	3745.6362
the jazz buff could hardly ask for more .	419.65924
furthermore , garry moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies .	8037.028
( he played host at the timex show already mentioned .	2104.1406
one of the script ' s big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today .	396.72678
nbc had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share .	249.49211
for example , there was sheet music with the word `` jazz ' ' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold .	256.73605
samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920 ' s .	738.3013
however well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening ' s main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the chicago style .	714.1146
another source of nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse .	2268.403
similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal .	896.02295
`` chicago and all that jazz ' ' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .	1786.162
by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today ' s artists , the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either .	615.6223
still , the network ' s willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .	389.0999
even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending her debut as lucia in donizetti ' s `` lucia di lammermoor ' ' sunday night .	623.7568
the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic `` mad scene ' ' created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .	1090.7334
her entrance in scene 2 , act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note .	1169.6282
thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization .	6532.1445
as she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` lucia ' ' .	1016.6015
each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` mad scene ' ' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .	397.87177
miss sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene a much more girlish lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .	1478.0249
what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today .	6549.1924
this big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined .	1917.772
nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm up slowly .	659.24426
in the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .	1073.4631
technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic .	2802.0752
many years have passed since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable .	1603.2611
her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine .	1094.1776
the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , silvio varviso .	1913.5792
he injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .	250.08968
he may respect too much the italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers ' opera may be quite difficult .	541.07825
richard tucker sang edgardo in glorious voice .	622.04004
his bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction .	482.152
the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable .	2127.6658
miss sutherland first sang lucia at covent garden in 1959 .	3650.316
( the first metropolitan opera broadcast on dec . 9 will introduce her as lucia .	850.3499
) she has since turned to bellini , whose opera `` beatrice di tenda ' ' in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her to new york last season .	481.98648
she will sing `` la sonambula ' ' with it here next week .	635.7415
it ' s really quite fun -- as long as you like games .	480.30774
you will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new london `` phase 4 ' ' records .	654.04694
there are 12 of these to choose from , all of them of popular music except for the star release , pass in review ( sp-44001 ) .	452.98175
this features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand .	1164.982
complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays london ' s new technique to the best effect .	1041.4298
all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program .	754.96893
no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music .	269.0064
directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time	235.12276
but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music .	235.7084
you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back .	739.5775
this is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound .	1347.6083
london explains that the very distinct directional effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .	794.07086
these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record .	433.12683
in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects .	826.85114
some clue to the character of london ' s approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion ' ' or `` percussive ' ' .	193.40329
drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well .	1700.6195
only too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right .	264.89404
they are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley .	583.76404
the percussive twenties ( sp-44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and johnny keating ' s kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive moods ( sp-44005 ) .	2222.1875
big band percussion ( sp-44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just didn ' t have so much character as the others .	349.87265
there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies .	615.524
the penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in melody and percussion for two pianos ( sp-44007 ) .	1667.2948
all of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface noise .	1130.5676
pass in review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system .	590.39746
many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic .	293.33517
strange , but true -- authenticity and realism often aren ' t related at all .	429.03345
almost every film bearing the imprimatur of hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so .	1178.4543
in any given period piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity .	1588.4325
the major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter .	853.2735
during the making recently of an important biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with .	1564.1074
but , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set ' s edge .	185.61707
the drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all .	793.2625
thus , in `` the story of ruth ' ' we have ruth , naomi , and boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic .	3131.8745
but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i . e . , that ruth remained with naomi and finally wound up with boaz -- the film version has little to do with the bible .	552.97266
and in the new `` king of kings ' ' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the gospels .	1220.6084
earlier this month edward r . murrow , director of the united states information agency , came to hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry .	410.5016
he talked about unauthentic storylines too .	21185.857
he intimated that they weren ' t doing the country much good in the cold war .	266.94263
and to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .	1747.1074
`` in many corners of the globe ' ' , he said , `` the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet .	143.84381
would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge ? ?	1902.5203
yet for much of the globe , hollywood is just that -- prime , if not sole , source of knowledge .	870.80676
if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone , what conclusions do you think he might come to ? ?	452.29562
francois d ' albert , hungarian-born violinist who made his new york debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in judson hall .	1032.401
he is now president of the chicago conservatory college .	388.74573
his pianist was donald jenni , a faculty member at depaul university .	1569.9948
the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , mr . jenni ' s playing was too loud .	345.94214
in vying with him , mr . d ' albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone .	221.79752
this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , mozart ' s sonata in a ( k . 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion .	814.5154
brahm ' s sonata in a , although also vigorous , stood up well under the two artists ' strong , large-scale treatment .	408.08057
mr . d ' albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato .	1120.1681
he made the most of the long brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance .	547.9909
a sonata for violin and piano , called `` bella bella ' ' , by robert fleming , was given its first united states performance .	431.8507
the title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the national film board of canada .	218.47905
the work ' s two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom .	3043.5376
they might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of hollywood .	2520.2222
works by dohnanyi , hubay , mr . d ' albert himself and paganini , indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase .	1665.6079
standard items by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program .	917.979
in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium , but her program last night at town hall was the greek-born pianist ' s first new york recital since 1948 .	751.5384
miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control .	674.12225
and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound .	2868.1936
since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure .	1115.2611
she played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures .	696.762
the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers of this century .	389.11514
it was in them that miss xydis was at her best .	513.97375
the rachmaninoff prelude no . 12 , op . 32 , for instance , gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble .	1547.4581
the four kabalevsky preludes were also assured , rich in color and songful .	1184.9807
and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that prokofieff needs .	8897.655
miss xydis ' earlier selections were mendelssohn ' s variations serieuses , in which each variation was nicely set off from the others	977.8081
haydn ' s sonata in e minor , which was unfailingly pleasant in sound , and chopin ' s sonata in b flat minor .	829.84674
a memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist ' s performance .	417.15594
so , what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing .	993.48346
miss xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing .	201.89069
all the generals who held important commands in world war 2 , did not write books .	270.81467
it only seems as if they did .	143.01353
and the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written .	1400.856
one of the very best is only now published in this country , five years after its first publication in england .	244.4736
it is `` defeat into victory ' ' , by field marshal viscount slim .	535.25995
a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally .	790.03424
field marshal slim has abridged it for the benefit of `` those who , finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , are more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger ' ' .	674.4927
the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the field marshal himself .	267.5297
william joseph slim , first viscount slim , former governor general of australia , was the principal british commander in the field during the burma war .	643.47314
he had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped british forces `` were outmaneuvered , outfought and outgeneraled ' ' .	2845.0889
he returned in command of an international army of gurkhas , indians , africans , chinese and british .	832.2069
and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war .	614.52423
`` the forgotten war ' ' his soldiers called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines .	1398.1025
parts of `` defeat into victory ' ' are a tangle of burmese place names and military units , but a little application makes everything clear enough .	637.0156
on the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book .	2240.694
field marshal slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes .	1126.581
he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even `` a cardinal error ' ' .	393.22855
he himself seems to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers .	1386.7377
`` defeat into victory ' ' is a dramatic and lively military narrative .	188.28299
but it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action .	473.70258
before he could return to burma , field marshal slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits .	1529.1357
his remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening .	614.9962
he believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many .	513.3416
he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there .	290.65506
for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers , when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly .	651.09766
other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale was vital , too	2622.4128
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with top brass -- british , american and chinese	1236.8141
health , hygiene , medical aid and preventive medicine	2678.5762
hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty )	6121.1035
roads and river barges to be built .	124.24815
commenting on these and other matters , field marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks	3063.2163
`` when in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder ' ' .	247.4592
`` the commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty ' ' .	224.50319
`` it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them .	1911.8765
so i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it ' ' .	261.25885
field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders .	333.904
of the japanese private he says `` he fought and marched till he died .	566.5105
if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position , we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves ' ' .	341.87985
brooding about future wars , the field marshal has this to say `` the asian fighting man is at least equally brave ( as the white ) , usually more careless of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him .	977.8422
he is , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources ' ' .	578.36523
a bunch of young buckaroos from out west , who go by the name of texas boys choir , loped into town hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience .	906.62775
actually , the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sang it beautifully .	3084.4575
under the capable direction of the choir ' s founder , geroge bragg , the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from pergolesi ' s `` stabat mater ' ' and all of the britten `` ceremonial of carols ' ' .	1028.949
their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing .	757.9372
the limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now and then a bleat .	4238.335
but mr . bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior .	586.5761
most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words .	338.4246
the latin , for example , was not only clear	283.87253
furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music .	207.51707
lines came out neatly and in good balance .	272.67944
the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish .	16654.68
a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly .	14537.973
other capable soloists included david clifton , joseph schockler and pat thompson .	1648.3441
the final group included folk songs from back home , stomped out , shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume .	4654.9404
boys will be boys , and texans will be texans .	447.33456
the combination proved quite irresistible last night .	266.78778
the polish song and dance company called mazowsze , after the region of poland , where it has its headquarters , opened a three-week engagement at the city center last night .	532.49786
a thoroughly ingratiating company it is , and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening .	376.66348
not that it is all funny , by any means , though some of it is definitely so , but simply that the dancers are young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied .	438.49557
there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it has a kind of nonstop format , and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification .	885.66754
the material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of poland .	1031.0172
but under the direction of mira ziminska-sygietynska , who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treated selectively , choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators , and performed altogether professionally .	1549.0867
under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing .	584.85956
since the organization was created thirteen years ago , it is obvious that this is not the original company	285.06552
it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company .	375.02185
the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters .	612.9442
the stage is constantly full of them	301.84705
indeed , there are never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that is only for the more intimate numbers .	879.7123
they can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull .	939.72046
to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed .	505.72336
there is , for example , a stunning krakowiak that closes the first act	1854.9548
the mazurka choreographed by witold zapala to music from moniuszko ' s opera , `` strasny dwor ' , may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see	2222.0232
and the dances and songs from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men .	924.2634
everywhere there are little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth .	1096.3456
the theatre-by-the-sea , matunuck , presents `` king of hearts ' ' by jean kerr and eleanor brooke .	2098.7205
producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season ' s opener at matunuck in jean kerr ' s `` king of hearts ' ' .	448.67508
the dialogue is sharp , witty and candid -- typical `` don ' t eat the daisies ' ' material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience liked it .	780.96295
the story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material .	1763.7286
this is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero ' s sweetheart-secretary .	421.11417
john heffernan , playing larry larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion .	1919.5231
this may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of david hedison , providence ' s contribution to hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th century-fox .	719.4513
not that mr . hedison does not make the most of his role .	240.06021
but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way .	262.26413
a word should be said for gary morgan , a broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and larkin in particular .	1069.2368
and for his playmate , francis coletta of west warwick , who has a bit part , billy .	1057.128
on the whole , audiences will like this performance .	964.7846
it is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the matunuck cast does well by it .	699.82074
the newport playhouse presents `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' by john osborne and anthony creighton , directed by wallace gray .	2470.6023
the angriest young man in newport last night was at the playhouse , where `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' opened as the jazz festival closed .	456.0233
for the hero of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session .	1204.173
he ' s mad at a world he did not make .	111.55732
furthermore , he ' s something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips .	910.20483
this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards .	770.4642
they not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well .	3962.573
it is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that george dillon enters at the beginning of the play .	959.91266
an unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists .	294.11295
by the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells .	666.7936
not altogether a successful play , `` epitaph for george dillon ' ' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling .	591.69196
it is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive .	123.99544
but it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .	472.57635
there is a fine second act , as an example , one in which samuel groom , as dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another .	725.3997
this is an exciting young actor to watch .	569.80164
just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch .	1061.2645
miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment .	2926.4854
also fine are sue lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , harold cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and hildy weissman , as a vegetable in human form .	2387.5095
wallace gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste .	397.6421
still , his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair .	969.57025
the warwick musical theater presents `` where ' s charley ? ?	647.7572
' ' with music and lyrics by frank loesser , directed by christopher hewett , choreography by peter conlow , musical direction by samuel matlowsky .	970.14514
everybody fell in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater , and shelley berman was to blame .	509.49393
one of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented , `` once in love with amy ' ' is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of american musical comedy in our era .	717.11676
so the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 , got a rousing opening chorus , `` where ' s charley ? ?	729.9762
' ' , and berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being .	1609.1893
it is greatly to berman ' s credit that he made no attempt to outdo ray bolger .	1324.4349
he dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called `` charley ' s aunt ' ' , and let himself go with as appealing an `` amy ' ' as anybody could ask .	464.21283
in brief , berman played himself and not bolger .	2075.4578
the big audience started applauding even before he had finished .	1414.8015
the whole production this week is fresh and lively .	655.6294
the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days .	3407.4302
the ballet work is on the nose , especially in the opening number by `` the new ashmolean marching society and students ' conservatory band ' ' , along with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later .	913.43097
berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy .	801.0097
sparrow-size virginia gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky amy , while melisande congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best gibson girl manner .	2384.3196
all told , `` where ' s charley ? ?	311.82486
' ' ought not to be missed .	249.1876
it has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , mr . berman .	390.1632
the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c . edwin knill ' s and martin tahse ' s production of `` fiorello ! !	306.44186
the book is by jerome weidman and george abbott , music by jerry bock , lyrics by sheldon harnick , choreography by peter gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by william and jean eckart , musical direction by jack elliott , and the production was directed by mr . abbott .	1151.9479
this is one of the happier events of the season .	115.45638
the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the little flower rides to break a lance again .	1581.2654
' ' performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company is every bit as good , and perhaps better .	329.46075
certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking .	1587.8154
bob carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley does , but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch one ' s self up and remember that this wasn ' t really laguardia come back among us again .	662.11993
then rudy bond was simply grand as ben , the distraught republican party district chieftain .	2887.9312
and paul lipson , as morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his shirley ' s dinner , was fine , too .	306.41
as for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man .	564.80347
charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie , who became the second mrs . laguardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction .	656.93463
jen nelson , as thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive .	1285.9158
and little zeme north , a dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings .	1108.6514
such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` on the side of the angels ' ' and `` politics and poker ' ' were handled splendidly , and i thought rudy bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` little tin box ' ' even better than it was done by the new york cast	594.86005
all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity .	1295.541
the party at floyd ' s penthouse gave the `` chorines ' ' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era ' s nonsense .	967.989
laguardia ' s multi-lingual rallies , when he is running for congress , are well staged , and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater .	569.91144
martin tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions .	1677.5055
not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .	273.24875
the sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that doesn ' t pause long in any one place , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness .	711.85986
( several times recently i have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes .	651.4753
i ' m glad to say there ' s none of that distraction in this `` fiorello ! !	285.75903
it has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater .	884.1746
loew ' s theater presents `` where the boys are ' ' , an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells .	1177.0437
since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich brown senior , while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists , i suppose i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` where the boys are ' ' , but i shall do nothing of the sort .	739.4721
instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- i hasten to report that it ' s a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say , sex .	779.1044
the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .	2901.4812
if most of them weren ' t exactly specific -- well , that ' s the way it is in life , i guess .	331.8284
but at least it ' s reassuring to see some teenagers who don ' t profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead .	368.03864
`` where the boys are ' ' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .	688.5283
there are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid ' ' is performing .	2257.51
most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar .	347.08337
dolores hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable .	827.113
i was delighted with paula prentiss ' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one ' s highest hopes might ask .	1129.6871
a couple of the males made good comedy , too -- jim hutton and frank gorshin .	3063.2249
the only performance which was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , i suppose this was the attitude the part called for .	729.9933
i must say , however , that i preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it .	383.3712
to anyone who remembers newport at its less than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertaining .	1013.7944
the second feature , `` the price of silence ' ' , is a british detective story that will talk your head off .	331.15897
the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters .	898.14417
here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking .	503.55142
to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment .	959.32733
for this latest addition to the great letters series , under the general editorship of louis kronenberger , miss hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of james ' s genius , not to mention the felicities of his style .	698.18115
and how he could write ! !	118.59042
his famous criticism of brother henry ' s `` third style ' ' is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter ' s intricate air castles as henry himself could ever have produced .	1113.0669
his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor .	1448.2289
most of all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain whitehead ' s reference to james as `` that adorable genius ' ' .	842.45966
miss hardwick speaks of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship ' ' , and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism .	808.47943
this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought .	453.0986
it holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual ' ' has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues .	554.1341
to his harvard colleague , josiah royce , whose philosophic position differed radically from his own , james could write , `` different as our minds are , yours has nourished mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you i have always felt that my life was being lived importantly ' ' .	824.6021
of another colleague , george santayana , he could write `` the great event in my life recently has been the reading of santayana ' s book .	376.47495
although i absolutely reject the platonism of it , i have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page ' ' .	862.5762
writing to his colleague george herbert palmer -- `` glorious old palmer ' ' , as he addresses him -- james says that if only the students at harvard could really understand royce , santayana , palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for ' ' , then harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe .	739.1679
`` the best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems .	218.48518
the world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other ' ' .	937.7285
the `` belaboring ' ' is of course jocular , yet james was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of god .	974.66
to james this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of it in others .	372.1212
but there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent `` you ask what i am going to ' reply ' to bradley .	690.1544
but why need one reply to everything and everybody ? ?	431.20953
i think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations .	13762.597
all polemic of ours should , i believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treated singly , and as far as possible impersonally .	985.426
as far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other .	1397.4501
here again ' god will know his own ' ' ' .	73.71334
the collected works of james thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows .	1726.3044
the primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall , is equally well known .	1756.3088
about all that remains to be said is that the present selection , most of which appeared first in the new yorker , comprises ( as usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book .	727.47076
the one unifying note , if any , is sounded in the initial article entitled `` how to get through the day ' ' .	165.77136
it is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and others forced to rely on inner resources , including ( in the p ' s alone ) `` palindromes ' ' , `` paraphrases ' ' , and `` parodies ' ' .	586.8072
`` the tyranny of trivia ' ' suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber .	8425.456
and new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled `` friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ear-muffs ' ' , `` such a phrase as drifts through dream ' ' , and `` the new vocabularianism ' ' .	1135.307
some of thurber ' s curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases .	2671.8218
a burlesque paean entitled `` hark the herald tribune , times , and all the other angels sing ' ' brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey .	4362.819
`` how the kooks crumble ' ' features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-tv commercials , and `` the watchers of the night ' ' is a veritable waking nightmare .	4607.4536
a semi-serious literary document entitled `` the wings of henry james ' ' is noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master ' s difficult later period by modest owen wister , author of `` the virginian ' ' .	902.6166
james , he remarks in a letter to a friend , `` is attempting the impossible namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produces upon the gazer , a number of superimposed , simultaneous impressions .	465.84177
he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once , and get all at once , the various shadings and complexities ' ' .	392.05765
equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation `` so much has already been written about everything that you can ' t find out anything about it ' ' .	214.51561
or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) `` woman ' s place is in the wrong ' ' .	226.74849
who but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences ? ?	5806.7354
a tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes ' ' seems terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why .	315.12723
`` one of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped out of sleep and out of bed .	1668.6143
' it ' s just a bat ' , said my wife reassuringly , and i sighed with relief .	1228.6465
' thank god for that ' , i said	113.16366
' i thought it was a human being ' ' ' .	46.754112
in a sense , perhaps , thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it salvador dali ? ?	4226.239
) who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen .	537.9376
that is , it is literally a picture window you don ' t see into the viscera	273.58432
you see a picture -- trees , or flowers .	381.45615
this is something like what thurber ' s best effects are like , if i am not mistaken .	322.81137
though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness .	2795.832
in his concluding paragraph he writes `` the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can ' ' .	206.6708
for many readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight .	2332.5867
the latest low is a puzzler .	4057.75
the master ' s hand has lost none of its craft .	493.9473
he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties .	1431.8201
the reader meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse , and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race , her hair standing straight out .	1281.6674
but there is a difference between the present volume and the early low .	299.63846
there is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show .	672.2015
but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning .	669.9417
anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference .	393.4058
it might be argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key .	601.7579
but this argument cannot be pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion .	607.09
the communists wield a power unknown to hitler .	1931.2555
and the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same .	600.773
do we ourselves offer mr . low less of a crusade ? ?	289.29434
in the thirties we would not face our enemy	295.05167
that was a nightmarish situation and low was in his element .	235.72221
now we have stood up to the communists	150.95476
we are stronger and more self-confident -- and low cannot so easily put us to rights .	3455.2717
or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere ? ?	3619.3813
it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now .	1145.3173
he writes , `` confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime ' ' .	877.414
whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic .	1443.8512
he does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man .	160.001
the skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath .	1064.6708
low seems to have supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently , so there is no fire in his eye .	751.3227
stalin ' s death , churchill ' s farewell to public life , hillary and tensing on everest , quemoy and matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade .	1881.9994
instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles .	1296.2393
did low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections ? ?	310.16043
and khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all .	952.46704
look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale .	2346.1611
read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas .	597.0664
a gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man , city slicker , lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over catfish bend in this third relaxed allegory from mr . burman ' s refreshing louisiana animal community .	1803.7721
the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from new orleans , accompanied by one wharf rat .	3049.2175
but like all despots , as he builds his following from among the gullible , he grows more threatening toward those who won ' t follow -- such solid citizens as doc raccoon	1269.7079
and the eagle , who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in washington posing for fifty-cent pieces .	1449.5935
as soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats , who , of course , say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city .	944.28326
( the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others .	2482.9485
) they train the mink and other animals to fight .	634.8618
and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won ' t have anyone around that ' s against him , and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds .	612.9936
robert hillyer , the poet , writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that mr . burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish bend series .	917.8026
he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes .	12994.302
but it ' s hard to imagine mr . burman as a nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables .	849.57294
in substance they lie somewhere between the southern dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris ( uncle remus ) and the polished , witty fables of james thurber .	1785.0756
george kennan ' s account of relations between russia and the west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 , is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years .	258.29996
it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era ' s great historical issues .	440.89725
in short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at harvard university , is both reliable and readable	2104.9924
the author possesses an uncommonly fine english style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time .	817.2862
if mr . kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging .	771.9182
mr . kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken .	1715.9332
but he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the yalta conference in february , 1945 .	801.4165
after all , alger hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret state department documents to soviet agents , was at yalta .	2828.1758
and harry dexter white , implicated in f . b . i . reports in communist associations , was one of the architects of the morgenthau plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed germany to stalin .	317.06284
one item in this unhappy scheme was to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength .	1934.7101
it is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender ' ' had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with communism .	520.0693
mr . kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way	446.83444
`` you see , first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy ' s power , no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future ' ' .	357.61194
recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with hitler , he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-nazi underground , which very nearly eliminated hitler in 1944 .	817.28937
a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language , history and literature , kennan recalls how , at the time of hitler ' s attack on the soviet union in 1941 , he penned a private note to a state department official , expressing the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries ' ' .	411.8346
with justified bitterness the author speaks of `` what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happened in the purges , and about what had been going on in poland and the baltic states ' ' .	309.04285
he also speaks of franklin d . roosevelt ' s `` puerile ' ' assumption that `` if only he ( stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like f . d . r . himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and russia ' s co-operation with the west could be easily arranged ' ' .	374.79553
no wonder khrushchev ' s first message to president kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days ' ' of roosevelt .	181.40598
this fascinating story begins with a sketch , rich in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of world war 1 , and the two instalments of the russian revolution .	507.35904
the first of these involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government in march , 1917	1227.3168
the second , the seizure of power by the bolsheviks ( who later called themselves communists ) in november of the same year .	467.0368
as kennan shows , the judgment of the allied governments about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession of defeating germany .	827.51263
they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fighting .	439.63113
they attributed everything that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue .	646.526
this , more than any other factor , led to the fiasco of allied intervention .	824.8888
as the author very justly says	27453.008
`` had a world war not been in progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have been an allied intervention in north russia ' ' .	383.02567
the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by communist propaganda	1088.6456
here kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking .	1693.613
of many passages in the book that exemplify the author ' s vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected .	2146.1033
`` this was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits	2273.4246
a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity	417.82584
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe	8260.178
a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment	163.33064
a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime .	806.6584
and here is kennan ' s image of hitler , stalin ' s temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy	509.79483
`` behind that charlie chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed -- like stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift stalin did not possess the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word ' ' .	1343.2842
two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan .	1052.3683
and in a concluding chapter about america ' s stance in the contemporary world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war .	832.53754
but one should not ask for everything .	277.72562
mr . kennan , who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia , is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future .	645.94946
the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator .	495.18088
the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm .	1651.558
in `` donnybrook ' ' , there is quite a different eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing are the thing .	725.8343
there is plenty of violence , to be sure , but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed .	240.25787
by and large , robert mcenroe ' s adaptation of maurice walsh ' s film , `` the quiet man ' ' , provides the entertainment it set out to , and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one .	434.4641
this is the tale of one john enright , an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man .	392.4233
but innesfree , where ellen roe danaher and her bullying brother , will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists .	1043.6023
so enright ' s courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told .	2691.2712
you may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means .	749.1919
then there is a matchmaker , one mikeen flynn , a role for which eddie foy was happily selected .	3621.4148
now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play .	933.92126
mr . foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect .	638.8591
his matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony .	1081.5833
art lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonates enright .	1850.977
although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique , that ' s not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have , anyway .	925.69824
joan fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays ellen , and sings the role very well , too .	955.42505
if the mettle which ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind	3225.3428
she fits into the general scheme well enough .	2057.735
susan johnson , as the widow , spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one .	548.4627
she has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening .	480.91916
then there are a pair of old biddies played by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock irish characters , but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they ' re quite entertaining .	1998.1832
and in the role of will danaher , philip bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british army , if he chose .	1403.7593
`` donnybrook ' ' is no `` brigadoon ' ' , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing .	434.4581
the ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent .	324.83786
it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of it , such as the catchy `` sez i ' ' , does .	354.64374
`` a toast to the bride ' ' , sung by clarence nordstrom , playing a character called old man toomey , is quite simple , direct and touching .	677.83746
the men of innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing is fine .	2015.9448
so is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under jack cole ' s expert choreographic direction .	7251.583
the male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating .	2015.6642
rouben ter-arutunian , in his stage settings , often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr . cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow .	869.2349
there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at `` donnybrook ' ' , unless they are permanently in the mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable irish .	706.563
we can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously , too -- because joshua logan has turned the stage show , `` fanny ' ' , into a delightful and heart-warming film .	1174.6053
the task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnol ' s original trio of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting them again on the screen , after their passage through the broadway musical idiom , was a delicate and perilous one , indeed .	860.1077
more than the fans of pagnol ' s old films and of their heroic star , the great raimu , were looking askance at the project .	793.64954
the fans of the musical were , too .	348.6757
but now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music hall yesterday .	808.72186
whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show , whether partial to music or not , you can ' t help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart .	546.3026
some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow .	2700.536
a tiny handful never did make the concert .	112.558876
but , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon ' s proceedings .	652.61664
they faced a rather small audience , as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon .	444.63336
paul paray , rounding out his current stint with the orchestra , is a solid musician , and the philharmonic plays for him .	354.67014
their collaboration in the beethoven second symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding .	5222.527
it was not a heavy , ponderous beethoven .	6348.203
the music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced .	3988.8445
the franck symphonic poem , `` psyche ' ' , is a lush , sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again .	492.4464
fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor	313.26495
if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying .	10092.802
mr . paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score .	535.5658
he did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical .	1295.622
his interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy .	664.31335
and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto , with zadel skolovsky as soloist , he was an admirable partner .	3375.4077
mr . skolovsky ' s approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive .	1330.3048
he swept through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner .	1404.2621
an impressive technician , mr . skolovsky has fine rhythm , to boot .	460.08667
his tone is the weakest part of his equipment	842.74567
it tends to be hard and colorless .	1782.5289
a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs .	1311.5327
it is , after all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement )	540.1345
and the composer himself was called the `` age of steel pianist ' ' .	313.20566
but granted all this , one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than mr . skolovsky supplied .	525.5808
taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra .	227.50868
mr . skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received .	986.70166
a new work on the program was nikolai lopatnikoff ' s `` festival overture ' ' , receiving its first new york hearing .	702.1766
this was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry .	248.5045
it is not program music , though .	208.81839
it runs a little more than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless .	2549.5356
`` la gioconda ' ' , like it or not , is a singer ' s opera .	103.932106
and so , of course , it is a fan ' s opera as well .	96.210396
snow or no , the fans were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work .	317.20483
so the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing .	876.20026
after all , the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed , with no less than six leading parts .	1497.7124
one of those parts is that of evil , evil barnaba , the spy .	1470.2401
his wicked deeds were carried on by anselmo colzani , who was taking the part for the first time with the company .	387.4525
he has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone .	986.3159
what was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after all , a very oily character .	424.08582
regina resnik as laura and cesare siepi as alvise also were new to the cast , but only with respect to this season	2001.0198
they have both sung these parts here before .	891.7117
laura is a good role for miss resnik , and she gave it force , dramatic color and passion .	962.47974
mr . siepi was , as always , a consummate actor	608.5055
with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently .	36387.92
part of this characterization was , of course , accomplished with the vocal chords .	443.41592
his singing was strong and musical	659.4883
unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality .	677.82227
eileen farrell in the title role , mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contributed to a vigorous performance .	4060.2349
if only they and fausto cleva in the pit had got together a bit more .	3180.9243
`` melodious birds sing madrigals ' ' saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could be imagined .	1424.4579
their vanguard album madrigal masterpieces ( bg 609	21691.617
stereo bgs 5031 ) is a good sample of the special , elegant art of english madrigal singing .	548.9717
it also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of italian and english madrigals plus several french `` chansons ' ' .	831.9387
the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else .	1600.8746
the original impulses came to england late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo , sonatas , operas and the like .	922.40106
even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together -- choruses , catches and glees -- always flourished .	4513.5996
the english never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in italy blotted out the italian madrigal .	1134.7686
latter-day interest in elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in england , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries .	406.24915
as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the english madrigal .	846.2955
naturally , mr . deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen william byrd , thomas morley and thomas tomkins .	1616.1478
there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture .	762.3091
both techniques give the music purity and clarity .	6543.848
claude jannequin ' s vocal description of a battle ( the french equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by jannequin and lassus .	1319.0312
only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of marenzio , monteverdi and gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial .	3097.581
nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period .	1165.1599
the elements of elegance and color in jannequin are strong french characteristics .	1109.5087
baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tends to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract .	664.36975
in france , it remained always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full of flavor .	1445.6554
couperin and rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of `` program music ' ' but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance .	865.62933
both composers turn up on new imports from france .	315.01633
bam is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is editions de la boite a musique .	1642.4668
they specialize in out-of-the-way items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention .	909.2791
sonates et concerts royaux of couperin le grand occupy two disks ( ld056 and ld060 ) and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate , flexible and gemlike .	2533.5786
the concerts -- nos . 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian sense .	447.46106
the sonatas , `` la francaise ' ' , `` la sultane ' ' , `` l ' astree ' ' and `` l ' imperiale ' ' , are often more elaborately worked out and , in fact , show a strong italian influence .	154.37634
couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called musique francaise du 18e siecle ( bam ld 060 ) .	455.9739
jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit , but bodin de beismortier , corrette and mondonville are hardly household words .	2088.464
what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo .	694.0155
the couperin `` la steinkerque ' ' , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shakes off corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era .	2043.3422
if couperin shows the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more .	378.75974
all these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic .	988.54767
rameau ' s six concerts en sextuor , recorded by l ' orchestre de chambre pierre menet ( bam ld 046 ) , turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself .	1489.593
the strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious .	2233.337
maitres allemands des 17e et 18e siecles contains music by pachelbel , buxtehude , rosenmueller and telemann , well performed by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket ( bam ld 035 ) .	2311.5635
rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in carnegie recital hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts .	883.2855
works by j . c . bach , anton craft , joseph haydn , giuseppe sammartini , comenico dragonetti and j . g . janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff , flutist , josef marx , oboist , and robert conant , pianist and harpsichordist .	4133.507
since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven to boulez .	1558.5074
thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday night .	1594.036
each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome .	1601.5886
the performances were variable , those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying .	1047.3278
ellie mao , soprano , and frederick fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled `` east meets west ' ' in carnegie recital hall last night .	1025.8151
they were accompanied by anna mi lee , pianist .	1623.3918
selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages .	1113.249
songs from china and japan were reserved exclusively for miss mao , who is a native of china , and those of the british isles were sung by mr . fuller , who is english by birth .	311.1894
this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles .	1671.3848
on the contrary , miss mao and mr . fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as mendelssohn , dvorak , canteloube , copland and britten .	1337.361
there was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise .	242.61343
the performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal .	9381.177
what was omitted from `` a neglected education ' ' were those essentials known as `` the facts of life ' ' .	270.4501
chabrier ' s little one-act operetta , presented yesterday afternoon at town hall , is a fragile , precious little piece , very french , not without wit and charm .	1370.1556
the poor uneducated newlywed , a certain gontran de boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information .	489.20166
the humor of the situation can be imagined .	183.46121
it all takes place in the eighteenth century .	23.864355
what a silly , artificial way of life , chabrier and his librettists chuckle .	2926.5354
but they wish they could bring it back .	125.23376
chabrier ' s delightful music stands just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( handed down to chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism .	1812.7515
the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish .	2800.8984
the simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes .	813.83405
arlene saunders was charming as poor gontran .	3182.302
yes , arlene is her name	1270.6854
the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano .	700.5409
benita valente was delightful as the young wife and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring .	657.9086
the work was presented as the final event in the town hall festival of music .	246.85909
it was paired with a darius milhaud opera , `` the poor sailor ' ' , set to a libretto by jean cocteau , a kind of grand guignol by the sea , a sailor returns , unrecognized , and gets done in by his wife .	831.7023
with the exception of a few spots , milhaud ' s music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration .	3056.0618
had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon .	763.0583
sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5 , 500 other people .	472.04865
i make this observation about the lady , miss judy garland , because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote in the paper the next day	826.0232
`` judy garland has arrived in london .	165.42409
but who cares , when the lady sings ? ?	298.22192
certainly not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet .	1240.7877
they applauded every number , not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord .	238.34541
and judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed , at times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings .	1207.2137
things like `` when you ' re smiling ' ' , `` almost like being in love ' ' , `` do it again ' ' , `` born to wander ' ' , `` alone together ' ' , `` who cares ? ?	101.549164
' ' , `` puttin ' on the ritz ' ' , `` how long has this been going on ? ?	513.5972
' ' and her own personal songs like `` the man that got away ' ' , and the inevitable `` over the rainbow ' ' .	210.60628
miss garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen .	327.24527
at the start of her program there were evidences of pique .	1231.4032
she had held to the letter of her contract and didn ' t come onto the stage until well after 4 p . m . , the appointed hour , although the music at newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 .	211.57861
then there was a bad delay in getting mort lindsey ' s 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs .	6362.8286
along about 4 30 , just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , judy came on singing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind .	557.4003
her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing .	680.30457
in her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm . lenses and shoot at extreme range .	3973.7368
there also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` do it again ' ' , and she made the tart observation that `` i never saw so much moving about in an audience ' ' .	471.79706
but it didn ' t take judy garland , showman , long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at newport and that you have to learn to live with it .	370.43167
before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music , trundling microphones about the stage , helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere .	1358.7853
and time after time she really belted out her songs .	844.8649
sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way i felt about her `` come rain or come shine ' ' -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful `` beautiful weather ' ' .	1220.7261
to her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise	1311.7542
they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more , as though they could never get enough .	324.3896
they were rewarded with splendid , exciting , singing .	2070.7466
her `` rockabye your baby ' ' was as good as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like `` the man that got away ' ' were deeply moving .	231.78535
the audience wouldn ' t let her leave until it had heard `` over the rainbow ' ' -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` get happy ' ' had to go home unhappy , about that item anyway .	426.61053
she was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers .	1161.1244
all went home happy except the newport police , who feared that the throng departing at 6 35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh , and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar .	1592.1118
in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies .	1302.0493
this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance , but no storm .	172.00981
several times it came near breaking , and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from jerry mulligan ' s big band , which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond found count basie working in a kansas city trap .	1329.2129
mulligan ' s band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations .	676.2149
but what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan ' s baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer ' s arrangement of `` django ' s castle ' ' .	605.5698
for subtle swinging rhythms , i could admire intensely mulligan ' s version of `` weep ' ' , and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 carrots for robert ' ' , a sax tribute to johnny hodges .	447.60403
there was considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messengers , who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group .	716.39636
unfortunately , blakey doesn ' t choose to work much of the time in this vein .	60.416378
he prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like .	1247.8872
what we did get , however , was impressive .	78.39971
a few drops of rain just before midnight , when sarah vaughan was in the midst of her first number , scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with sarah on the stand , most of the listeners didn ' t care whether they got wet .	550.1562
miss vaughan was back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine .	419.65244
after the spate of female vocalists we have been having , all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever .	471.81598
the evening program was opened by the jazz three , a newport group consisting of steve budieshein on bass , jack warner , drums , and don cook , piano .	1688.7206
this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night when the eddie stack group , also local talent , went on first .	549.26465
putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot , when the audience is cold , restless , and in flux	1008.0003
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience .	332.21912
the jazz three displayed their sound musicianship , not only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for al minns & leon james , the superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program .	1140.857
julie wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sang a set , a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as `` hard-hearted hannah , the vamp of savannah ' ' , and the delightful `` sunday ' ' .	916.6686
she frosted the cake with the always reliable `` bill bailey ' ' .	308.67746
from this taste of the 1920s , we leaped way out to stan getz ' s private brand of progressive jazz , which did lovely , subtle things for `` baubles , bangles and beads ' ' , and a couple of ballards .	1160.1283
getz is a difficult musician to categorize .	6220.2134
he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over .	1197.557
in this he is sticking with tradition , however far removed from it he may seem to be .	331.89355
george shearing took over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consisting of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , shearing ' s piano and a bongo drummer .	1384.5876
he met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to latin american things like the mambo .	1127.9636
shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport appearances .	640.81964
a very casual , pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make newport ' s afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach .	769.4098
divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted of `` the evolution of the blues ' ' , narrated by jon hendricks , who had presented it last year at the monterey , calif . , jazz festival , and an hour-long session of maynard ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big band .	599.37036
hendricks ' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him .	302.39923
tracing the blues from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the west indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches .	349.6655
to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had `` big ' ' miller , as a preacher-singer and hannah dean , gospel-singer , while oscar brown jr . , an extremely talented young man , did a slave auctioneer ' s call , a field-hands ' work song , and a beautifully sung negro lullaby , `` brown baby ' ' , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival .	573.6357
one of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones , drumming to `` old man river ' ' , which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year ' s concerts .	479.6749
demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues was michael babatunde olatunji , who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest .	2496.3242
he has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year ' s afternoon concerts .	285.2563
hendricks had billy mitchell , tenor sax	11878.954
jimmy witherspoon , blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the ike isaacs trio , which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now , helping him with the musical examples .	606.6629
pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in schubert ' s sonatas .	331.05667
music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example , played for rca by emil gilels .	1333.001
he has chosen sonata op . 53 in aj .	210.54202
the playing takes both sides of the disc .	160.59981
perhaps one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length .	1092.2974
rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one ' s attention with the gilels playing .	522.15753
his technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully .	1015.5448
the male chorus of the robert shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style .	7182.756
what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question .	276.2748
do you say chantey , as if the word were derived from the french word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin , which derives its name from the french-canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard ? ?	753.2861
either way , the robert shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening .	3633.0898
if your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one .	221.37013
the london label offers an operatic recital by ettore bastianini , a baritone whose fame is international .	2282.86
murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` signal ' ' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` journal ' ' .	397.71814
`` signal ' ' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais .	1172.0747
its abstract decor is by john hultberg .	7190.3086
this urgent visage beckons us ' ' .	435.39902
here , as in `` journal ' ' , mr . louis has given himself the lion ' s share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements .	312.367
indeed , both `` journal ' ' and `` signal ' ' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics .	1136.1833
but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing .	532.1336
one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development .	514.18756
it may be , of course , that mr . louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation .	433.05725
but it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time .	455.04752
one thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be .	566.05634
a brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary american mores entitled `` an american journey ' ' was given its first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night by the helen tamiris-daniel nagrin dance company .	1607.6493
choreographed by mr . nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' as well as her `` women ' s song ' ' and mr . nagrin ' s `` indeterminate figure ' ' .	194.65343
eugene lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` an american journey ' ' , and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes .	1170.6766
mr . nagrin has described four `` places ' ' , each with its scenery and people , added two `` diversions ' ' , and concluded with `` a toccata for the young ' ' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock ' n ' roll dancing .	592.0786
the `` places ' ' could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody ' s , and the laugh is on us all .	361.15167
but we need not mind too much , because mr . nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way .	566.50104
miss tamiris ' `` once upon a time ' ' is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures ' ' that bother them somehow .	237.86313
unfortunately , the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so .	407.5876
nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time .	602.6949
the music here , russell smith ' s `` tetrameron ' ' , sounded good .	301.8476
all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with mr . nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers , seemed to be fine shape .	362.6478
the symphony of the air , greatly assisted by van cliburn , last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall off to a good start .	1358.4005
at the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at carnegie , and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs , repeating each of them in five different communities .	541.5323
this news , announced by jerome toobin , the orchestra ' s administrative director , brought applause from the 2 , 800 persons who filled the hall .	683.75385
they showed they were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln center of the new york philharmonic , the philadelphia orchestra and the boston symphony .	881.8357
this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county center in white plains .	828.1778
the details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in which they will be given , will be announced later , mr . toobin said .	160.54285
the concertos that van cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return from russia in 1958 have been the tchaikovsky , the rachmaninoff third , and the prokofieff third .	596.70776
it was pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded , `` the emperor ' ' .	139.70183
the young texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him .	1098.1177
but they were not what distinguished his performance .	1143.9943
the elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final rondo .	1308.3016
mr . cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne .	489.43658
alfred wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he is , picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding , poetic mystery .	727.7796
the collaboration was remarkable , as it was in both the other movements , too .	99.17932
mr . wallenstein , who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle , also conducted the `` leonore ' ' overture no . 3 and the fourth symphony .	338.3465
the orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively .	1984.3678
and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven .	554.1494
igor oistrakh will be the next soloist on feb . 4 .	634.75977
there are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in .	722.63336
today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it .	259.42776
in the more casually constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit .	851.3869
yet there is the classic case of the gershwins ' `` the man i love ' ' .	169.30042
deemed too static when it was first heard in `` lady be good ' ' in philadelphia in 1924 , it was dropped from the score .	162.15195
it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of `` strike up the band ' ' and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up .	362.03323
it finally reached broadway in the second and successful version of `` strike up the band ' ' in 1929 .	250.38023
( still another song in `` strike up the band ' ' -- `` i ' ve got a crush on you ' ' -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure , `` treasure girl ' ' .	148.31052
like the gershwins , richard rodgers and lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them .	1936.6825
if one of mr . rodgers ' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure , mr . hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show .	819.69
several of these double entries have been collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney , along with rodgers and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard rodgers and hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , rodgers and hart revisited ( spruce records , 505 fifth avenue , new york ) .	1884.3467
among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of `` the garrick gaieties ' ' , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from rodgers and hart in the years that followed	457.7068
dorothy loudon ' s raucous listing of the attractions `` at the roxy music hall ' ' from `` i married an angel ' '	814.4568
and the incisive style with which charlotte rae delivers the top-drawer hart lyrics of `` i blush ' ' , a song that was cut from `` a connecticut yankee ' ' .	876.6048
altogether fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists .	1269.5656
norman paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment	9176.018
turning to the current musical season on broadway , the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , how to succeed in business without really trying , has been transferred to an original cast album ( r . c . a . victor loc 1066	704.6983
stereo lso 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments , although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect .	619.14465
robert morse , singing with comically plaintive earnestness , carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in frank loesser ' s score .	931.5121
rudy vallee , who shares star billing with mr . morse , makes only two appearances .	565.6756
he shares with mr . morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice .	1100.276
in general , mr . loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer .	492.1863
like mr . loesser , jerry herman is both composer and lyriist for milk and honey ( r . c . a . victor loc 1065	1237.7279
stereo lso 1065 ) , but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics .	197.96254
for this story of an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel , mr . herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles .	979.14954
there are the full-bodied , resourceful voices of robert weede , mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the most of mr . herman ' s lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of molly picon .	1406.9491
mr . herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms .	1590.9636
not content to create only the music and lyrics , noel coward also wrote the book and directed sail away ( capitol wao 1643	2237.2788
stereo swao 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr . coward ' s more memorable works .	342.87064
the melodies flow along pleasantly , as mr . coward ' s songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality .	658.93536
elaine stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr . coward ' s songs .	538.91833
with three fine russian films in recent months on world war 2 , -- `` the house i live in ' ' , `` the cranes are flying ' ' and `` ballad of a soldier ' ' -- we had every right to expect a real soviet block-buster in `` the day the war ended ' ' .	252.47879
it simply isn ' t , not by a long shot .	117.08737
the artkino presentation , with english titles , opened on saturday at the cameo theatre .	1050.7742
make no mistake , this gorky studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave , carefully written , performed and directed .	2813.2878
in describing the initial allied occupation of a middle-sized german city , the picture has color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments .	2203.6897
told strictly from the viewpoint of the russian conquerors , the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict ' s aftermath .	844.60547
unfortunately , the whole picture hinges on this romance , at the expense of everything else .	583.75397
tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivets on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicated by nothing more than a friend they don ' t want to hurt .	603.8044
it ' s the old story , war or no war , and more than one viewer may recall hollywood ' s `` titanic ' ' , several seasons back , when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante .	666.1094
not that the picture is superficial .	622.5159
under yakov segal ' s direction , it begins stirringly , as crouching soviet and nazi troops silently scan each other , waiting for the first surrender gesture .	1797.5531
one high-up camera shot is magnificent , as the germans straggle from a cathedral , dotting a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons .	993.10175
ring of bright water , by gavin maxwell .	862.7691
only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience .	835.01355
`` ring of bright water ' ' by gavin maxwell is just that -- a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands .	824.37177
`` he has married me with a ring of bright water ' ' , begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys .	516.4782
the place is camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of skye .	2676.0535
it is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags , greylag geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters .	3624.331
how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience .	794.0807
just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough .	529.2667
there is mijbil , an otter who travelled with maxwell -- and gave maxwell ' s name to a new species -- from the tigris marshes to his london flat .	1447.4965
it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature .	237.20032
this is not only a compliment to mijbil , of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub ' s journey by plane from iraq to london , then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to camusfearna , with affectionate detail .	1028.3481
mij , as his owner was soon to learn , had strange , inexplicable habits .	644.2693
he liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth .	8109.7397
he preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow .	525.2073
systematically he would open and ransack drawers .	33671.754
given a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours .	710.5939
with curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so .	2242.1252
a year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader , one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted , but self-discovery as well .	326.80225
in the solitude of camusfearna there had been no loneliness .	1522.1549
`` to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating	1405.677
it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted , allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses ' ' .	420.67703
now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trusted implicitly by some creature .	1271.8577
two other people in time shared mijbil ' s love `` it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water	1269.8865
we were his trinity , and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation .	400.2956
in turn each of us in our own way depended , as gods do , upon his worship ' ' .	276.27087
the brief details of mijbil ' s death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy .	1463.5099
man , to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty , was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man .	1333.4161
but then , through a strange coincidence , maxwell manages to acquire idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story starts once more .	1655.2643
one is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or maxwell himself , poet , portrait painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life , in a language at once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed .	1292.2894
this reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement .	210.20094
now gavin maxwell ' s ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world .	840.9253
-- the performances of the comedie francaise are the most important recent events in the new york theater .	449.89212
they serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats , as accurately as possible , the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century .	536.2765
on the contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpreted , and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the comedie .	556.3862
of course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further reminds us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism .	1177.5842
the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the broadway producers who , in two instances this season , closed their plays after one performance .	737.6349
but they are aware of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic .	1192.3712
in france , novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempted .	1185.6873
the government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put moliere ' s characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results .	1137.2305
so far as i know , the comedie has never put moliere ' s people in the costumes of the 20th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters .	219.49171
last season , the comedie ' s two principal experiments came to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine ' s `` phedre ' ' and moliere ' s `` school for wives ' ' .	265.4913
the new `` phedre ' ' was done in 17th century setting , instead of ancient greek	537.3925
perhaps that is the comedie ' s equivalent for thrusting this play ' s characters into our own time .	472.80557
the speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance .	1893.4519
a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent .	379.28113
the new `` school for wives ' ' was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character .	588.96204
among the moliere specialists of some years ago , louis jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while fernand ledoux , often performing at the comedie , made them more gross than moliere may have intended .	854.5504
apparently , jouvet and ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in `` the school for wives ' ' .	683.09454
i say `` apparently ' ' although i saw jouvet as arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death	1453.4938
by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy .	166.1639
arnolphe , it will be recalled , is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be .	1116.749
the part can lend itself to serious treatment	1365.0281
one influential french critic remarked `` pity for arnolphe comes with age ' ' .	494.6473
accordingly , at the comedie last year , jean meyer played a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy .	1001.8767
but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly .	1364.5667
wisely , the comedie has brought moliere ' s `` tartuffe ' ' on its tour and has left `` the school for wives ' ' at home .	158.9438
tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor ' s wife .	2514.9148
jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and ledoux , at the comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or so the historians tell us .	949.9411
louis seigner , who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux , is the tartuffe of the present production , which he himself directed .	906.70465
his tartuffe observes the golden mean .	1730.0629
his red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality .	11318.212
but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory	4308.3486
of course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation .	474.30515
occasionally , seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another .	2069.5
the whole role , by the way , is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen seigner in his other parts .	306.97803
his normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly .	3578.3745
here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness .	1749.9205
seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service .	253.69452
in that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the comedie .	370.5619
we are often told that the comedie has , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy , drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage .	1021.62726
seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company	420.15698
among his other parts are the leads in `` the bourgeois gentleman ' ' and `` the imaginary invalid ' ' .	173.17392
in moliere ' s farce , `` the tricks of scapin ' ' , robert hirsch undertakes another of the great roles .	761.8461
to begin with , scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master .	1753.4077
hirsch ' s scapin is healthy , cheerful , energetic , revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves .	1507.6343
hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world .	415.20975
and surely his scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody ' s servant .	721.5725
django reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , was a true artist , one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels .	1076.8447
there is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn ' t owe something to django .	512.38153
and django owed much to louis armstrong .	1061.2458
he told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records he bought in the flea market in paris .	1410.424
it was the first jazz he had heard .	478.0662
django , who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in belgium and who died in 1953 in france , was an extraordinary man .	1928.4406
most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette .	849.53766
and this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz .	688.94507
you can catch up with him -- if you haven ' t already -- on rca-victor ' s album .	455.0616
`` djangology ' ' , made up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of the hot club of france .	1627.215
this is a choice item and grappely deserves mention too , of course .	1721.0548
he is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin .	301.55356
they play `` minor swing ' ' , `` honeysuckle rose ' ' , `` beyond the sea ' ' , `` bricktop ' ' , `` heavy artillery ' ' , `` djangology ' ' , `` after you ' ve gone ' ' , `` where are you , my love ' ' ? ?	71.54121
`` i saw stars ' ' , `` lover man ' ' , `` menilmontant ' ' and `` swing 42 ' ' .	44.746475
all this is great proceedings -- get the minutes .	555.2836
kid ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz .	562.8143
he dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans .	633.16876
his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember .	462.70987
good time jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made .	2584.6702
he is starred against alvin alcorn , trumpet	38978.91
wellman braud , bass , and minor hall , drums .	238.07362
the set contains `` high society ' ' , `` do what ory say ' ' , `` down home rag ' ' , `` careless love ' ' , jazz me blues ' ' , `` weary blues ' ' , `` original dixieland one-step ' ' , `` bourbon street parade ' ' , `` panama ' ' , `` toot , toot , tootsie ' ' , `` oh didn ' t he ramble ' ' , `` beale street blues ' ' , `` maryland , my maryland ' ' , `` 1919 rag ' ' , `` eh , la bas ' ' , `` mood indigo ' ' , and `` bugle call rag ' ' .	213.4819
all this will serve to show off the ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems .	674.47437
mischa elman shared last night ' s lewisohn stadium concert with three american composers .	566.9378
his portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin to wit , the mendelssohn and the tchaikovsky .	532.2752
that is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man	4296.9907
mr . elman is 70 years old .	246.19902
there were 8 , 000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard elman .	714.289
but , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical .	1132.7175
the american part of the evening consisted of paul creston ' s dance overture , william schuman ' s `` chester ' ' from `` new england triptych ' ' and two works of wallingford riegger , dance rhythms , op . 58 , and a romanza for strings , op . 56a .	1037.9254
the creston is purely a potboiler , with spanish , english , french and american dances mixed into the stew .	860.98914
the riegger , with its latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale	974.1642
like his sweet , attractive romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` non-dissonant ( mostly ) ' ' category of works .	1018.8407
the schuman `` chester ' ' takes off from an old william billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect .	3229.5103
all these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors .	1107.5846
it was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change .	533.84503
we have alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the stadium symphony .	430.0543
a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of `` a question of adultery ' ' , yesterday ' s new british import at the apollo .	687.2101
since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise , the film ' s extensive discussion of the problem seems , at best , superfluous .	379.71454
in its present artless , low-budget form , the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath .	2621.5237
with julie london enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive .	2441.3066
the explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident .	806.1181
anthony steel , as the husband , is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce , labeling her action adulterous .	2666.4507
the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of don chaffey , as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father and anton diffring as an innocent bystander .	7855.6206
after a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one ' s surprise , leaves the legal question unresolved .	916.0454
when the husband drops the case and returns to his wife , both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place .	292.60608
-- for its final change of bill in its london season , the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a `` gala program ' ' at the royal opera house , covent garden .	1150.8301
no doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far , it too could give a circus if it pleased .	928.4009
and please it did , in every sense of the word , for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of london audiences .	243.4687
at the end of the program , indeed , there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it .	262.42514
alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number , `` taras bulba ' ' , but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all .	311.16998
only a plea from the house manager , john collins , finally broke up the party .	320.5807
but for all the manifest intention to `` show off ' ' , this was a circus with a difference , for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level , it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company .	334.1824
the `` taras bulba ' ' excerpt is a rousing version of gogol ' s ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by bo fenster to music of soloviev-sedoi .	1216.6083
it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt to make the human body perform .	984.9778
yuri soloviev , oleg sokolov , alexei zhitkov , lev sokolov , yuri korneyev and mr . livshitz were the chief soloists , but everybody on stage was magnificent .	464.29852
at the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus ballet `` bayaderka ' ' , which opened the evening .	623.66095
what a man this petipa was ! !	3339.2852
and why do we in the west know so few of his ballets ? ?	593.989
this scene is a `` white ballet ' ' in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love ' s spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful `` shadows ' ' who can all dance like nothing human -- which , of course , is altogether fitting .	943.3624
the ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty , as well as loveliness , and adagio is the general medium of the piece .	692.3998
its ballerina , olga moiseyeva , performs simple miracles of beauty , and ludmilla alexeyeva , inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments .	5752.5044
sergei vikulov , as the lone male , meets the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is designed to belong to the ladies .	495.95502
the middle section of the program was made up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all of them pretty good at that .	420.79782
they consisted of a new arrangement of `` nutcracker ' ' excerpts danced stunningly by irina kolpakova and mr . sokolev , with a large ensemble	1418.4126
a winning little `` snow maiden ' ' variation by the adorable galina kekisheva	11766.947
two of those poetic adagios in greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by alla osipenko and igor chernishev in one case and inna zubkovskaya and yuri kornevey in the other	5752.4717
an amusing character pas de cinq called `` gossiping women ' '	132.83423
a stirring `` flames of paris ' ' pas de deux by xenia ter-stepanova and alexandre pavlovsky , and a lovely version of fokine ' s `` le cygne ' ' by olga moiseyeva , which had to be repeated .	821.14136
it was quite an evening ! !	210.21509
a year ago today , when the democrats were fretting and frolicking in los angeles and john f . kennedy was still only an able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the presidency , theodore h . white had already compiled masses of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960 .	620.6279
as the pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated , mr . white took more notes .	763.34937
he traveled alternately with mr . kennedy and with richard m . nixon .	147.19426
he asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates ' `` in-groups ' ' .	212.6622
he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in general , as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest presidential election in american history .	346.31613
those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election	392.63556
how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by mr . white in `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' .	160.65855
this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one .	646.7594
what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history .	4307.8926
mr . white , who is only a competent novelist , is a brilliant reporter .	453.2957
his zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book .	886.55786
as a dramatic narrative `` the making of the president 1960 ' ' is continuously engrossing .	293.70663
and as an introduction to american politics it is highly educational .	621.46246
the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr . kennedy , his family and his entourage waiting for the returns .	297.8747
he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential hopefuls five democrats -- senator hubert h . humphrey , senator stuart symington , senator lyndon b . johnson , adlai e . stevenson and mr . kennedy -- and two republicans -- governor rockefeller and mr . nixon .	634.439
then , in chronological order , mr . white covers the primary campaigns , the conventions and the presidential campaign itself .	231.17165
in the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television .	994.3669
mr . white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions .	841.05524
he frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse ' s mouth , from numerous insiders and from mr . kennedy himself	351.36462
but never from mr . nixon , who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust .	216.23549
`` rarely in american history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less ' ' , says mr . white .	393.36697
mr . nixon , he believes , has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign .	770.7442
although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , mr . nixon , mr . white believes , ignored his own top-level planners , wasted time and effort in the wrong regions , missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television .	768.45355
mr . nixon is `` a broody , moody man , given to long stretches of introspection	3264.0374
he trusts only himself and his wife .	225.2627
he is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses .	2956.281
he was above all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked .	729.84143
he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them	228.50534
the least inspiring candidate since alfred m . landon ' ' .	179.01164
mr . kennedy , mr . white believes , `` had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other american could match him ' ' .	293.78873
calm , dignified , composed , `` superbly eloquent ' ' , mr . kennedy always knew everything about everybody .	245.83125
he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers .	846.0901
every decision was made quickly on sound grounds .	768.1484
efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance .	975.8016
mr . kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters .	783.4832
mr . white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a democrat himself who expects mr . kennedy to be a fine president .	315.15005
throughout `` the making of a president ' ' mr . white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down , how subordinates play key roles .	1095.755
and he makes many interesting comments .	976.87885
`` the root question in american politics is always who ' s the man to see ? ?	158.47865
to understand american politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes , who are straw men , who controls , who does not .	253.00327
but to operate in american politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection ' ' .	434.13028
`` in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion ' ' .	845.4488
`` all platforms are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it ' ' .	309.69638
nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old mischa elman on tuesday night , continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of french operatic excerpts .	1570.6299
miss pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments .	728.28235
the better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing .	1078.4893
no orchestra , however , could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as miss pons encountered last night .	605.03094
in all fairness , there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism .	940.7005
one such moment came in the breathtaking way miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeer ' s `` shadow song ' ' .	1003.1598
the years suddenly fell away at this point .	115.647026
on the whole , however , one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on .	1300.8281
sharing the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion .	2538.2742
mr . verreau began shakily , with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume .	3127.278
later on this problem vanished , and the `` flower song ' ' from bizet ' s `` carmen ' ' was beautifully and intelligently projected .	509.8325
radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener .	1752.0513
lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible .	970.1831
the mushrooming of fm outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity .	487.5301
not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners -- an audience which , in the united states , comprises some 19 , 000 , 000 people with $20 , 000 , 000 , 000 to spend each year .	459.6503
of course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching .	1867.2255
he even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials .	849.57336
but the growing number of negro-appeal radio stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects .	1336.4811
it is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3 , 400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the negro .	455.89563
at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states .	619.68256
these and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers .	587.6991
for 10 years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio .	461.73547
in the past 10 years , sponsor observes , these trends have become apparent	555.85956
negro population in the u . s . has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent .	151.82819
`` the forgotten 15 million ' ' -- as sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million .	758.09076
advertisers are changing their attitudes , both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it .	168.47368
stations programing to negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels .	626.8389
futhermore , the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air .	711.7007
in the last decade the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent , and the number of negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent , according to a research man quoted by sponsor .	394.33884
a year ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business .	1031.1877
the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth .	308.52957
it also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the u . s . negroes live outside the southeastern states .	445.11295
also , the state with the largest number of negroes is new york -- not in the south at all .	174.72282
in new york city , wlib boasts `` more community service programs than any other negro station ' ' and `` one of the largest negro news staffs in america ' ' .	474.295
and wwrl ' s colorful mobile unit , cruising predominately negro neighborhoods , is a frequent reminder of that station ' s round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests .	2316.058
recently , wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit .	1613.476
a half-dozen other stations in the new york area also bid for attention of the city ' s negro population , up about 50 per cent in the past decade .	236.67473
in all big cities outside the south , and even in small towns within the south , radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners .	366.43616
the keystone broadcasting system ' s negro network includes 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more than half the total u . s . negro population .	618.3342
one question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the negro is moving into a fully integrated status .	615.0211
whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal .	478.9972
advertisers have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests .	1548.4169
and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , working only from a fact sheet .	909.55316
what sets negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ? ?	451.17273
sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular negro bands and singers	2185.2104
`` race ' ' music , folk songs and melodies , and gospel programs .	1367.4775
furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station .	2970.8418
advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro concern .	1054.0687
sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendon-ebony station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious of quality and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race	681.14465
he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio programs famous ' ' .	1585.0928
the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of j . walter carroll of ksan , san francisco	8574.828
`` negro-appeal radio is more important to the negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires .	385.15735
it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the negro , seeking to become urbanized , as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life .	312.62552
negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation ' ' .	146.02174
presentation of `` the life and times of john sloan ' ' in the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art .	418.9972
staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate sloan collection by the artist ' s widow , helen farr sloan , to the wilmington society of the fine arts , the exhibition presents a survey of sloan ' s work .	463.19107
from early family portraits , painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts , the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate .	433.763
few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived .	207.92427
few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness .	735.7916
the paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of america in the first half of the present century .	272.38275
obviously sloan ' s early years were influenced by his close friend robert henri .	1843.5314
as early as 1928 , however , the sloan style began to change .	159.7664
the dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette .	1110.6552
the solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes .	1754.6423
the exhibition presents all phases of sloan ' s many-sided art .	268.20795
in addition to the paintings are drawings , prints , and illustrations .	642.9885
sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of new york , thereby building for america an incomparable city survey from paintings of mcsorley ' s saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs .	2624.677
one of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is `` sun and wind on the roof ' ' , with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds .	911.0003
although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of `` gloucester harbor ' ' in 1915 ) , the human element was the compelling factor in sloan ' s art .	299.3911
significant are such canvases as `` bleeker street , saturday night ' ' , with its typically american crowd ( sloan never went abroad )	751.10846
the multifigure `` traveling carnival ' ' , in which action is vivified by lighting	690.8047
or `` carmine theater , 1912 ' ' , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although sloan was a member of the famous `` eight ' ' , and of the so-called `` ash-can school ' ' , a term he resented .	368.5943
not all the paintings , however , are of cities .	65.32394
the exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the southwest ( `` koshare in the dust ' ' , a vigorous indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ) .	394.61194
the fact that sloan was an extrovert , concerned primarily with what he saw , adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle .	549.3896
there are 151 items in the wilmington show , including one painting by each member of the `` eight ' ' , as well as work by sloan ' s friends and students .	156.46773
supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence , diaries , books from the artist ' s library , etc . .	387.3428
all belong to the collection being given to wilmington over a period of years by mrs . sloan , who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at the art students league , new york , in the 1920 ' s .	480.35925
to enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries , the delaware art center ( according to its director , bruce st . john ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all sloan works , as well as a card index file .	822.8138
the entire sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians .	252.02328
the current exhibition , which remains on view through oct . 29 , has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources .	605.62555
any musician playing beethoven here , where beethoven was born , is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care .	779.76404
in a sense , he is offering bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer ' s mature style .	421.81635
robert riefling , who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd beethoven festival , penetrated deep into the spirit of the style .	964.4884
his readings were careful without being fussy , and they were authoritative without being presumptuous .	1077.6477
the 32 c minor variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another , leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline .	2607.128
the d minor sonata , op . 31 no . 2 , introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios , was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come .	794.3643
these inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of `` opera style ' ' of which beethoven was genuinely capable , but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging .	514.1758
two late sonatas , op . 110 and 111 , were played with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the op . 111 adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious .	2843.9521
the two were separated from each other by the six bagatelles of op . 126 .	1073.6643
herr riefling , in everything he gave his large beethoven hall audience , proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority .	1550.0591
volker wangenheim , who conducted bonn ' s stadtisches orchester on the following evening , made one more conscious of the process of interpretation .	629.14734
herr wangenheim has only recently become the city ' s music director , and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium .	389.0964
but he weighted the eighth symphony , at times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music .	1166.1804
he might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the choral fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the ninth	420.63892
but no amount of head-tossing could make it so .	2005.192
the conductor ' s preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring .	633.2213
the concerto ' s soloist , hans richter-haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by herr riefling .	892.9119
his was a burgomaster ' s beethoven , solid and sensible .	316.18835
everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano , chorus , and orchestra in c minor , made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs .	636.6895
the entrance of the stadtisches gesangverein ( bonn ' s civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting , however , as the young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life .	1022.0297
the last program of this festival , which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories , brought the cologne rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester and rundfunkchor to bonn ' s gold-filled hall for a performance of the missa solemnis .	4199.401
a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise .	908.2958
but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science .	479.5077
it is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors .	1026.7429
these keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge .	644.4272
in the autumn of 1959 , the british broadcasting corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology .	1967.347
three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator .	681.4637
the participants were professor h . bondi , professor of mathematics at king ' s college , london	424.0043
dr . w . b . bonnor , reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college , london	1138.4606
dr . r . a . lyttleton , a lecturer at st . john ' s college , cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge	209.08472
and dr . g . j . whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology , london .	612.515
the programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , `` rival theories of cosmology ' ' .	597.71075
dr . bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity .	276.9125
first of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds .	502.2656
because of this dr . bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there .	1513.9116
this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years .	837.69714
dr . bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts , that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in .	833.9341
then , after many more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow down and reverse itself again .	820.54565
professor bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory .	1927.8163
he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space .	810.85376
for this reason , he says , the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions .	498.8355
new galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies .	1042.4514
if this is true , then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even though the universe is expanding .	333.5049
for new galaxies to be created , professor bondi declares , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years .	522.9288
he contends this idea doesn ' t conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments .	368.56708
dr . lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons .	522.58875
protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter .	683.0659
the charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite , but dr . lyttleton is not so sure .	638.92975
suppose , says dr . lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ) .	887.661
this would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess .	2603.4817
now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere .	262.94595
because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere .	945.5525
dr . lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it .	1359.2571
this , he claims , would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe .	153.16672
this slim book , while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe , has the appeal that informed conversation always has .	589.60266
several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field .	750.81525
it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science .	1158.9185
presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth ' s atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation .	2259.6016
these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth ' s gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories .	1574.9233
there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us , giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions .	685.91003
in doing away with the tea tray , the elephants and the giant tortoise , science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos .	821.7301
and although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man .	868.3356
`` roots ' ' , the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th st . which has been made over from a night club , is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl .	526.24835
highly successful in england before its transfer to new york , most of `` roots ' ' is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy .	546.43445
only in its final scene , where beatie bryant ( mary doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts .	1967.5476
the burden of mr . wesker ' s message is that people living close to the soil ( at least in england ) are not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine .	834.0116
rather they are genuine clods , proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought .	4971.389
they care no more for politics , says mr . wesker , than they do for a symphony .	195.28459
seeming to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life .	170.37305
they dwell , in short , in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived .	905.6892
but this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as mr . wesker dedicates to it .	412.8092
so much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace , perhaps , and wants a real big heap of contrast ) .	564.14264
the messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there is such a thing as redundancy .	394.0167
miss doyle as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile .	402.01947
she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating , including a dose of good british socialism .	641.0993
but while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her , ronnie has not been able to observe her progress , and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull , he sends beatie a letter of dismissal .	510.47736
beatie , getting no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom .	781.8841
despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why british audiences apparently were impressed by `` roots ' ' .	790.80347
there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play , including william hansen ' s impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and katherine squire ' s vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin ' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else .	1105.29
but i am afraid mr . wesker ' s meat and potatoes dish isn ' t well seasoned enough for local audiences .	412.3162
shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted wednesday night ' s `` much ado about nothing ' ' opening the season of free theatre in central park .	442.9337
the new york shakespeare festival , which is using the wollman memorial skating rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed , began bravely .	3323.1782
joseph papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of `` much ado ' ' , had a vibrant , colorful production under way .	288.61234
using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with shakespeare ' s words in a spirited mixture .	1600.7639
the audience filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence .	3063.4617
the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick , so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult , raised chuckles .	3059.1438
the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges , also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers ' heads , evoked laughter .	3407.7908
the vivacity of the masquers ' party at leonato ' s palace , with the spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon , cast a spell of delight .	760.33673
as `` much ado ' ' turned serious while the insipid claudio rejected hero at the altar , a sprinkle began to fall .	1529.7411
at first hardly a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened .	632.16113
but the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart .	593.3405
the grieving hero and her father , leonato , followed by the friar , left the stage .	827.057
a voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes .	1423.3613
more than half the audience departed .	7325.7715
some remained in the wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads .	2298.9915
others huddled under the trees outside the fence .	399.59415
twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped .	262.61954
beatrice ( nan martin ) and benedick ( j . d . cannon ) took their places on the stage .	264.4985
in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare , like a nostradamus , had foreseen this moment .	752.41156
said benedick `` lady beatrice , have you wept all this while ' ' ? ?	493.47388
replied beatrice `` yea , and i will weep a while longer ' ' .	113.664604
the heavens refused to give up their weeping .	851.9449
the gallant company completed act 4 , and got through part of act 5 .	993.1836
but the final scenes could not be played .	138.6651
if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out , let them take comfort .	947.31433
`` much ado ' ' ends happily .	728.4313
the parks department has done an admirable job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare .	1468.0284
one could hardly blame newbold morris , the parks commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department ' s technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains .	880.0412
eldon elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and shakespeare ' s lighthearted mood .	1729.0247
mr . papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace , although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable .	1799.4637
elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints .	861.28973
still a demurrer or two must be entered .	305.57047
schwarzkopf is , of course , schwarzkopf .	253.19083
for style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her .	466.36874
if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible .	408.33087
put to the service of lieder of schubert , brahms , strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision .	1142.0137
but what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism .	2821.893
instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside .	1218.0444
the symptoms saturday night were unmistakable .	668.1185
clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic .	6658.382
there was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect .	395.42377
the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness .	512.5594
there were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication .	766.74133
miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , john wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition .	1666.9562
all the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills	292.9402
miss schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .	400.69354
the dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8 , 500 of them ) had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when stadium concerts presented the first of two dance programs .	826.2107
on saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved .	710.8291
there was , additionally , a bonus for the saturday-night patrons .	2192.9243
alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first new york performance of mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival .	249.25487
otherwise , the program included , as on thursday , the taras-tchaikovsky `` design for strings ' ' , the dollar-britten `` divertimento ' ' , the dollar-de banfield `` the duel ' ' and the pas de deux from `` the nutcracker ' ' .	327.81238
maria tallchief and erik bruhn , who danced the `` nutcracker ' ' pas de deux , were also seen in the petipa-minkus pas de deux from `` don quixote ' ' , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely .	866.1314
among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening , elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` the duel ' ' , a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants .	770.0007
mr . ailey ' s `` roots of the blues ' ' , an earthy and very human modern dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening .	273.8075
as brother john sellers sang five `` blues ' ' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep shepard , mr . ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic .	1637.7338
their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan .	1004.74866
he wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress .	879.8591
the cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions .	1832.062
`` roots of the blues ' ' may not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact .	948.7207
`` perhaps it is better to stay at home .	179.00542
the armchair traveler preserves his illusions ' ' .	77.98599
this somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' , a collection of travel essays by william sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .	429.6839
mr . sansom is english , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between .	3194.806
the only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell , mr . sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an american multimillionaire ( his fourth ) .	1119.3672
the result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices .	2431.8596
there are sixteen essays in `` blue skies , brown studies ' ' .	193.00854
most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines .	625.8181
all are well written and are overwritten .	1545.4628
but , even if mr . sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound .	1510.3331
too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another .	1506.9686
mr . sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of english , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references .	1136.1107
`` i like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks like , its color , its particular kind of life ' ' .	391.21616
this is an exact description of what mr . sansom does .	179.17279
he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions .	1684.7617
it is an over-all impression mr . sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past .	928.9518
william sansom writes only about europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london , vienna , the french riviera and the norwegian fjords .	817.3864
but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .	462.96277
`` a writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment ' ' , he says .	93.22755
`` beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all .	353.5886
to transmit that feeling he writes ' ' .	35.481873
this may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of mr . sansom .	122.00434
so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st . torpetius that still persists in st . tropez	684.19055
at the sun and the heat of mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an englishman than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas city	1673.5691
at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world ' s finest restaurants , la bonne auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the nice airport	431.00726
and at the infinite variety of london .	426.6091
mr . sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of bernini and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto .	1013.7866
he can coin a neat phrase `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people ' '	1665.5435
tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel ' s ears ' '	1202.4487
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity ' ' .	752.7761
and , for all his lacquered , almost byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison .	1916.8231
in one of his best essays mr . sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio himself that dot the environs of vicenza .	1566.6213
how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence mr . sansom reminds us thus	3493.4353
`` the white colonnaded , cedar-roofed southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied england to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue south , the palladian orbit stretching out from vicenza the old mind of andrea palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips ' ' .	2470.3113
nice , even if a trifle gaudy .	3464.818
`` blue skies , brown studies ' ' is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs .	498.01984
in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio .	581.4379
wbai , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void .	896.9065
yesterday it offered `` poised for violence ' ' , by jean reavey .	337.63235
wbai is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue to demonstrate .	816.10706
unfortunately , `` poised for violence ' ' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point .	154.78499
mrs . reavey ' s work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-broadway production in the fall -- and , in addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged .	404.85312
the play ' s device is to explore society ' s obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist ' s models who remain part of someone else ' s painting rather than just be themselves .	631.045
in a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty .	1749.7853
somewhere in mrs . reavey ' s play there is both protest and aspiration of merit .	490.48563
but its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener ' s stamina begins to wilt .	1109.2029
moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind ' s ills .	1541.3068
but quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author ' s words .	292.34656
which in itself is an immediate reward of the wbai experiment	1865.2009
good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration .	3302.0247
a weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month .	2192.3118
titled `` what ' s new in music ' ' ? ?	53.300728
the enterprising program is heard saturday afternoons on radio station aj .	1760.5524
the brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze .	1433.774
the show is programed and written by the station ' s assistant continuity editor , chuck briefer .	1012.2057
the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings .	567.10596
last saturday ' s interesting melange included ernst toch , karlheinz stockhausen , richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space ' ' opera by the swedish composer , karl-birger blomdahl .	1880.3033
other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country .	250.89594
it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene .	819.3281
but one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions .	438.46252
the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long american tour to a close .	610.6271
it is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody ' s heart .	413.68646
it is good to see those numbers again .	638.7631
the `` suite of old russian dances ' ' that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical moiseyev vigor and warmth	1467.955
the amusing `` yurochka ' ' , in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance	405.61096
the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) `` polyanka ' ' or `` the meadow ' '	613.3705
the three moldavian dances entitled `` zhok ' '	1280.1001
the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` bul ' ba ' '	4007.0352
and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` city quadrille ' ' are all just as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back .	306.82114
so , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the `` kalmuk dance ' ' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called `` the platter ' ' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` summer ' ' , `` the three shepherds ' ' of azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant `` rock ' n ' roll ' ' .	701.9393
as autumn starts its annual sweep , few americans and canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world ' s finest fall coloring .	994.61115
spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth .	332.55035
the only other regions so blessed are the british isles , western europe , eastern china , southern chile and parts of japan , new zealand and tasmania .	1504.8215
their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame up in north america .	2921.2947
jack frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle	2421.389
in fact , a freezing autumn dulls the blaze .	16312.096
the best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , followed by sunny days and cool nights .	1671.7194
foliage pilgrimages , either organized or individual , are becoming an autumn item for more and more americans each year .	750.6892
below is a specific guide , keyed to the calendar .	637.91724
late september finds quebec ' s color at its peak , especially in the laurentian hills and in the area south of the st . lawrence river .	253.35228
in the maritime provinces farther east , the tones are a little quieter .	1045.3948
ontario ' s foliage is most vivid from about sept . 23 to oct . 10 , with both muskoka ( 100 miles north of toronto ) and haliburton ( 125 miles northwest of toronto ) holding color cavalcades starting sept . 23 .	1178.6045
in the canadian rockies , great groves of aspen are already glinting gold .	10255.555
vermont ' s sugar maples are scarlet from sept . 25 to oct . 15 , and often hit a height in early october .	465.87268
new hampshire figures its peak around columbus day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches .	2218.5654
the shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of maine .	1034.2172
in western massachusetts and northwest connecticut , the berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of october .	682.5742
the adirondacks blaze brightest in early october , choice routes being 9n from saratoga up to lake george and 73 and 86 in the lake placid area .	3158.5852

a year ago it was bruited that the primary character in erich maria remarque ' s new novel was based on the marquis alfonso de portago , the spanish nobleman who died driving in the mille miglia automobile race of 1957 .	2263.159
if this was in fact mr . remarque ' s intention he has achieved a notable failure .	191.5058
clerfayt of `` heaven has no favorites ' ' resembles portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas portago was a good one .	889.6683
he is a dull , unformed , and aimless person	3766.1604
the twelfth marquis de portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate .	897.5769
one looked forward to mr . remarque ' s ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised .	912.8958
unhappily , `` heaven has no favorites ' ' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list .	447.4837
mr . remarque ' s conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble .	344.0221
he proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery .	904.1108
his treatment of it is something else .	224.52803
his heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay .	710.96124
her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen .	283.2053
between the first meeting of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement , mr . remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of europe , and a modicum of automobile racing .	1480.7422
the ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of it all are distressing	208.95166
the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming	1206.1016
the automobile racing bears little relation to reality .	475.702
this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer .	875.9839
hazards to life and limb on the golf course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant .	2538.7412
race-drivers , on the other hand , are quite often killed on the circuit , and since it was obviously mr . remarque ' s intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes .	672.1505
the jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature .	279.90918
perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal .	436.52283
the book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing .	913.8457
the necessity is not clear to me , and , in any case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car , which , or whom , he calls `` giuseppe ' ' , parked `` on the place vendome sneering at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces parked around him ' ' is not a liberty	753.6554
but it is in the matter of preoccupation with death , which is the primary concern of the book , that remarque ' s failure is plainest .	409.76703
clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive .	775.4798
to be human , he believes , is to seek one ' s own destruction the freudian `` death-wish ' ' cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers .	2202.5854
in point of fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live .	478.0824
a clerfayt may moon on about the face of death in the cockpit	132.42334
a portago could say , as he did say to me , `` if i die tomorrow , still i have had twenty-eight wonderful years	809.0104
but i shan ' t die tomorrow	598.0825
i ' ll live to be 105 ' ' .	81.40832
clerfayt , transported , may think of the engine driving his car as `` a mystical beast under the hood ' ' .	472.2051
the italian master piero taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car ' s adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae .	2638.1506
clerfayt , driving , sees himself `` a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell ' '	2377.9011
the briton stirling moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of all time , believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet .	1132.1488
errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr . remarque hoped to tell us .	351.48343
however , my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists .	1821.5923
the west is leaderless , according to this book .	72.53288
in contrast , the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev , tito , and mao .	1312.3265
against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all .	586.29956
it is field marshal montgomery ' s belief that in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity	336.35953
about 30 per cent call themselves christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable , and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and believers in democracy .	502.83832
but these western countries do care about themselves .	610.4375
if , say , the russians intended to stop tom jones ' going to the pub , then tom jones would fight the commies .	870.3639
but he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as `` cause ' ' .	349.879
for all practical purposes , the west stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership .	916.55536
with this barrage , montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the west .	3182.2566
never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly america .	1111.7021
at war ' s end leadership in western europe passed from britain because the labour government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state .	704.92755
with britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united states .	385.7762
montgomery believes that she started well .	352.49484
`` america gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike ' ' .	503.11365
she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace .	553.3947
america has divided more than she has united the west .	246.65894
the reasons are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strives to be liked .	542.9013
however , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed .	435.02655
but the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling american leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor .	2343.1648
`` they are determined ' ' , montgomery writes , `` not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the western alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible ' ' .	415.28302
the net result is that under american leadership the general world situation has become bad .	630.77246
to `` monty ' ' , the american people , who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight , `` now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war ' ' .	285.04242
as faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states must be relied upon to lead .	420.77652
the path to leadership is made clear .	207.93677
montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the west ' s own house in order .	187.92027
such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence .	347.8626
this leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the united states , namely that russia will agree to a reunited germany , that the east german government does not exist , that events in japan in june 1960 were communist-inspired , that the true government of china is in formosa , that mao was the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 , and that either china or russia wants or expects war .	658.112
such a leader must strengthen nato politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked .	656.7104
after drastically overhauling nato , western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the east and west .	872.7697
major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970 .	499.26242
`` the west should make the central proposal	444.73892
but the east would have to show sincerity in carrying it out ' ' .	116.68412
`` but where is the leader who will handle all these things for us ' ' ? ?	111.74084
montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy .	379.92374
the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle .	423.04907
he alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision .	148.1736
but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring france ' s lost soul .	341.6274
whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership .	3801.9592
the leader montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to changing situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper .	1755.9915
all in all , montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him .	901.23645
in looking as far back as moses , thence to cromwell , napoleon , lincoln , churchill , and nehru , montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men .	1044.738
he believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by churchill , who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for hitler ' s war .	298.5779
however , montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice .	524.247
most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said , and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene .	272.27747
like eisenhower , he holds the militarist ' s suspicion of politicians .	727.97675
however , at the same time montgomery selects as his hero de gaulle , who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions .	1978.963
`` monty ' ' shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support .	1399.075
for the most part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts .	2116.8174
nevertheless , montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world .	449.27835
it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership .	618.3307
and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events .	406.05197
it is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer `` live ' ' for the first time only after he has died .	457.10986
but then , mario lanza was no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital ' ' only when he has ceased to be a living voice .	735.52014
it is a kind of justice , too , that it should originate in london ' s royal albert hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( rca victor lm 2454 , $4 . 98 ) .	556.15704
to be sure , lanza made numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to new york where the carping critic might lurk .	2015.422
the reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in u . s . life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public .	913.0987
the department of agriculture averaged out u . s . food consumption last year at 1 , 488 lbs . per person , which , allowing for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry every night , means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs . or more a day .	891.22614
that mother hen of the weight-height tables , the metropolitan life insurance co . , clucks that 48 million americans are overweight .	1978.1025
through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough .	2651.9941
for the first time in history , the u . s . has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the government ' s most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce .	428.23163
in this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume .	1708.8173
refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage .	8386.888
and in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american interest in how what people eat affects their health .	953.62585
to eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine .	290.9127
not all the concern for health is well directed .	605.6383
from the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the u . s . has progressed to curds , concentrates and capsules .	415.9703
each year , reports the american medical association , ten million americans spend $900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements .	1819.3379
at juice bars in los angeles ' 35 `` health ' ' stores , a new sensation is a pink , high-protein cocktail , concocted of dried eggs , powdered milk and cherry-flavored no-cal , which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz . glass .	2115.1094
grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all .	648.6731
but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of u . s . scientists wants to supply them .	238.25986
the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university of minnesota ' s physiologist ancel keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime k ( for keys ) ration and author of last year ' s bestselling eat well and stay well .	1534.593
from his birch-paneled office in the laboratory of physiological hygiene , under the university ' s football stadium in minneapolis ( `` we get a rumble on every touchdown ' ' ) , blocky , grey-haired dr . keys directs an ambitious , $200 , 000-a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing .	1089.3949
pursuing it , he has logged 500 , 000 miles , suffered indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10 , 000 individuals , from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini .	2346.4263
he has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of finnish woodcutters , analyzed the `` mealie-meal ' ' eaten by capetown coloreds , and experimented on minneapolis businessmen .	6354.1147
keys ' s findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many an eating cliche .	990.41376
vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on ( though mothers ' milk is still the ticket ) .	1338.4818
readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack .	504.8793
already many an american knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) .	1856.8744
out of cholesterol come keys ' s main messages so far	1581.1116
the typical u . s . daily menu , says dr . keys , contains 3 , 000 calories , should contain 2 , 300 .	272.05255
and extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart attack .	592.8818
with meat , milk , butter and ice cream , the calorie-heavy u . s . diet is 40% fat , and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind , says dr . keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease .	747.00024
throughout much of the world , food is still so scarce that half of the earth ' s population has trouble getting the 1 , 600 calories a day necessary to sustain life .	528.78284
the deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant .	14424.687
in west africa , for example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or `` red johnny ' ' , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease .	1759.522
in the well-fed u . s . , deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years .	741.4455
today , as harrison ' s principles of internal medicine , a standard internist ' s text , puts it , `` the most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity ' ' .	477.60187
puritan new england regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin .	1092.3516
says keys `` maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think ' ' .	304.74033
morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him .	560.8243
the simple mechanical strain of overweight , says new york ' s dr . norman jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built ' ' .	391.98532
the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums .	1491.6558
he has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25% higher death rate from cancer .	2331.5881
he is particularly vulnerable to diabetes .	732.5607
he may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement .	19372.996
physiologically , people overeat because what dr . jolliffe calls the `` appestat ' ' is set too high .	333.6471
the appestat , which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant , is located , says jolliffe , in the hypothalamus -- near the body ' s temperature , sleep and water-balance controls .	758.847
in moderate doses , alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail )	4508.317
but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz . -- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry .	1824.2417
in rare cases , diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroying nearly all sense of satiety .	4152.349
far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .	974.49634
it may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother ' s nagging .	425.8995
some families place undue emphasis on food conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .	2026.7565
the result says jolliffe `` the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life ' ' .	168.38133
food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .	955.4711
reports dr . keys `` a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .	445.64474
he may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .	237.25099
so she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .	1802.1757
it ' s a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she ' s being deprived of something else ' ' .	236.1566
for the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won .	2480.791
physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( benzedrine , dexedrine ) as dangerous `` crutches for a weak will ' ' .	982.1596
keys has no such objections to metrecal , quaker oats ' s quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters .	4226.7266
`` metrecal is a pretty complete food ' ' , he says .	126.970894
`` it contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals .	583.7178
in the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose weight on it -- 20 , 30 or 40 lbs . ' ' .	434.01624
but keys worries that the metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food .	1425.4105
despite his personal distaste for obesity ( `` disgusting ' ' ) , dr . keys has only an incidental interest in how much americans eat .	640.03485
what concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation ' s no . 1 killer coronary artery disease , which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500 , 000 americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents .	713.77625
cholesterol , the cornerstone of dr . keys ' s theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol .	1470.7239
scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells , since it accounts for about 2% of the brain ' s total solid weight .	1715.9996
they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .	3051.8093
they suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system .	436.8054
but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver .	440.61078
although the fatty protein molecules , carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol , are water soluble , cholesterol itself is insoluble , and cannot be destroyed by the body .	640.95746
`` a remarkable substance ' ' , says dr . keys , `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries ' ' .	153.87057
when thus deposited , keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks .	3620.7793
explains keys as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery .	792.0141
the proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind .	434.24457
as cholesterol piles up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation .	1861.1232
eventually , says keys , one of two things happens .	322.2059
a clot forms at the site , seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack .	463.62775
or ( more commonly , thinks keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery ' s flow to the point that an infarct occurs the heart muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured .	1424.782
ordinarily , the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body ' s needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile .	969.79175
even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says dr . keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood .	1060.8026
during world war 2 , , doctors in the netherlands and scandinavia noted a curious fact despite the stresses of nazi occupation , the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping .	1609.1364
not until long after the war -- 1950 , in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason .	254.67506
that year , sweden ' s haqvin malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods .	5027.6357
that same year the university of california ' s dr . laurance kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise .	2031.4315
here keys and others , such as dr . a . e . ahrens of the rockefeller institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each .	446.23398
all natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated .	1217.0651
the degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule .	330.05103
saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens .	1412.2308
mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens .	2425.3052
the three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz . ) , but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol .	2027.9647
as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .	236.78952
just what is meant by `` spirit ' ' and by `` matter ' ' ? ?	64.84198
the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all .	647.1827
yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do .	405.33313
for in the modern world neither `` spirit ' ' nor `` matter ' ' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience .	577.7333
we are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .	580.6516
when the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .	1671.1288
one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit .	549.4035
just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .	672.206
not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .	340.96487
demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .	497.03717
in such a world the words `` matter ' ' and `` spirit ' ' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .	345.6579
in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .	359.18042
the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it .	940.92163
in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit .	2008.4628
the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .	553.38574
science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .	323.962
when , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .	784.47766
in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions .	8070.407
there have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .	277.4318
all this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .	1090.8073
the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .	476.88226
the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .	510.34717
although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .	757.40424
we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience .	214.15247
there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .	255.16725
science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .	801.24646
the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur miller ' s play the crucible , which deals with the salem witch trials .	587.6461
as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century .	264.61014
aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .	427.209
the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .	961.38715
there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .	860.1976
instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .	470.00208
a teenage girl , abigail williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the reverend samuel parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .	2148.9604
for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .	539.9934
as the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .	941.41626
everyone in salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it .	1876.9816
it is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with abigail and parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .	4290.4595
it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .	750.00116
the audience leaves the play under a spell , it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes .	622.5649
if one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit ' ' .	165.86404
this is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience .	571.73315
in the end the good man , john proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` a fire , a fire is burning ! !	302.53568
i hear the boot of lucifer , i see his filthy face ' ' ! !	216.4454
the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them .	607.3396
we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .	755.877
yet are not we of the mid-twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing ' ' as the devil , just as bad off as they -- only in a different way ? ?	261.54605
in our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .	342.92017
we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false .	462.0515
even mr . miller himself seems uncertain on this score .	404.0019
in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point `` however , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer ' s many-faced lieutenants .	384.828
and his belief is not to his discredit .	629.4744
better minds than hale ' s were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken ' ' .	208.31865
( page 33 ) on the other hand , a little later on he says `` since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god ' s beard and the devil ' s horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes .	1006.39856
the concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .	414.69867
when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man ' s worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state ' ' .	545.58777
apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real .	574.1389
yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem .	309.77612
it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power .	260.0107
it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .	560.5454
for this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .	1861.2296
the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author ' s convictions to the contrary .	133.47527
there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .	685.0481
apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence .	462.52588
think , for example , of the spirit of the marine corps .	91.11089
surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .	1252.4708
we cannot , of course , assign it any substance .	598.2953
it is not material and is not a `` thing ' ' occupying space and time .	147.53815
yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .	344.86188
so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan .	1299.409
every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .	144.02486
in searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .	301.72775
for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .	224.11278
it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .	469.38635
it is the spirit which is the source of a community ' s drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers .	324.57278
yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .	275.67947
the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas .	575.7971
one characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .	1446.318
the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .	571.69037
it is for them a given which they and they alone possess .	2704.0088
the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it .	487.60263
it is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it .	261.2418
if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people ' ' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .	207.53964
this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .	1375.5623
the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents bultmann ' s intention .	4909.953
his point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma .	698.2108
when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding of existence .	374.5933
mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols ' ' or `` ciphers ' ' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .	346.66144
the statement is often made that when bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith ' ' .	709.7517
but this statement is completely unconvincing .	2373.6052
if bultmann ' s own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .	608.30853
nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .	623.48706
on the contrary , even in the heart of `` the bible belt ' ' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man ' s picture of himself and his world .	224.15694
in fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of bultmann ' s argument is disclosed .	302.70682
although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .	271.52042
this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .	428.42667
time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist ' ' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .	694.6767
the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-protestantism ' ' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american churches .	525.71387
in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion ' ' current in the situation .	378.30832
this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peale ' s `` cult of reassurance ' ' or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .	583.6051
but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .	567.4454
however , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .	588.23596
to be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock ' ' and `` the great crowd ' ' and to take solace from paul ' s castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise ' ' in the opening chapter of first corinthians .	321.02185
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?	2340.1667
can the church risk assuming that the `` folly ' ' of men is as dear to god as their `` wisdom ' ' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of god ' ' and `` the foolishness of men ' ' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?	304.71286
can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?	2376.2383
there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the greeks rather than from the bible ) that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .	302.80817
by analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world ' ' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .	145.49554
but , as scripture everywhere reminds us , god does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by god ' s providence , presents it .	388.40088
and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .	393.228
until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .	702.8033
in arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved	583.2401
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .	828.1924
but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .	510.13596
this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .	262.6898
if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no , or where i do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian .	361.57434
expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .	1024.3844
this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .	350.39023
modern man , as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age ' '	659.71155
and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward	447.45892
and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .	609.2148
in any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us .	232.35625
to say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .	231.48184
we have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal ' ' tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of schleiermacher , ritschl , herrmann , harnack , and troeltsch , and more recently , schweitzer and the early barth and , in part at least , bultmann .	756.2573
it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong .	338.30307
for we must number here not only the names of bushnell , clarke , and rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the chicago school ' ' and macintosh , but those of the brothers niebuhr and ( if america may claim him ! !	673.8096
finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal ' ' movement that developed at the university of chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of alfred north whitehead .	1061.7004
what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .	900.40533
although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity .	818.9403
they have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to god , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .	434.64896
when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .	253.82858
however much we may have to criticize liberal theology ' s constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .	789.4475
in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which bultmann ' s attempt to formulate such a theology has led .	442.6286
for we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .	561.9344
if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right ' ' is clearly untenable .	569.46643
whereas bultmann ' s `` center ' ' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right ' ' , as represented , say , by karl barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .	479.27274
it follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left ' ' , which has been represented on the continent by fritz buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in american and english theology .	273.8118
in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .	246.09396
we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by bultmann , barth , and buri .	940.9885
to do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third ' ' possibility is a meaningless question .	253.36897
thus , if what is at issue is whether `` all s is p ' ' , it is indifferent whether `` some s is not p ' ' or `` no s is p ' ' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .	361.30185
hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted	639.59827
for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .	337.72107
therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of buri and barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of bultmann .	854.64496
a second point requires more extended comment .	734.2096
it will be recalled from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the `` right ' ' , as represented by barth , rests on the following thesis the only tenable alternative to bultmann ' s position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation	688.33264
( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation	3699.348
and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that , from bultmann ' s point of view , are mythological .	635.25214
one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom .	287.05728
representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman and anglican churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the holy office in 1864 .	531.3547
now again in 1961 , in england , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as christian unity .	290.8281
the church unity octave , january 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .	671.6997
many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .	263.59274
but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the catholic side .	487.49963
for the `` tide is well on the turn ' ' , as the london catholic weekly universe has written .	199.16624
i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman .	787.5124
as an american catholic of irish ancestry , i came with certain preconceptions and expectations	2037.6571
being intellectually influenced by newman and the general 19th-century literature of england , i knew only a protestant-dominated country .	869.4235
since arriving here , however , i have formed a far different religious picture of present-day england .	279.39273
in representing part of this new picture , i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments	373.5281
but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england .	756.92114
since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric .	1634.7673
in any case , i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen , even in devonshire and cornwall , where anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .	1507.1023
nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism .	1720.4247
on my first guy fawkes day here , i found catholics as well as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .	991.35254
a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` the true story of guy fawkes ' ' , which began	540.9616
`` when you pile your `` guy ' ' on the bonfire tomorrow night , i wonder how much of the true story of guy fawkes you will remember ? ?	518.0951
in the 355 years since the first guy fawkes night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder ' ' .	272.71637
the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1 .	775.25134
in spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of newman and other tractarians of the 1840 ' s and 1850 ' s , the catholic segment of england one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800 , 000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .	340.3145
the return of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .	1044.7874
in 1864 newman professedly had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers .	780.6524
now , in 1961 , the catholic population of england is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million )	273.98682
yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .	946.7846
a protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham oratory ( catholic ) church on sunday mornings .	852.9973
she found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of english people are churchgoers .	511.36978
she may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .	400.9816
from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services .	2658.654
a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university , following anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated mass before more than a hundred .	582.1637
the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .	525.4818
according to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england , the `` total of confirmed members is 9 , 748 , 000 , but only 2 , 887 , 671 are registered on the parochial church rolls ' ' , and `` over 27 million people in england are baptized into the church of england , but roughly only a tenth of them continue ' ' .	314.51923
an amazing article in the manchester guardian of last november , entitled `` fate of redundant churches ' ' , states than an archbishops ' commission `` reported last month that in the church of england alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years ' time .	837.9664
a further 260 anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 ' ' .	487.4606
and in the last five years , the `` methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels ' ' .	659.9737
most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but `` neither anglicans nor nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics ' ' , and have done so .	971.02997
while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church .	930.9903
it should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) .	668.9939
still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that protestants are decreasing and catholics increasing .	452.05112
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .	1161.7963
a century ago , newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism , and that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own ' ' .	1729.8633
that day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a `` protestant country ' ' .	266.65652
one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real christians to unite .	479.71924
many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .	460.76245
the london universe devoted its centenary issue last december 8 to mapping out various aspects of catholic progress during the last one hundred years .	1665.1782
with traditional nationalistic spirit , some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best .	871.6584
i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics .	938.45276
it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses at mass .	715.4333
they hope , of course , to reclaim the non-catholic population to the catholic faith , and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the `` prayer for england ' '	550.23956
`` o blessed virgin mary , mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon england , thy `` dowry ' ' , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .	754.6569
intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief shepherd , the vicar of thy son .	655.8255
' ' a hymn often to be heard in catholic churches is `` faith of our fathers ' ' , which glories in england ' s ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims `` faith of our fathers mary ' s prayers shall win our country back to thee ' ' .	576.8139
the english saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized .	1178.813
because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , english catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being `` un-english ' ' .	557.85046
i have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air .	297.54648
for example , a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations the only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are ' un-english ' ' ' .	671.086
in this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of irish catholics , priests and laity , in england , while certainly seen as good for catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholics , especially when these irishmen offer to remind their christian brethren of this good .	646.47296
one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities .	769.2982
at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .	746.08575
moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .	363.32547
now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university .	756.74146
some catholic priests lecture there	877.8702
catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students .	1041.9459
further evidence that roman catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of england .	768.26965
the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches .	975.3876
on successive sundays during october , 1960 , paul ferris ( a non-catholic ) wrote articles in the observer depicting clergymen of the church of england , the church of rome and the nonconformist church .	574.1272
the catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .	1578.496
there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman .	565.9549
such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian england .	2056.6335
there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on b . b . c . , where comments were equally made by an anglican parson , a free church minister and a catholic priest .	526.8226
catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen .	1307.2745
a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool , dr . heenan , and the anglican archbishop of york , dr . ramsey , recently appointed archbishop of canterbury .	647.5441
the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england .	631.07635
the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .	760.71826
and it was interesting to observe that b . b . c . ' s television film on christmas eve was the bells of st . mary ' s .	150.67438
of course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr . fisher , then anglican archbishop of canterbury , to the vatican last december .	1283.2427
it was the first time an english primate has done this since the 14th century .	2213.0935
english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope .	831.48975
almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants	1243.2491
news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit	1754.6874
a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters	687.61096
the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the house of lords in the next generation ' '	352.2744
a report that 200 protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave .	2891.042
the death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .	211.84584
the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality .	3669.964
but how can one figure symbolize both ? ?	4457.8164
christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur .	368.78857
perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as irenaeus .	736.12396
to be the savior and the lord , jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own	352.12192
he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man ' s history .	1213.6388
yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .	453.4213
his history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it .	326.44482
his death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus .	468.95105
each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .	383.1263
not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it	578.9701
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .	20331.15
as represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself	415.2551
yet each historical event remains unique .	2270.2612
christ is both unique and universal .	333.5014
the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam .	494.7469
as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ .	190.02809
`` whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ? ?	126.720856
from god ' s will and wisdom , and from virgin earth .	1988.1394
for ' god had not rained ' , says the scripture , before man was made , and there was no man to till the earth .	632.8938
from this earth , then , while it was still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity ' ' .	376.43365
irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .	515.964
adam and eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .	388.84714
they were , in fact , children .	99.3918
irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul	3285.2703
therefore there is no need for him , as there is for origen , to identify existence itself with the fall .	304.2577
existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history .	925.52167
historical existence is a created good .	692.0229
the biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words `` so god created man in his own image	536.15784
in the similitude of god he created him ' ' .	142.3083
there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement `` if the ( holy ) spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature	286.54706
and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image ( of god ) in his formation , but not receiving the similitude ( of god ) through the spirit ' ' .	338.85812
thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster	301.6193
the similitude of god , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature .	235.73819
recent research on irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction .	556.8172
he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall	440.8163
for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .	1701.3121
therefore irenaeus describes man ' s creation as follows	235.28763
`` so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against god his creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards god , a law was given him by god , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .	436.2467
and he laid down for him certain conditions so that , if he kept the command of god , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal	239.7342
but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken ' ' .	379.64722
these conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal	245.05379
yet he did not stop being human as a result .	273.5717
there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god ( humanity ) and the similitude of god ( immortality ) .	752.4542
man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil ' s promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality .	448.10098
he was , in the words of irenaeus , `` beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality ' ' .	201.32321
the true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .	846.47345
for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .	447.5035
and even as she , having indeed a husband , adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race	528.202
so also did mary , having a man betrothed ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race ' ' .	524.0813
because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created as children , irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked ' ' .	898.8764
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary .	833.24365
that parallelism affects his picture of man ' s disobedience too	502.84573
for as it was christ , the word of god , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .	180.60123
with this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .	499.43292
at the nadir of that circuit is death .	445.65094
`` along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience	319.13556
and disobedience to god entails death .	2569.8262
wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it ' ' .	315.32306
this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a friday , as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday	554.24426
he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath .	394.61346
in any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .	640.2631
the wages of sin is death .	82.77308
man ' s life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god , must now be conformed to the shape of death .	361.99612
nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to god , and he still rules .	357.17905
even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function .	946.1925
`` wherefore also he ( god ) drove him ( man ) out of paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because he envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because he pitied him , ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable .	613.966
but he set a bound to his ( state of ) sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to god ' ' .	372.96265
this idea , which occurs in both tatian and cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus ' theology	5558.959
for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ .	228.30592
as man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that christ could bring many to life .	340.9784
it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is .	234.13095
this applies to his picture of adam .	492.55185
it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next .	460.64536
it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality .	279.00238
this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man ' s fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the greek-speaking ones .	2273.8276
they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .	371.58426
death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .	410.14258
it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time .	332.24146
these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .	478.2208
the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated .	622.95276
such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether adam ' s life was intended to be part of the process of time .	357.31824
if it was , then it must have been god ' s intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity .	229.4617
one night , so some of these theories run , adam would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve	1316.9417
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .	458.1988
the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change .	414.61502
on the other hand , christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .	922.97345
it is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .	298.37582
if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator .	365.31946
this seems to have been the conclusion to which origen was forced .	493.97815
if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i . e . , created , existence .	972.3802
such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation	5625.21
for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .	235.3076
because christianity teaches not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ .	199.4311
furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .	1216.5201
the unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the back bay -- and parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .	966.1012
ezra stiles gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .	1443.1333
even so , gannett judiciously argued , the association could legitimately decide that parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness ' ' .	895.9537
we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .	3043.5957
one can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture to the first church , and so to suppress it , rather than let parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .	515.2321
finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as gannett ' s son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians .	279.30362
their demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry ' ' to the extreme of proclaiming christianity a `` natural ' ' religion .	663.11017
grant all this -- still , when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .	3032.3342
whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association , while it may plead that dr . n . l . frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` the difference between trinitarians and unitarians is a difference in christianity	531.32074
the difference between mr . parker and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity ' ' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the association never quite brought itself officially to expel parker .	931.0054
had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parker ' s insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi ' ' .	1168.89
happily for posterity , then , the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .	474.7294
fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol defended parker ' s sincerity , as did also gannett and chandler robbins	2348.4846
whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the fellowship .	390.01404
in the hall , after adjournment , dr . frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears .	1497.3082
all this near tragedy , which to us borders on comedy , enables us to tell the story over and over again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency .	663.97296
it was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of new england ( which we inherit ) did triumph .	1619.38
to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .	2168.441
yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance for its rejection of ralph waldo emerson ' s the divinity school address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .	815.9129
in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .	1510.586
suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?	5193.452
is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?	1289.0277
however , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .	432.18893
emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .	1283.5388
parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the fellowship to throw him out .	479.08398
hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .	567.86255
he still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .	573.8283
actually , the dispute between parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .	222.78912
it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .	1321.2094
the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .	3606.1853
parker , along with garrison and charles sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery .	2467.98
nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace	1663.6736
their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut .	250.03792
but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .	734.4894
even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .	1056.8595
it has been endlessly rephrased , but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ? ?	1937.3346
and then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ? ?	271.5005
there can be no doubt , the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .	984.7402
the gentle channing , revered by all bostonians , orthodox or unitarian , wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action `` no city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .	1105.6991
we stand more in awe of one another than most people .	783.31854
opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron ' ' .	331.6974
even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , channing added -- remember , this is channing , not parker ! !	402.36124
-- that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy ' ' .	586.4989
channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !	96.393196
i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .	515.2879
but theodore parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth congregational church ' ' which bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the unitarian churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum .	1217.2965
because he spoke openly with what channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- parker vindicated channing ' s further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines .	6161.0454
an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license .	2152.1218
by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , i am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest .	299.42194
he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .	256.8846
what otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters ' ' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' holy , holy , holy is the almighty dollar ' `` ? ?	809.9325
nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as parker snarled at them thus `` talk about the catholics voting as the bishop tells ! !	985.61304
reproach the catholics for it ! !	64.55362
you and i do the same thing .	90.79607
there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome , but to the almighty dollar , a pope much nearer home .	596.4267
boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think ' ' .	380.48575
and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them `` even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them ' ' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .	738.48474
it was `` duty ' ' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty .	344.9568
parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .	1326.4011
`` if it gave me pleasure to say hard things ' ' , he wrote , `` i would shut up forever ' ' .	142.0964
we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` but the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , i must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire ' ' .	293.37323
because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people ' s consciences .	596.4074
our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the four gospels .	567.5526
it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven a . m . on the third of august , a . d . 32 .	690.92725
we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .	396.6738
so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode .	634.4563
we have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial andrews norton , by saying that , while he believed jesus `` like other religious teachers ' ' , worked miracles , `` i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine ' ' .	533.5992
i have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt .	201.46216
it has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this .	360.96194
i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world .	279.32495
in an amateurish , yet in a very real sense , i have followed the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields .	483.69342
at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a `` higher criticism ' ' of the bible , to refute which i felt the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology , for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure .	350.35062
doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , bible-emancipated race .	881.9955
although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book , i stood outside shivering in the cold .	307.19003
in one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreached themselves , in claiming that the gospel of john was not written in john ' s time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 a . d . .	361.15475
now , if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking through his servant , it is john ' s gospel .	272.39795
to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible .	591.46173
here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of pragmatism , or the thing that works .	417.84677
test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle .	241.95549
so , i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and then tested it to see how it worked .	395.5441
as a short , possibly not the best method , i looked up `` word ' ' in the concordance and noted that the bible claims from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god ' s personal message to man .	446.96997
the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science ' ' , and i submitted to its conditions according to christ ' s invitation and promise that , `` if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself ' ' ( john 7 17 ) .	281.5004
the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god , son of man by the virgin mary , the saviour of the world .	344.519
i believe , therefore , that we are without exception sinners , by nature alienated from god , and that jesus christ , the son of god , came to earth , the representative head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives christ as his personal saviour is `` born again ' ' spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destined to live and grow in his likeness forever .	375.3045
nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable `` moral life ' ' , although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues .	591.8519
i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well , to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth .	414.63577
to state fully what the bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends .	1016.5599
the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body .	416.6079
again , as faith reveals god my father and christ my saviour , i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer .	820.395
i place his precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability , dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to him .	3541.3967
i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world .	366.90897
our lord ' s invitation with its implied promise to all is , `` come and see ' ' .	275.4143
i stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain .	3675.6946
as i ministered to his needs , i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord .	309.82043
in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said , `` peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth , give i unto you .	562.77563
let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid ' ' .	255.97485
what a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him .	722.51587
he was about to leave them , to depart from this world , and return to his father in heaven .	233.94225
before he left them he promised that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds .	355.45334
i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ .	286.86435
it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord ' s guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients .	386.5977
how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room , asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and his creatures .	909.4113
looking unto god , the prophet isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago `` thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee ' ' .	1476.0029
are you longing for peace in your heart ? ?	149.01457
such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .	1006.5344
as only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own .	293.9287
perhaps you are not his child .	198.39128
perhaps you do not know if you belong to him .	174.85826
you may know that you are in god ' s family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father .	198.1433
`` god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' , and `` as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	294.85968
it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace	373.00412
not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy .	701.1193
why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now , accept him as your saviour and let him fill you with peace that only he can give .	879.5604
then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say	507.81287
`` i am resting today in his wonderful peace ,	207.81207
i am kept from all danger by night and by day ,	267.28754
and his glory is flooding my soul ' ' .	890.6093

our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer space , which have captured the imagination of the american public .	443.62845
cape canaveral ' s achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper .	688.31
while we are filling outer space with scientific successes , for many the `` inner ' ' space of their soul is an aching void .	670.2711
an average of 50 suicides are reported in america each day ! !	701.85187
one out of every three or four marriages ends in divorce ! !	1039.6545

delinquency , juvenile and adult , is at an all-time high ! !	498.30154
unfortunately , in our rush to beat the russians , we have forgotten these truth-packed words of jesus christ `` what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world ( that includes outer space ) , and lose his own soul ? ?	954.91547
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ' ' ? ?	105.674
( mark 36 , 37 ) .	196.43472
gaining outer space and losing `` inner ' ' space is bad business according to god ' s standards .	287.09137
it is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments	750.199
only a fool would think otherwise .	513.89655
but we must not forget man ' s soul .	141.4705
is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that god put his son , jesus christ , on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls ? ?	907.6101
`` for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life ' ' ( john 3	628.9005

your spiritual `` inner ' ' space helps determine the spirituality of america as a nation .	305.28165
we trust you are not one of the 70 , 000 , 000 americans who do not attend church , but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than worshipping the god who made our country great .	478.1793
is forgiveness of past sins , assurance of present help , and hope of future bliss in your orbit ? ?	660.891
or are you trying the devil ' s substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within ? ?	591.42786
pleasure , fame and fortune , drowning your troubles with a drink , and `` living it up ' ' with the gang are like candy bars when you ' re hungry they may ease your hunger temporarily , but they ' ll never take the place of a satisfying , mouth-watering steak .	643.7113
no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your `` inner ' ' space .	563.2172
because your soul was made to be filled with god himself , not religious functions `` about ' ' him .	291.83258
only he can satisfy the deepest longings .	1951.3835
that is why the bible commands you to `` taste and see that the lord is good blessed ( happy ) is the man that trusteth in him ' ' ( psalm 34 8 ) .	858.54486
you can receive god into your heart and life by a step of personal faith .	299.8949
accept the sinless son of god , jesus christ , as your own personal saviour .	333.17145
`` as many as received him ( jesus ) , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name ' ' .	242.5667

of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	30.507639
a certain teacher scheduled a `` fear party ' ' for her fourth grade pupils .	293.48795
it was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears , to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely .	264.81424
the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks `` wouldn ' t it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries ' ' ? ?	213.14177
dr . george w . crane , a medical columnist , thinks it would .	559.6793
he says `` that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously .	6783.791
each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors .	2874.9236
of this number , 50% , or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever .	5062.846
yet they keep running from one physician to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles .	626.4926
one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions ' ' .	768.05023
we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days .	250.94832
it must be getting more serious .	492.8822
people are giving their doctors a hard time .	606.86255
one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles , and he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened	593.9321
30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control	1775.295
12% of them worried about their health , although their ailments were imaginary	1054.476
10% of them worried about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves .	319.74164
only 8% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention .	3001.746
well , most of our fears may be unfounded , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fears ? ?	523.60815
what is the real cause of them ? ?	160.62248
what is there about us that makes us so anxious ? ?	415.44977
look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries .	358.31296
we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers .	4803.071
we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling .	861.8686
we spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment .	989.749
we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment ' s relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart .	859.1695

he should have said `` jittery ' ' , for that ' s what we are .	106.21014
watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something .	1089.8625
in one of his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates .	3612.7737
yes , and as tension mounts in this world , fear is increasing .	612.13043
does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business ? ?	309.05435
we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons , dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate .	671.75354
i doubt that `` fear parties ' ' and `` group confessionals ' ' will help very much .	252.31293
suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ?	141.5799
isn ' t that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers ? ?	384.15585
maybe we are talking about them too much .	408.54865
the question is what are we going to do about them ? ?	484.6282
meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can .	344.80615
hitler did just that 23 years ago , building up tensions that first led to a munich and then to a world war .	324.6158
the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate .	646.3879
it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack .	1862.5587
it could have the same effect on communists .	1144.1552
the president of the united states has said `` we will never negotiate out of fear , and we will never fear to negotiate ' ' .	136.45673
that is a sound position , but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid .	199.87082
and that ' s another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears , to develop the poise that promotes peace .	787.6795
turning to the word of god , we find the only sure way to do that .	113.14747
in psalm 27 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip `` the lord is my light and my salvation	461.21878
the lord is the strength of my life	220.74536
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	30.507639
well , you say , those are beautiful words all right , but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day .	231.53261
he didn ' t live in a world of perpetual peril like ours .	704.29083
he didn ' t know anything about the problems we face today .	557.97815
read the next two verses `` when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .	1448.4327
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me , in this will i be confident ' ' .	589.4152
that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today , isn ' t it ? ?	159.39636
our enemy is also threatening to devour us .	962.5261
he has already devoured huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire , reducing them to slavery , systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison .	850.5766
yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us .	5967.983
what a terrible thing , that `` wailing wall ' ' in berlin ! !	181.05261
a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family .	382.3882
another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west , but was shot and killed .	235.10147
a middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall , she threw out a few belongings and then jumped	449.58673
the entrance to a church has been walled up , so that the congregation , most of which is in the western sector , cannot worship god there anymore .	545.7033
practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city .	177.52077
people stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings , weeping , pounding it with their fists , pleading for loved ones .	2755.3755
but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity .	3679.9983
there is only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are taking it suicide .	760.5685
the normal rate of suicides in east berlin was one a day , but since the border was closed on august 13 it has jumped to 25 a day ! !	345.16327
these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door .	844.9708
we are all involved in them , deeply involved .	225.77931
and nobody knows what comes next .	1283.6582
we live from crisis to crisis .	200.7623
and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world .	221.33931
he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world `` the lord is my light and my salvation	672.51636
the lord is the strength of my life	220.74536
of whom shall i be afraid ' ' ? ?	30.507639
notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith .	232.07985
first , `` the lord is my light ' ' .	160.75082
he lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark .	121.561325
the same god who called this world into being when he said `` let there be light ' ' ! !	130.70956
-- those were his very first creative words -- he began the world with light -- this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness .	624.7629
for those who put their trust in him he still says every day again `` let there be light ' ' ! !	238.73433
in fact , he came into this world himself , in the person of his son , jesus christ , who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said `` i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life ' ' .	262.47018
the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ .	265.23343
he could only see the light coming over the horizon .	240.83322
we live in the bright daylight of that great event	1112.0923
for us it is a fact in history .	111.15303
why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it gives ? ?	164.8491
this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of god `` the lord is my salvation ' ' .	413.00412
he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins .	337.88684
if god could do that , he could do anything .	117.71238
the enemies at his gate , threatening to eat up his flesh , were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul .	414.4901
and god had conquered that one by his grace ! !	209.9305
so why worry about all the others ? ?	81.1319
the apostle paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament `` he that spared not his own son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him freely give us all things ? ?	392.64136
if god be for us , who can be against us ? ?	78.20511
who shall separate us from the love of christ ? ?	63.724895
shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ' ' ? ?	302.83475
( romans 31 , 32 , 35 )	451.01935
this is the key to the conquest of fear .	138.41605
this gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with god , whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against him .	554.16895
when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ , when we know that he is our savior , that he has paid our debt with his blood , that he has met the demands of god ' s justice and thus has turned his wrath away -- when we know that , we have peace with god in our hearts	282.99106
and then , with this god on our side , we can face the whole world without fear .	198.2221
and so the psalmist gives us one more picture of god `` the lord is the strength of my life ' ' .	139.66653
the word is really `` stronghold ' ' .	46.25444
it recalls those words of another psalm `` god is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .	535.66187
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come , behold the works of the lord , what desolations he hath made in the earth .	321.341
but , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century a . d . , when an arabic scholar , tabit ibn korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .	584.233
thus , while it remains possible that the babylonians and/or the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .	747.3708
the `` lo shu ' ' square as an expression of centrality	185.65079
the concept of the middle kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the warring states , was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the ch ' in dynasty ( 221-207 b . c . ) .	670.0964
but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .	2473.4265
among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor , shih huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 b . c . , with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking	700.82654
but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared .	624.70215
many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast ch ' in palace some ten years later	279.45016
yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 b . c . to a . d . 220 ) .	531.5308
in fact , during the first century b . c . , an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called `` wei books ' ' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination .	415.74487
however , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 .	1531.6505
after all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .	277.20978
but , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the han period .	478.21692
although modern scholars have expressed surprise that `` the simple magic square of three ' ' , a mere `` mathematical puzzle ' ' , was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself .	275.82703
but , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts .	668.5644
such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram .	357.97464
the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .	698.75305
indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram .	389.07657
if one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals .	371.7138
then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45	424.28
and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed .	200.2502
furthermore , the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position	323.43707
it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 .	451.73932
in fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese .	718.5397
for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature	771.8365
and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other .	498.2082
thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .	604.7526
the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality .	285.16217
these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty .	124.71632
the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century b . c . , when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences .	768.0436
his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the lo shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter ' s efficacy .	223.3009
after this time , inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one ' s self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .	827.06055
later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally .	1034.528
all this emphasis on centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 b . c . , also may conceivably have led to the development of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .	292.9568
we find , for example , such groupings as the five ancient rulers , the five sacred mountains , the five directions ( with center ) , the five metals , five colors , five tastes , five odors , five musical notes , five bodily functions , five viscera , and many others .	706.5883
this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest	268.41675
but why did the old chinese postulate five elements , when the ancient near east -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ? ?	1323.5625
and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ?	703.99164
obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives , and that may have been the workings of the lo shu .	184.61299
this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking .	1485.9977
whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought .	1115.6254
scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries .	998.55817
yin and yang in the `` lo shu ' ' square	39.438526
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .	272.24213
for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time .	614.4943
as such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu	1090.4911
but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .	297.52576
the chinese world view during the han dynasty , when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang and five-elements school , which was traditionally founded by tsou yen .	340.60217
according to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by heaven , t ' ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a supreme sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the tao , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the order of the universe ' ' or `` the universal way ' ' .	322.69562
heaven , acting through the tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles , the yin and the yang .	308.90274
the yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the sun	487.40085
while the yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the moon .	680.5125
together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything .	678.9713
we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang , while the even numbers were yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .	778.80194
during the han dynasty , another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo shu , considering the latter as a plan of ancient china .	308.58063
instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence yin )	1008.7658
taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china .	253.01823
thus the middle number , 5 , represented sung-shan in honan , central china	3681.518
the 3 , t ' ai-shan in shantung , east china	3288.5398
the 7 , hwa-shan in shensi , west china	3861.3013
the 1 , heng-shan in hopei , north china ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring shansi )	1426.9698
and the 9 , huo-shan in anhwei , which was then the south sacred mountain .	1907.7483
for the rivers , the 4 represented the huai , to the ( then ) southeast	466.7601
the 2 , the san kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) southwest	1442.7164
the 8 , the chi in the northeast	5148.168
and the 6 , the ( upper ) yellow river in the northwest .	193.14986
note that by western standards this plan was `` upside down ' ' , as it put north at the bottom and south at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered	378.06033
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps .	520.0395
the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces	399.1634
and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .	565.67993
few persons who join the church are insincere .	1132.5338
they earnestly desire to do the will of god .	84.7686
when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve christian stature , it is an indictment of the church .	275.26306
these fatalities are dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism ' ' , a failure to follow through .	185.83412
a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .	1384.9211
the work of lay visitation evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed .	704.7843
in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to christ and the church .	462.13217
the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .	1676.1334
the first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the church .	390.7536
neglect means spiritual paralysis or death .	166.99585
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active .	928.9854
this is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency ' ' .	88.89775
it is important that persons desiring to unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant .	688.12164
it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications .	999.2307
preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received .	875.8051
the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual , expressing his joy over the decision , assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time , and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday .	714.86346
some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors .	341.85638
it should not be postponed later than the next day .	757.24316
a helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter .	142.69807
the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference .	331.71637
if possible , he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present .	232.75635
this is not a social call .	573.57416
it is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference ' ' .	223.94197
he will discuss the significance of christian commitment , the necessity of family religion and private devotions , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions .	404.93228
there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel .	869.3634
each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .	2071.4624
a piece of devotional material , such as the upper room , may be left in each home .	147.3725
a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults .	535.49866
those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows .	416.56244
they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them .	532.3853
many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .	1027.4786
others meet on sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights .	243.45036
some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between .	662.69543
the sessions should cover four major areas a	843.2148
-- history of the church	1606.3948
-- duties of church membership	8655.221
-- the local church and its program	478.12024
following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week .	515.9062
this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet .	1994.8151
most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday .	528.9168
in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church .	326.14267
the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life , service opportunities , the church school , missions , men ' s work , women ' s work , youth program , social activities , and finances .	221.68237
the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session .	867.9849
an `` interest finder ' ' or `` talent sheet ' ' may be filled out by each person .	97.310425
( see sample on pp . 78-79 .	2267.056
) the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments .	276.59247
the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members .	341.3351
in conducting the membership preparation-inquirers ' class , the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class .	602.9967
the following have been found effective .	1046.6976
some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally held on sunday night or during the week .	558.3145
this gives greater opportunity for the learning process .	162.60086
use dramatization -- for example , in discussing the lord ' s supper or church symbolism .	250.8604
some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session .	965.16833
have a `` question box ' ' .	32.347687
some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .	3867.1716
urge them to write out their questions for the box .	235.95184
use a textbook with assigned readings each week .	9034.446
select class members for reports on various phases of the study .	180.35785
conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet .	8400.056
ask each member to write a statement on such topics as `` what christ means to me ' ' , `` what the church means to me ' ' , `` why join the church ' ' , `` the duties of church members ' ' , etc . .	158.99017
assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized .	6808.64
invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week .	847.0553
ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service .	394.3227
there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training , including those coming by transfer of membership .	748.62805
george e . sweazey writes `` there is danger in trying to make admission to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened ' ' .	282.08746
people appreciate experiences that demand something of them .	446.08377
those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule .	295.93723
for most of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches .	167.62852
those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .	514.8372
the preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .	2180.25
it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations .	190.79147
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church .	519.09357
this should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience .	714.55066
they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages .	657.1123
every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation .	619.2179
this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation .	245.61519
it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church .	117.31113
it can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .	523.3755
the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church .	264.78494
the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .	799.93744
psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon .	141.75201
ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete `` talent sheets ' ' and pledge cards .	289.17148
some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register .	1600.8472
provide a name card for each new member .	376.18085
outline plans for the entire service .	339.79352
arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together .	364.4566
sponsors may sit with them also .	260.501
invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service .	246.06792
give each new member a certificate of membership .	272.86478
introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation .	160.421
lead the congregation in a response of welcome .	256.5673
have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service .	441.72745
take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board .	184.94781
have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests .	523.1532
chapter 6 planning for the assimilation and growth of new members	255.63344
the church is `` the family of god ' ' .	40.25012
the members of the `` family ' ' are drawn together by a common love for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom .	352.85373
every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .	257.21466
this is no spectator-type experience	2197.2212
everyone is to be a participant .	534.87067
yet the most difficult problem in the church ' s program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .	253.39421
very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive .	560.39496
a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years .	536.1653
one denomination had a membership of 1 , 419 , 833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1 , 541 , 991 -- a net growth of only 122 , 158 .	726.38727
yet during the same period there were 1 , 080 , 062 additions .	2627.6245
another major church body had 4 , 499 , 608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4 , 622 , 444 .	1792.3132
during this time 4 , 122 , 354 new members were brought into the fellowship .	1685.8973
still another denomination had 7 , 360 , 187 members twenty years ago .	4601.7837
during this period 7 , 484 , 268 members were received , yet the net membership now is only 9 , 910 , 741 .	2385.1404
these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .	466.48282
this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship .	542.9308
studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received .	521.57874
something is wrong when these things happen .	741.41296
the local `` family of god ' ' has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .	618.8917
new members can become participating , growing members .	1550.8229
but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .	341.4937
it must be planned and carefully developed .	540.2852
the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process .	284.47754
if the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .	499.5196
those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .	1112.437
however , it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship .	446.4964
when they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians .	414.2753
the church expects certain things of those who become members .	760.25336
the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family	1366.7404
-- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible	143.7592
-- guidance in christian social concerns .	590.3051
men need unity and they need god .	319.33908
care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .	726.3215
the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .	662.2254
to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race .	551.6619
massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .	597.1527
the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind `` oh how we hate one another for the love of god ' ' ! !	552.2072
the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .	332.3381
institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion .	467.6104
a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms	173.06206
to escape this fate , it must rule some things out .	243.16437
for every criterion which defines what something is , at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not .	1488.4855
some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether	1076.5388
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .	445.0109
man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .	1919.1544
having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance .	600.253
to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools .	1712.3312
both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible .	430.19806
as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him .	821.6686
yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .	737.80084
is there any way out of the predicament ? ?	145.4992
the only way that i can see is through communication .	149.83417
interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .	903.8406
approached creatively , it is a high art .	121.556046
it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart god ' s intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary .	1149.9414
in a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states .	6718.1987
what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ?	529.41614
i shall touch on three areas personal , national , and theological .	1258.0007
by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure .	1138.7787
some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .	656.28314
such needs may rise to pathological proportions .	692.1684
modern psychology has shown that paralleling `` the authoritarian personality ' ' is `` the bigoted personality ' ' in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally .	557.3527
fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us .	378.33212
to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .	700.03766
interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever .	919.5119
it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .	405.02594
while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .	1974.033
the specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .	259.8295
emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires .	1235.6593
no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since world war 2 , , and the number is growing by the year .	220.10715
as an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and non-christians in these lands .	2161.4128
colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .	470.22626
actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .	144.51543
nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries .	730.5483
the truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nations very much need .	1454.4027
insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else ' s .	951.64624
all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which christian missions stand .	1507.0535
africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .	435.92587
the people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , christians on the mainland of china .	259.82355
for example , in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion .	2025.399
in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7 , 000 , 000 buddhists and the lament of its 800 , 000 roman catholics .	1312.1025
again , india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone .	1761.4282
the progressive closing of afro-asian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo .	1109.0421
i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists ' world radio program .	514.9592
he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .	421.86984
after returning to the united states and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available .	283.6353
it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval	324.30792
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .	1737.1017
it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-christian sentiment .	1424.8165
ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since world war 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs .	996.85736
although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and non-christians in asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions themselves .	1149.7128
the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims	9051.385
neither has the establishment of the state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews .	592.7198
i turn finally to several theological developments .	3140.3025
the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form .	899.3295
the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ' ' .	616.13947
one of our foremost jurists , david dudley field , has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history ' ' .	473.99246
the trend throughout the world ' s religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment .	307.70096
pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation .	536.4269
`` what is the point ' ' , charles adams reports the pakistanis as asking , `` in demanding an islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is ' ' ? ?	323.16867
the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular .	16434.719
and while the nation was formerly named `` the islamic republic of pakistan ' ' , it is now simply `` the republic of pakistan ' ' .	368.5453
comparable trends can be noted elsewhere .	656.66534
the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor .	8948.577
the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .	558.80707
during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .	897.66
now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise .	1022.1262
and in this country gustave weigel ' s delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state .	1065.5829
the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigel ' s theological argument .	815.4461
everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine .	592.47003
my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them .	1489.1136
that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .	477.66107
i do not mean to imply that christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .	721.3224
leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says , `` we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it ' ' .	432.98477
newbiggin ' s qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance .	225.33737
the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests , father feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church .	749.76874
in mentioning this under `` salvation reconsidered ' ' i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .	351.2082
when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit ' ' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .	317.87863
of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .	1521.3931
yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man ' s own action .	385.58957
i mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit ' ' .	208.9189
he is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general .	375.9122
he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good .	1251.2161
he is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both	512.7916
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .	534.7245
this is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit ' ' an evil result means .	472.4713
it means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends .	414.92023
of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits ' ' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .	211.98366
certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives , `` it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative ' ' .	408.59555
naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account .	141.1946
especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .	447.96683
presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account .	422.84558
there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm .	1032.9595
if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil .	738.8447
nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences .	700.0083
he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .	192.29274
above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .	809.05743
he does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit ' ' in the sense explained .	467.7924
by contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done	280.52557
and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone ' s doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .	589.58777
mr . philip toynbee writes , for example , that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues .	384.60144
if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin ' ' .	245.58322
against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we `` negotiate at once with the russians and get the best terms which are available ' ' , that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness ' ' .	321.85165
he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i . e . , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by russia within a few years .	272.20905
this would be by far the better choice , when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish ' ' .	331.36447
nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified it is `` a possible result , however improbable ' '	548.3736
`` the worst , and least probable ' ' result	2314.9807
`` if it didn ' t prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing ' '	161.09396
for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	185.71577
if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test ' ' `` have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are ' ' ? ?	261.79446
thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality	19106.125
it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done .	202.1583
several of the replies to mr . toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .	711.3499
`` it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation ' ' .	132.77147
`` i am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .	1809.4602
but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced ' ' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?	383.74374
) `` quoting mr . kennan ' s phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war ' ' .	293.9859
`` if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter ' ' .	298.0698
`` if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , i think he is right .	235.7801
i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war ' ' .	137.54362
even professor arnold toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms `` compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .	430.39893
let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be ' ' .	314.28537
mr . philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four , if he believed communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil ' ' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .	563.5799
even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday ' ' .	1455.0658
no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .	627.83264
but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .	775.4181
on their way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .	482.31226
not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .	1176.2318
toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .	460.05948
`` i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation ' ' .	894.37524
would such an act of refusal be useful ? ?	520.43317
he does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that `` if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender ' ' .	384.60876
he wants to be `` brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far , far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956 ' ' .	689.0416
this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world ' s arsenal of unlimited weapons .	394.88416
it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .	970.9462
`` it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples .	1670.6699
hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop ' ' .	117.192604
this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last	474.31738
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .	4419.6724
the only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war	154.7064
and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .	759.0935
that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted ' ' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .	947.8738
finally , just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to accelerate this end .	437.43445
we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind ' s thrusts toward we know not what future .	637.8582
much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging ' ' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .	731.76575
for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most americans .	1006.2537
few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .	1524.5295
this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics	9684.767
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .	439.76617
it is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the national association of real estate boards ( nareb ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure .	585.46814
how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?	916.0
what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?	129.86676
what ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?	385.30484
what social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?	482.05774
recently , a group of the faculty at wesleyan university ' s public affairs center sought some answers to these questions .	772.79144
several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .	1297.0591
here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .	624.5976
for a number of years , wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .	569.0541
this article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .	288.49994
such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .	2539.424
within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public ' ' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .	595.6843
professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .	489.23383
but as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .	311.51096
obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor ' s role .	887.3001
judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers ' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction	1280.8604
and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial ' ' , `` happy ' ' relations to other people in certain community areas .	184.85251
how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of nareb ' s code of ethics article 34 in the code , adopted in 1924 , states that `` a realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood ' ' .	865.6128
though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such `` detrimental ' ' influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid .	846.7827
the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms	2069.1958
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .	4712.1343
they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals ' ' but agitators for some kind of `` cause ' ' or `` reform ' ' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro ' ' .	161.68732
obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional ' ' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one ' s work .	333.39346
these men -- for the most part educated in our `` best ' ' new england colleges , well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship ' ' .	670.83136
this narrow `` professionalism ' ' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .	203.77045
as our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship ' ' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating ' ' became evident .	217.35474
realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc . .	343.7184
from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .	926.82715
it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue	946.47815
( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes	583.2114
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro ' ' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .	174.23718
( 1 ) most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .	381.33124
there is some reality to this	56.739204
the commission on race and housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced , on the whole , than any other segment of the american population ' ' .	464.24118
but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices .	1228.9858
also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed .	436.6315
like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .	1133.0508
realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .	978.23676
recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion .	334.70343
there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes ' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc . .	630.14624
data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .	312.43286
often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically .	406.5943
significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the university of california press ) that present the commission ' s findings .	311.24625
no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised .	337.37454
the role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration .	370.3524
relevant `` facts ' ' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` harmonious ' ' neighborhoods .	366.7956
discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one ' s democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .	516.7465
`` against the grain of creation ' '	85.54963
( 2 ) realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing .	644.0469
on the positive side , recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position	3515.8284
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .	1310.2439
realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in connecticut ' s new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey ' ' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .	235.71738
as far as they were aware , the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the bill ' s passage or lobbied in its support .	688.28345
( this has not been the case everywhere .	288.10425
in 1957 , the real estate boards of new york city actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law .	3930.7017
official reasoning the bill was a `` wanton invasion of basic property rights ' ' .	278.88828
there are sins of omission as well as commission	3738.5488
the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced .	430.56808
judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v . kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible .	4688.8193
such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .	341.57788
in the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of `` social reformism ' ' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid .	1067.1902
but as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods .	1670.1992
one of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .	573.1066
but responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , american good .	532.376
such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces scarsdale or yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive .	889.29504
that community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment .	324.95557
racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator .	322.8397
thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions .	468.84506
( 3 ) over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .	414.36105
most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as `` professional people ' ' with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions .	609.7603
but what significance attaches to `` professional ' ' , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client ' s stated needs as already noted ? ?	406.23404
our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .	914.89514
as a theologian in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who `` professed ' ' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills .	272.1862
if we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion .	353.51053
science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom .	153.89142
religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .	490.24664
how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ?	322.26108
we may feel pessimistic at the outlook .	88.928276
and yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision .	441.14645
we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .	358.63397
and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .	373.931
to see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom .	152.81218
you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on hiroshima .	768.2747
it was only about the size of a baseball	79.73174
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20 , 000 tons of aj .	494.0097
that is enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state building	511.9292
and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem .	196.52907
now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .	482.413
but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb .	766.7559
hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .	2250.7322
we know that we have hydrogen in water	2790.1785
water is af and the h stands for hydrogen	565.3744
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .	455.19336
i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima .	401.29434
i won ' t try the experiment , but i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .	219.82774
and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond .	460.9255
salt water is still af , the same hydrogen is there .	185.97942
and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today .	360.5697
of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture .	232.99487
for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days .	320.62366
and think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make .	440.39697
with just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .	117.012634
then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .	189.1371
it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .	1727.0231
now let us see where this power comes from .	537.2575
to grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is .	189.07875
i have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .	274.07513
one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms	864.49536
and i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ?	765.49774
i calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body	496.84787
that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number .	1400.4246
then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator	2498.6511
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic	1126.4124
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people	203.053
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia .	145.11578
i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so i decided to take another measure -- the whole state of pennsylvania .	196.48213
imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas	2177.5737
so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep .	919.61145
you can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars	429.74823
pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .	1522.3407
but we still have a long way to go .	105.845215
next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- north america , south america , europe , asia , and africa , all covered with peas four feet deep	719.975
next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep	646.78284
finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way	2120.866
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body .	1144.6829
so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .	437.62848
now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .	332.74152
let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill .	1279.5033
i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .	1660.3212
i shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long .	358.85806
then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .	1134.2264
and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .	503.9098
these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone .	880.4059
since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom .	277.14645
so you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin .	246.64684
this is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus .	356.55267
even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead .	431.56186
it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits	2940.4045
it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .	229.41982
you may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space .	455.24002
and since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .	453.43323
if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper .	625.90674
someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .	540.7375
at any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .	1028.3197
now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture .	220.82327
for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics	3338.61
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine	728.7481
and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .	192.8228
so if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine	452.3269
and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine .	566.1114
and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom .	781.3626
and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .	2327.0984
then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920 ' s .	128.51599
a suggestion from louis de broglie , a physicist in france , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves .	689.9461
and to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .	403.22705
now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it .	837.12134
these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .	1363.7925
and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .	451.50888
it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .	471.56897
harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there	15084.367
and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe .	601.93866
and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music .	175.75052
the island of nantucket , part of the state of massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state .	269.26398
some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living .	425.82056
the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors	6741.284
the rest is obtained from harbor scallops .	9019.51
during about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers , food , and cars	205.84592
but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime .	614.57434
this is a fine trip , too , on a good day .	139.66194
with martha ' s vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .	392.07837
to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century ? ?	200.20648
how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age ? ?	483.9652
to what extent did it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? ?	243.95724
a complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the christian faith data are unobtainable .	888.7952
even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors .	470.92432
although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .	377.66577
at times we can say that it was the major factor .	102.93582
what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation .	466.6595
as we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches .	362.43326
presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater or lesser extent .	455.7789
many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse .	410.63278
the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock , for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration	309.93793
for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was roman catholicism , and for a small minority it was eastern orthodoxy .	407.7911
upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation .	210.40782
upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was .	387.7656
yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of christianity would be impossible .	505.44778
at best only an approximation could be arrived at .	743.5489
to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .	318.76962
for instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose .	479.6113
the temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level .	476.73087
we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed .	1437.8463
thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .	1314.0999
if guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership .	1335.1097
as church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude .	1717.6967
but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know .	279.7136
what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .	376.37354
we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .	390.6331
we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards , and through leaders in the government .	341.6077
throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock .	971.2861
by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .	1073.349
in the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .	343.00443
the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock .	425.2473
thus `` america ' ' , the most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a new england baptist clergyman , samuel francis smith ( 1808-1895 ) , while a student in andover theological seminary .	570.7422
with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals .	751.0992
the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith .	285.50272
here was what was called the american dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it .	327.04688
later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine lee bates ( 1859-1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of new england congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 , `` america the beautiful ' ' , with the words `` o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness .	1053.7316
america , america , god mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law .	3490.4114
o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .	10931.285
america , america , god shed his grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea ' ' .	1179.2307
the american dream was compounded of many strains .	1708.4066
some were clearly of christian origin , among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty , christian equality , and christian fraternity the passion of the land .	437.57425
some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountain-head of the american hope .	358.94568
here , too , must be placed unitarianism and , less obviously from christian inspiration , emerson , transcendentalism , and the idealism of walt whitman .	1824.9413
we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them melville , hawthorne , and henry james the elder , all of them out of a christian background .	593.3691
with such a dream arising , at least in part , from the protestant heritage of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression .	168.18625
a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .	643.228
significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism .	549.6582
several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .	1185.435
quakers , some from new england , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .	1976.5469
we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints , the seventh day adventists , christian science , the american board of commissioners for foreign missions , the american home missionary society , the american bible society , and new england theology .	861.00635
the atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills .	345.46902
the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked for the early coming of the millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man ' s ability cherished by the unitarians , emerson , and the transcendentalists .	549.15125
we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the inner mission , and the red cross .	685.51276
we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .	563.1388
a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .	727.6585
several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .	275.86725
some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .	316.25845
still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age .	575.597
the movement to end negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until , as a result of the civil war , emancipation was achieved .	523.36676
long before 1815 the christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly .	1148.5079
for example , in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .	1647.922
in the latter year samuel hopkins , from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name , asked the continental congress to abolish slavery .	1511.5082
as we have seen , methodism early took a stand against slavery .	1760.5936
beginning at least as far back as 1789 various baptist bodies condemned slavery .	5029.1367
after 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock .	690.49084
the nineteenth-century immigration , whether protestant or roman catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves .	684.34485
the anti-slavery movement took many forms .	482.09818
benjamin lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies .	316.95523
it was he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .	544.70917
garrison , massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer .	4252.595
chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition ' ' , he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women ' s rights , prohibition , and justice to the indians .	459.9182
incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout baptist , in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john greenleaf whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible .	926.3332
a marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals .	585.39026
finney himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign .	484.56512
theodore dwight weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .	402.49054
weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational ministers .	1044.9303
as a youth he became one of finney ' s band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .	522.9282
a strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , charles stewart , another finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause .	432.57675
a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position .	1322.0083
the majority then went to the infant oberlin .	770.66077
they and others employed some of finney ' s techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .	413.354
weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as joshua r . giddings and edwin m . stanton , enlisted john quincy adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay harriet beecher stowe ' s uncle tom ' s cabin .	2066.3594
he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .	569.2037
wendell phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher .	584.10095
although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remained a devout christian .	730.35846
he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition .	597.25116
the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by arthur tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother , lewis tappan ( 1788-1873 ) .	1313.1378
individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits	3170.3396
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities .	1194.5862
their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe .	504.2771
royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .	21752.148
thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors .	1436.3518
but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .	1913.655
since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living .	292.77887
the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .	290.06802
proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world	350.4275
but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom .	1504.0397
this is the familiar system of `` cosmic government ' ' .	74.69746
the chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .	2178.5645
he regulated the dualities of light and darkness , yang and yin , which are locked in eternal struggle .	666.57513
by swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons .	781.0617
his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions .	1558.0593
in this system , no man is exempt from obligations .	2091.0168
failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one ' s family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead .	863.2497
and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters .	5244.0977
the family home was , in fact , a temple	100.20931
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature .	446.54648
the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .	311.51038
the common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .	569.52484
the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .	556.9542
men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .	1283.3866
if the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .	489.0659
modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection .	451.2377
living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes .	1271.5854
basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns .	3577.0574
in china , the magical system par excellence was taoism .	7469.176
the taoists were quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the tao -- underlying all phenomena .	1215.4435
it was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .	309.77847
the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation	1401.7179
in other words , they were actually an organization of magicians .	584.64844
mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .	1814.6013
after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china , it underwent extensive changes .	1348.9204
during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader .	1377.4039
mahayana had gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world .	1704.7219
the self-realized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .	5174.922
the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden .	530.76666
in its monastic form , mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who catered to the chinese faith in the supernatural .	960.05493
nonmagical confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .	338.80823
confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .	977.817
if a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him .	421.43875
but let us not be mistaken about confucian `` virtue ' '	640.32544
this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation .	307.96222
to the confucian , `` virtue ' ' simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .	1134.9692
propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .	601.1237
to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man ' s fate .	492.1675
this , in brief , was the historical background out of which zen emerged .	436.17142
promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry , and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism .	1300.645
but the `` marvelous person ' ' that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality than indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls .	1205.7369
proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen , probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic .	3373.0972
but in the chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be .	408.04672
actually , zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism .	4593.484
the ch ' an ( zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from mahayana , but its psychology was pure early taoist .	4321.649
this is well evidenced by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity , peace , and stillness -- a union with the infinite , with the tao -- could be effected .	914.9729
in fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the `` direct thinking ' ' zennist was a feature of taoism .	1874.1984
so , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .	1019.40094
zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .	151.11543
one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .	1556.9304
one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse .	1835.193
but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it .	959.81287
it is simply that in taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books , words , or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience .	683.9899
the truth -- the eternal truth -- is not transmittable by words .	1219.0741
reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap .	416.2743
the technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind ' s grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century b . c . chinese quietism the koan is not basically a new device .	858.8123
it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man .	397.03503
in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers .	2272.6255
and this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest `` wonder drug ' ' .	793.1981
early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence .	3636.6675
but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .	364.9968
the anchorite strove , in fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power .	480.13437
thus , the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation .	1574.5833
as the zen literature reveals , as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers .	546.48157
the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles .	1622.0106
exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of china , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe .	1518.7104
in support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power .	658.4915
but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity `` hwang pah ( o baku ) , one day going up mount tien tai which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light .	1439.5972
they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent .	981.0849
there being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore	158.36429
but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him .	1561.4666
thereupon hwang pah said `` if i knew thou art an arhat , i would have doubled you up before thou got over there ' ' ! !	1768.7516
the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah , and praised him as a true mahayanist .	3448.2239
a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess `` on one occasion yang shan ( kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .	1393.7175
when that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation , he asked `` where art thou from ' ' ? ?	568.271
`` early this morning ' ' , replied the other , `` i set out from india ' ' .	71.21804
`` why ' ' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late ' ' ? ?	181.1457
`` i stopped ' ' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful sceneries ' ' .	555.86005
`` thou mayst have supernatural powers ' ' , exclaimed yang shan , `` yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me ' ' .	838.0835
then the monk praised yang shan saying `` i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri , and met unexpectedly with minor shakya ' ' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india , went back through the air .	633.77594
in the popular chinese mind , ch ' an ( zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated .	666.0649
a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes .	2638.2021
to the zen monk the universe is still populated with `` spiritual beings ' ' who have to be appeased .	561.20013
part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings ' ' .	636.3198
modern zen presentation to the west insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and so on .	1296.376
this picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as `` o you , demons and other spiritual beings , i now offer this to you , and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith .	1132.1613
pope leo 13 , on the 13th day of december 1898 , granted the following indulgences `` an indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the faithful who read the holy gospels at least a quarter of an hour .	736.0506
a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading ' ' .	211.80563
pope pius the sixth , at rome , in april , 1778 , wrote the following `` the faithful should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times ' ' .	507.95306
the american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible .	679.61487
`` we hope ' ' , they said , `` that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures ' ' .	262.31866
they recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures ' ' .	311.76077
since the catholic church expresses such desire that the sacred scriptures be read , the following taken from the holy bible ( new catholic edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing .	836.38116
do not wonder that i said to thee , `` you must be born again ' ' .	101.41222
the new birth is necessary because god is holy .	541.5746
but as the one who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior	2038.313
for it is written , you shall be holy , because i am holy .	73.09622
1 , st . peter 15 , 16 .	110.02765
holiness without which no man will see god .	290.31418
the new birth is necessary because all have sinned .	869.92944
as it is written , there is not one just man	132.49243
there is none who understands	20355.79
there is none who seeks after god .	867.36096
all have gone astray together	946.4339
all have sinned and have need of the glory of god .	152.03537
romans 3 10-12 , 23 .	237.36673
the new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .	725.63776
therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death , and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned .	1165.4806
you also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .	301.34213
and if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .	867.0359
in their case , the god of this world ( satan ) has blinded their unbelieving minds , that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ , who is the image of god .	189.43938
2 , corinthians 4 3 , 4 .	33.725727
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	241.93922
the new birth is effected through the word of god	417.33142
for you have been reborn , not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible , through the word of god .	1175.2367
of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .	584.35724
amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water ( symbol of the word of god , see ephesians 26 ) and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	274.1571

( the new nature , received at the time of regeneration , is divine and holy , and as the believer lives under the power of this new nature he does not practice sin .	306.17502
) if we are born of god we practice righteousness .	2395.767
if you know that he ( god ) is just ( righteous ) , know that everyone also who does what is just ( righteous ) has been born of him .	306.73923

and this is the victory that overcomes the world , our faith .	469.84436
1 st . john 5 4 .	132.37764
if we are born of god we grow in ( not into , but in ) grace .	579.8929
but grow in grace and knowledge of our lord and savior , jesus christ .	309.8073
if we are born of god we persevere unto the end .	649.5862
i am convinced of this , that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of christ jesus .	271.3224
now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory , without blemish , in gladness , to the only god our savior , through jesus christ our lord , belong glory and majesty , dominion and authority , before all time , and now , and forever .	877.1609
the new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .	759.2933
jesus answered and said to him ( nicodemus ) `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' .	226.61252
`` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .	181.38393
that which is born of the flesh is flesh	275.52942
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .	139.0884
do not wonder that i said to thee , ' you must be born again ' ' ' .	107.97663
st . john 3 3 , 5-7 .	273.7473
the new birth is a new creation .	283.05057
for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account .	2911.3503
if then any man is in christ , he is a new creature ( literally , `` he is a new creation ) , the former things have passed away	219.52753
behold , they are made new ! !	210.49503
for by grace you have been saved through faith	242.28568

not as the outcome of works , lest anyone may boast .	1845.2384
for his workmanship we are , created in christ jesus .	241.93922

he who has not the son has not the life .	128.18214
he who believes in the son ( jesus christ , the son of god ) , has everlasting life .	295.27884
the new birth is the impartation of the divine nature .	729.30054
through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises , so that through them you may become partaker of the divine nature .	685.15393

the new birth is christ living in you by faith .	1048.8455
christ in you , your hope of glory .	558.0234
it is now no longer i that live , but christ lives in me .	903.0109
and the life that i now live in the flesh , i live in the faith of the son of god , who loved me and gave himself up for me .	131.5503
to have christ dwelling through faith in your hearts .	287.81827
the new birth is miraculous and mysterious .	2547.601
the wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes .	1156.7902
so is everyone who is born of the spirit .	66.138626
the new birth is immediate and instantaneous .	2946.8738
amen , amen , i say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has life everlasting , and does not come to judgment , but has passed from death to life .	479.67236
the new birth is a work of god .	75.04672
but to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of god	429.80908
to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .	131.62862
you may be very religious , a good church member , an upright , honest and sincere person	962.544
you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful	24057.441
you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church	1143.1687
you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment .	929.2646
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .	917.6622
our blessed lord jesus christ , the sinless son of god , who could not lie , said , `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god ' ' ( st . john 3 3 ) .	158.86015
`` you must be born again ' ' ( st . john 3 7 ) .	78.87062
being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting christ as saviour , and being convicted by the holy spirit of my lost condition , i do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works , and just now receive jesus as my personal saviour and salvation as a free gift from him .	521.03534
you may do as you please with god now .	573.57605
god placed himself in men ' s hands when he sent jesus christ into the world as perfect god and perfect man in one being .	610.0188
he was then in man ' s hands .	53.70061
finally men arrested him , gave him a mock trial , flogged him , nailed him on a cross and hung him between earth and heaven	858.3456
you can do likewise though christ is not bodily present .	1243.2355
you can ignore his book , the bible , and his church .	93.31788
you can laugh at his blood-bought salvation , curse his followers , and laugh at hell .	1626.3011
the eternal christ may knock at your soul ' s door , calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven .	466.42813
you may refuse him , spit on him , call him a devil , curse him .	555.1536
you may take his name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .	4788.161
he is in your hands -- now .	294.23694
on the other hand , you may seek his favor , humble yourself before him and beg his mercy , implore his forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to him .	1112.9539

the latch is on your side of the door .	89.7063
the choice is yours the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with god	2234.4312
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of holy spirit discipline .	478.7088
the choice is yours god is in your hands , now .	188.81703
god has already set the day when you will be in his hands .	78.230095
what he does with you then depends on what you do with him now .	360.59637
then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god ' ' if you have abused him in your hands .	436.3826
this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .	1745.1791
when i came into being , 15 years ago , i had one primary purpose to help men and women everywhere to know god better , and through knowing him better to become happier and more effective people .	364.52615
when you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts .	234.2595
some of the people who speak through my pages are famous	1710.3009
some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .	1394.7925
some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of god , that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see .	356.81595
fifteen years ago , there were no guideposts at all .	256.93042
this month a million guideposts will circulate all over the world .	661.71747
experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .	4227.617
they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following .	1178.7686
to me , the explanation is very simple .	600.1577
i am not doing anything , of myself .	343.1808
i am merely a channel for something .	843.516
it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn away from it .	316.61685
it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass .	575.7603
it is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .	257.65195
it is mankind ' s wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .	303.2629
all things are possible to god , but he chooses -- usually -- to work through people .	301.4163
sometimes such people sense that they are being used	178.8057
fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .	526.22504
the minister was norman vincent peale .	2962.3176
neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea .	753.9383
they borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2 , 000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called guideposts .	971.22217
compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed .	1648.1389
but from the start they had two important ingredients sincerity and realism .	1220.0447
the people who told the stories were sincere .	553.57947
and the stories they told were true .	507.20715
for example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of new york ' s down-and-outers , he didn ' t just ask questions .	351.8374
len lesourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .	765.93225
that was nearly 13 years ago .	7.7739663
len lesourd is my executive editor today .	1106.7172
many of you are familiar , i ' m sure , with the story of my early struggles the fire in january , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers .	599.62225
the help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .	5044.6035
the crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .	7428.8257
that was when a remarkable woman , teresa durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage .	929.16974
`` you ' re not living up to your own principles ' ' , she told my discouraged people .	320.32642
`` you ' re so preoccupied that you ' ve let your faith grow dim .	1453.6698
what do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ? ?	446.04465
visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them ' ' ! !	164.85397
and the 100 , 000 subscribers became a reality .	543.4994
and now a million january guideposts are in circulation .	1769.5782
with our growth came expansion into new fields of service .	458.05417
today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .	1122.935
they say all personnel have spiritual needs which guideposts helps to meet .	34893.848
hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land .	458.72476
they say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built .	412.94662
thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the armed forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere .	722.83154
bedridden people say i am easy to hold -- and read .	229.91853

we prayed for john , during surgery , we asked others to pray	856.19543
all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .	1011.9079
perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .	1007.7235
but , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it .	471.80292
that is the kind of people they are .	105.79768
perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ?	1089.7087
serious , yes , but also much laughter .	398.64926
sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate .	230.65833
there are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea .	289.38016
and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .	1944.9597
a good word for it is fellowship .	77.71867
each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group .	478.64035
it takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help guideposts ' readers .	331.14743
for you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is guideposts .	349.27692
i need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers .	455.73434
my message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in god .	133.23991
havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men ' s eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices .	191.01349
the hated dictator batista had fled .	433.46796
rumors flew from lip to lip that fidel castro was on his way to havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought batista for five years .	558.0529
already the city was filled with barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the prado .	3954.189
and then castro himself did come , bearded , smiling	2388.441
yet if you looked closely you ' d see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .	412.2116
at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .	351.54227
i am sure that castro was happy , too , about that support .	652.20044
diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny .	772.61676
my grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .	2797.8098
my own earliest memories are of exiles my three brothers and i were taken often to the united states `` to visit relatives ' ' while my father stayed on to fight the dictator machado .	766.4843
when it was my turn , i , too , printed the truth as i knew it about batista , and rejoiced to see his regime topple .	1158.6179
none of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead .	578.58954
i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana .	1359.7633
within a week , however , i began to suspect that something was wrong .	285.47018
for castro was bringing cuba not freedom , but hatred .	696.6993
he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge .	2482.0798
he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras .	4667.169
on home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall .	819.1012
he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .	4469.276
new schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation any academic degree earned during batista ' s regime was invalid .	844.71185
he had promised cheaper housing arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room .	1955.2386
under another law , hundreds of farms were seized .	1650.0663
farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .	940.6476
of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in `` people ' s stores ' ' .	537.51636
a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist .	1191.9069
in my mind , i began to review his use of hate to gain support	686.08307
his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain .	229.70123
but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace	243.76051
what should i do about it , i asked myself ? ?	114.90567
i had watched castro handling his enemies before the paredon .	1469.8573
there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting `` paredon ! !	904.2066
i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario now the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors	11220.766
the thump and whir of our new presses .	233.16891
here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if i told it to .	243.42227
then one day , early in january , 1960 , i sat down at my desk , and suddenly i was aware of the crucifix .	279.74548
it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .	2056.4492
i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner .	550.51697
now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness in his eyes , saying	656.1064
`` you will lose the paper .	89.494255
but do you have any choice ' ' ? ?	47.08006
i knew in that moment that i did not have any choice .	250.68855
from that day on i began to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in fidel castro ' s regime .	399.92624
too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don ' t want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things ' ' because `` you ' ll stunt your growth ' ' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` hey lookit mr . america	1657.0088
whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) ' ' ? ?	125.04108
after all , a guy ' s gotta have a little ego ! !	924.0052
therefore it ' s a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! !	832.80396
this happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new junior mr . canada -- henri de courcy .	2417.6128
far from discouraging henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .	689.25195
instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority , professor roland claude .	2546.6511
and they couldn ' t have entrusted henri to better hands because `` le professeur ' ' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth .	1473.4193
that ' s because the good professor teaches only weider methods at his famous montreal health studio which is located at 1821 mt . royal east in montreal .	2887.4172
undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) .	916.3071
there ' s gaetan d ' amours who is our newest mr . canada	336.10428
jean-paul senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago	3178.6528
jack boissoneault , who was with us last month	377.7987
charles harve , who recently won the `` most muscular man ' ' subdivision award in the mr . canada event	620.58356
yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! !	431.88177
now when henri was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 ' ' ' ' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .	783.93585
about that time he began reading mr . america and muscle builder and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining .	800.24994
seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of quick-wate and super-protein , those two wonder-working weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .	975.3569
well , sir they did real great ! !	2614.1526
for in almost less time than it takes to tell it , henri ' s bodyweight was increasing rapidly .	563.9683
of course he did some exercising .	1333.1357
he ' s crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame .	2373.482
henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn ' t have to work them very much .	738.67316
but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .	761.25494
it was muscular but it wasn ' t symmetrical .	231.76457
`` a real ' nothing ' torso ' ' , says henri .	5620.2017
`` it never seemed to widen .	789.7039
it just got longer and longer ' ' .	38.876774
that ' s when he went to professor claude .	363.40552
and at once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .	338.4538
in his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out ' ' equipment since vic tanny .	596.3622
mr . claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous weider push-pull super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set is a pressing or `` pushing ' ' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling ' ' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .	789.00714
so right away claude introduced henri to his famous `` moon ' ' bench and proceeded to teach him his first push-pull super-set consisting of the wide-grip straight-arm pullover ( the `` pull ' ' part of the push-pull super-set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar bench press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , reeves-type `` gladiator ' ' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids .	2083.9417
as you can see , in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! !	2176.8616
now when henri has completed four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete push-pull super-sets no . 2 .	2842.6182
super-set no . 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon ' ' and flat benches .	491.34448
the `` push ' ' exercise of this push-pull super-set is the bench press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .	1047.3337
you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs .	647.3521
the dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the aj .	1247.9603
the `` pull ' ' exercise in this super-set is the one-dumbbell bent-arm pullover .	4620.6895
( note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) .	2019.8207
in the third push-pull super-set the `` push ' ' exercise is the widegrip pushup between bars , while the `` pull ' ' exercise is the moon bench lateral raise with bent arms .	1376.9634
the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! !	3630.6235
this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .	613.5548
you ' ll know when you ' ve made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ! !	1011.2384
as you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip .	787.1189
he just can ' t do anything about it at all ! !	102.20512
but as you can also see , it ' s not a painful exercise at all , because henri de courcy -- the `` happy ' ' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! !	255.27422
the last exercise of roland claude ' s prescribed program for henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets .	2633.579
by this time henri ' s entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work .	3685.6038
he has henri do from four to six sets of the incline bench press ( note the high incline ) .	996.90686
this gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and aj .	2594.6714
this is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests	18610.176
that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock ' ' looks of the great champions .	246.14961
so with four complete push-pull super-sets no . 1 , four of no . 2 , four of no . 3 and four to six sets of the incline bench press , you can see that henri de courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon .	948.04645
physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .	1180.3744
rarer still is a mr . america or mr . universe of true herculean build .	557.76
the aspects of physical development that catch the judges ' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles .	890.7712
now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts .	1940.8972
but contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor ' s chisel -- is something quite different .	655.1516
this comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .	1283.5321
often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .	3018.0361
because they are `` minority ' ' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten .	810.39343
only when the newest mr . america or mr . universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are .	849.8181
the exercise i shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the one leg lunge .	643.96246
why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! !	1244.6454
it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders	1767.454
a criterion of muscle `` drama ' ' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike	694.4018
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .	4768.462
definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which is easily understandable .	2231.4136
the one leg lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .	1059.9528
but for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular squatting , leg curling , leg extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed .	2424.631
indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .	865.5587
used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ! !	1451.3336
really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective 1 .	488.59015
it ' s a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise .	22336.791
it places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .	1478.2314
it improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make squats more easily and more correctly performed .	816.29266
it increases flexibility of the legs .	106.02439
it speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each .	788.27277
you ' ll need your weider power stands for this fine exercise and here ' s the way it ' s done 1 .	346.53482
place your power stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean .	1026.7037
place a suitably-loaded barbell across them	1013.4265
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck )	246.43135
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .	799.7956
now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet .	1237.0353
when the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the power stands .	609.3168
after you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .	531.3468
that ' s the one-leg lunge in a nutshell .	21481.553
you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety .	716.4869
you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise .	1514.9305
oh , you ' ll wobble and weave quite a bit at first .	1516.4613
before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you ' ll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ! !	539.1687
although i suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there ' s no reason why you shouldn ' t make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .	201.95009
squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front .	1285.6484
the most beautiful bed of pansies i ' ve seen was in a south dakota yard on a sizzling day .	371.55518
pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .	1660.8121
i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .	942.7666
he seemed puzzled by my question .	168.68213
`` i just love them ' ' , he said .	25.136349
the more i talked with him , the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming .	320.49432
of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .	1527.306
he planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist .	912.22485
these specialists , i learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers .	260.47617
their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .	1233.4783
i asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .	315.49875
occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did	331.49957
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down ' ' .	156.47026
it ' s best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .	359.6634
his soil was `` nothing special ' ' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown-black .	649.6454
i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .	2706.763
it isn ' t easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .	990.5545
nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .	781.51874
they germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily .	1206.1637
it doesn ' t really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours .	630.39417
i like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames .	608.1189
pansies don ' t have to be coddled	638.32556
they ' d rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .	3102.8262
if you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .	777.0411
for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .	1631.7697
i dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .	2420.552
then i cover the sowing with a board .	1695.7166
this keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .	1309.3351
ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .	1082.9137
when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board .	555.2595
a light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth .	1457.5991
i like sawdust for this , or hay .	201.0217
when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it ' s time to set them out where they are to remain .	269.91995
every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .	2659.0571
the moral is don ' t transplant it any oftener than you must .	1307.9816
as soon as they are large enough to move , i put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom .	993.65405
i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .	4593.304
that encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .	349.2947
i doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .	442.78903
i spade lots of compost into their bed	2237.5688
lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine .	703.74963
one year i simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and i had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors ' experience .	249.02084
in addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .	7997.6665
as a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .	470.39783
we put a light mulch over the seedlings	6759.309
now we must use a heavy one .	329.87482
three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .	1193.699
when winter comes be ready with additional mulch .	985.8372
i like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost .	492.97763
that keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .	6140.3745
don ' t miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .	212.26678
whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you ' ll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .	373.40414
if those aren ' t enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ?	390.73926
the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february during a particularly cold winter .	820.43536
i started the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .	332.94577
( an unheated greenhouse would have been better , if i had had one .	86.40825
) the plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them .	649.37775
in response to the lengthening days of february they budded , then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers .	4095.664
that cold frame was my morale builder	20010.773
its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it .	826.22723
like strawberries in december , pansies are far more exciting in february than in may .	423.53815
try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can ' t take another day of it .	340.69333
the day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy ' ' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .	924.785
try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there .	701.7816
pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season .	566.58374
as soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant .	2006.7721
a second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch .	1185.7047
these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .	1098.9286
i like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming .	651.50323
probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed .	356.0603
nature ' s aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation .	266.67178
that done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .	430.36752
here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .	1189.5851
go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .	3910.649
it is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things	2137.6938
but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .	638.51587
many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .	715.54144
if the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first .	569.13824
would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ?	783.7575
remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds .	597.2822
they stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it .	2324.6863
treat them right and they ' ll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .	360.80588
give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they ' ll repay your solicitude with beauty .	709.85223
a salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .	1115.5732
this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the united states .	493.1763
it has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven ' t made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should .	471.13095
you will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .	1524.8384
it is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe bartlett pear , but oily .	2766.467
the avocado should have a `` give ' ' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .	101.42633
the flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange	2210.3977
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like .	12519.448
it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .	188.0073
sometimes it takes several `` eatings ' ' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world .	608.8312
once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation .	804.97534
today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world .	352.56714
the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point .	138.7528
it is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior .	1261.8553
the fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-f . , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state .	1237.9463
this cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .	807.2748
this happens on the grocer ' s shelf or in your kitchen .	833.30286
one of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .	612.4972
there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .	18146.021
if the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed .	2892.4292
and unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado .	172.81277
it is thick , much like an egg plant ' s skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .	631.71515
good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .	1334.2683
avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients .	1877.6682
their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system .	775.79456
aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins a and c -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin e requirement .	738.07605
the b vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .	2191.885
calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts .	1359.5093
none of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .	1608.5464
dr . wilson c . grant , of the veterans ' administration hospital , coral gables , florida , and the university of miami school of medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .	586.5378
the study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .	1167.3533
they were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood .	766.791
then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .	1189.2136
five , four , three , two , one , fire ! !	176.04156
the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .	745.72046
the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach .	1520.6401
never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear .	756.51416
nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying .	2082.4685
a great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets .	2380.0017
it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent ' s cities and people .	411.0677
with a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim ' s people ? ?	591.13947
wouldn ' t the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?	803.577
the nation would be utterly devastated .	3090.6526
the will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken .	437.5592
nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days	631.0161
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .	348.30014
at this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being `` soft ' ' , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons .	347.59714
however , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent ' s cities , at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal .	487.185
it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic .	3452.4587
icbms have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways .	279.0069
they could be used to attack a nation ' s people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker ' s own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy ' s military force .	139.44513
if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles .	624.08075
we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .	647.6933
we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile .	367.2375
missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations .	444.55936
because of a missile ' s ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately .	490.5048
placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons .	969.8944
one must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .	774.23615
even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously , the icbm still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes .	521.6534
therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered .	1586.0651
because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability .	2276.2424
in order to destroy the enemy ' s mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles .	477.48526
until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .	399.0047
it seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other ' s citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us .	812.8455
let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm force .	7721.671
it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the b-52 or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based missiles .	1954.0253
if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons .	939.96515
an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of russia -- provided that we had used some of our icbms to degrade russia ' s air defenses before our bombers got there .	1120.3118
the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .	666.48236
why , then , aren ' t we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ?	819.2324
is there any other way to do the job ? ?	86.187065
survivability of our strategic forces ( polaris , mobile and hardened minuteman , hardened atlas and titan , and airborne skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force .	904.6883
war , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation .	626.33844
forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict .	292.67935
the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed .	242.21417
even mobile forces must be found and destroyed .	141.96367
but , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ?	352.1938
they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile .	1483.3555
some day , many years in the future , true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets .	299.87573
but until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft .	475.87894
however , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft ' ' airfields .	406.39853
nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease .	1145.8264
here then is our problem aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing	904.83325
but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile .	360.3308
this makes today ' s aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon .	752.25653
aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .	284.0247
this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .	220.23051
but remember this -- it isn ' t the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield .	145.68333
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles .	1991.6063
there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground	637.68274
put aircraft in `` bomb-proof ' ' hangars when they are on the ground .	348.3988
build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3 , 000-foot ) airfields with runways .	1694.706
if we could use all the small airfields we have in this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more .	422.7569
use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .	388.78836
using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( vtol ) long-range military aircraft .	3843.5303
we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 aj .	519.54803
we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .	378.54486
large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3 , 000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today .	553.70593
there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile .	596.8842
this same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft .	891.72485
one seldom hears the analogy `` nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine ' ' .	336.9162
if , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one .	631.70825
with powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built .	2159.9343
for example , a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter .	14817.261
with a 15-to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300 , 000 pounds could rise vertically .	2007.0459
the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don ' t spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete .	683.64526
when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to aj .	1180.3507
if our sac bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance .	1329.7378
we would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy ' s force -- whether it were fixed or mobile .	339.81653
with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating .	473.58624
no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy ' s military force .	886.3254
our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance .	749.272
in a few years we will have samos ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .	1446.2628
but in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ? ?	400.3658
what targets have we successfully knocked out ? ?	765.3883
a ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful .	753.1711
what targets still remain to be hit ? ?	67.72811
these crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .	1245.1625
samos will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark .	230.86342
even if this is some day possible , there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target .	1016.38245
if the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced .	561.85754
pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably .	1441.6099
it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .	1011.11115
it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .	922.02856
it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the united states with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone .	361.03146
a large aircraft , such as the b-52 or b-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons .	760.01373
few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1 , 000 psi overpressure at 100 feet .	2061.8347
or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in hiroshima and nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! !	1257.5803
it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons .	1339.3608
today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc . .	1704.9316
with these keen `` eyes ' ' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas .	768.18677
if we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy ' s military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening .	467.33133
the lyric beauties of schubert ' s trout quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners .	1285.7478
but for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems .	1645.4087
since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic .	639.13635
moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .	1198.8093
the many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .	442.1495
some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .	2706.8687
other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .	1383.5997
in these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown ' s attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .	621.675
recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer than ten different performances .	567.7101
the occasion for this marathon angel ' s long-awaited reissue in its `` great recordings of the century ' ' series of the schnabel-pro arte version .	3186.894
let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first .	502.2105
whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , colh 40 is a document of prime importance .	861.008
artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .	483.8397
but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to are by schnabel pupils ( clifford curzon , frank glazer , adrian aeschbacher , and victor babin ) also sheds light on the master ' s pedagogical skills .	834.631
certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` schnabel trill ' ' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .	1007.9648
but the most impressive testimony to schnabel ' s distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student ' s approach as distinctly his own .	458.5649
schnabel ' s emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .	2179.2336
yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .	552.4195
this is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .	426.9595
and although schnabel ' s pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to schubert ' s dynamic markings and phrase indications .	757.55707
the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .	1261.871
about the pro arte ' s contribution i am less happy .	223.15434
i , for one , rather regret that schnabel didn ' t collaborate with the budapest quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist ' s interpretative outlook than the style of the belgian group .	756.8941
from a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the pro arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .	404.5272
the violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .	1624.8276
the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .	536.639
there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` forellen ' ' movement , and i suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original aj .	654.4659
turning to the more modern versions , curzon ' s ( london ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .	838.40924
every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these i would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .	1616.1471
some of curzon ' s playing strikes me as finicky , however .	1469.163
why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? ?	259.9129
the assisting musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .	2040.0496
( special compliments to the double bass playing of johann krumpp his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance .	5817.7773
the glazer-fine arts edition ( concert-disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .	639.3631
it is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .	587.97095
but having lived with the disc for some time now , i find the performance less exciting than either schnabel ' s or fleisher ' s ( whose superb performance with the budapest quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon ' s .	493.00443
aeschbacher ' s work is very much akin to schnabel ' s , but the sound on his decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it .	388.57837
the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet ( angel ) and victor babin-festival quartet ( rca victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .	4008.5293
( babin has acquired some of schnabel ' s keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight .	484.8184
) badura-skoda-vienna konzerthaus ( westminster ) and demus-schubert quartet ( deutsche grammophon ) are both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .	4980.714
helmut roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists .	648.5181
telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2 . 98 ) is worthy of consideration .	1223.7981
returning once again to the schnabel reissue , i am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist ' s musical penetration .	801.61646
here is truly a `` great recording of the century ' ' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .	201.16814
this recording surely belongs in everyone ' s collection .	132.26054
must records always sound like records ? ?	248.39491
from the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation .	2171.3752
seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones .	793.72296
although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .	432.0066
on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of parsifal under karl muck ' s baton , or sense the type of ensemble toscanini created in his years with the new york philharmonic .	768.2048
since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .	3557.187
in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer .	1260.3375
other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .	4854.9863
if we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing .	1021.97614
records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .	500.12186
this difference is made up of many factors .	161.63542
some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .	475.00748
( music often sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat .	712.6407
) from the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original .	720.68604
any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .	502.4134
yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .	1046.788
the sound may be good	959.74963
but if you know the real thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation .	206.50677
command ' s new brahms second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .	575.6722
like the recent scheherazade from london ( high fidelity , sept . 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .	1301.6223
because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers ' triumph .	401.9888
the easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .	1208.3551
the engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .	3890.2683
the effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .	426.17136
this absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .	5131.1943
a contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .	395.22342
the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .	6083.2886
yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .	882.29834
command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .	4370.8525
the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority	2682.7944
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .	7908.0273
the timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .	1224.2042
all of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction .	283.57285
for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .	238.81038
steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what brahms set down on paper .	902.4392
those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .	299.5792
without losing the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect .	1583.9194
the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real allegro con spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .	762.669
in the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .	244.73451
steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .	332.80847
the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .	227.62381
too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .	560.08777
the command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .	146.71529
your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .	782.70544
it is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .	416.78632
the first substantially complete stereo giselle ( and the only one of its scope since feyer ' s four-sided lp edition of 1958 for angel ) , this set is , i ' m afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .	885.48175
the already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari ' s melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .	6275.5786
and in its engineers ' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super-high fidelity ' ' .	1086.8666
the home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .	787.23865
as with the penultimate giselle release ( wolff ' s abridgment for rca victor ) i find the cleaner , less razor-edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my sd copies .	2398.371
at the westminster kc dog show in madison square garden , new york on the second day , the finals of the junior class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class .	320.19202
the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far south as kentucky .	816.7046
this year several entries from canada were entered which made the junior class international .	646.41876
forty-six of the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present .	1408.8658
it was interesting to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class .	358.7089
as has been the custom for the past several years , john cross , jr . , bench show chmn . of westminster , arranged for the juniors ' meeting before the class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them .	631.6824
over 60 juniors , parents and guests attended .	1116.8453
mrs . william h . long , jr . speaks	347.06152
after the juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the finals of the junior class , mrs . william h . long , jr . was introduced as the first speaker .	345.07275
in her opening remarks mrs . long also welcomed the juniors and stated , `` there isn ' t any other show quite like westminster .	676.4094
i know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break .	3168.2178
mrs . long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years .	471.41812
twenty years ago her daughter betsey long , then 13 years of age , won the grand challenge trophy , children ' s handling class ( as they were called then ) at westminster .	1095.4745
no sooner had betsey come out of the ring than mrs . long walked into the working competition with ch . cadet or noranda , another home-bred product , and won ! !	1012.74255
speaking from long years of experience , mrs . long advised the juniors `` when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ! !	555.3766
dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ! !	883.7616
when you and your dog step into the junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do .	228.93526
if you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! !	210.84842
he knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers ' ' .	303.61118
`` take away your attitude ' ' , said mrs . long , `` and what have you left ? ?	107.48005
either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ! !	920.15845
or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the class , or you are just doing this to please the parents .	290.46872
`` the reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce .	368.44302
aids sounds more like a pony club , or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ! !	1136.9897
`` your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be	546.08203
legs to produce motion and rate of speed .	134.44241
without right attitude the other aids just do not work right ' ' .	188.57373
mrs . long wished all the juniors luck in the class and stated , `` have fun ! !	313.97214
and may you all continue to show at westminster in the years to come ' ' ! !	70.77344
the second speaker was harvey barcus , president of the dog writers ass ' n of america .	647.4772
mr . barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for juniors -- with which he is very familiar .	492.76773
last year a boy he knows and helped in journalism won the thoroughbred racing ass ' n scholarship which is worth $10 , 000 .	1152.7595
he gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship .	350.14084
`` junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged ' ' ! !	328.00375
is one of mr . barcus ' strong beliefs .	305.1946
he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should take a more active part in encouraging the junior division ! !	518.4482
in closing , mr . barcus also wished all the juniors luck in their class .	281.35532
instead of 3 a . m . in the past , the juniors class at westminster was held at 4 45 p . m . .	116.13968
this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! !	176.50427
before the juniors entered the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs .	595.22864
from there on , each junior was going to be judged individually .	429.6927
this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the class .	597.40845
this year anne hone rogers , outstanding handler , judged the class .	1018.0632
this is the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at westminster that a lady handler has judged the class .	818.2572
as the juniors entered the ring , mr . spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that westminster has held the finals of the junior competition .	470.93484
juniors competed last year at american kennel club and canadian kennel club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this class -- the finals for the year .	600.7292
a junior who won two or more wins in the open class was eligible .	579.09796
( the purpose of the junior showmanship competition is to teach and encourage juniors to become good sportsmen .	963.4197
many adults showing at westminster today are products of this class .	245.82915
it seemed an almost impossible job for miss rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 juniors entered .	1710.518
a large number of these juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners .	2221.8677
after the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring .	226.60754
she then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship .	1330.7039
betty lou ham , age 16 , holyoke , mass . , showing an irish setter , was chosen as international champion of the year .	604.4018
she was awarded the professional handlers ' ass ' ns ' leonard brumby , sr . memorial trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the junior classes .	3280.0486
betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year .	310.17035
in addition to showing an irish setter throughout the year , she also scored with an afghan .	826.1382
sydney le blanc , age 15 , staten island , n . y . , showing a doberman pinscher , was 2nd .	655.1853
susan hackmann , age 14 , from baltimore , md . , showing a dachshund , was 3rd .	619.0865
last year susan also placed 3rd in the finals at westminster .	1019.9124
from the records we keep -- susan is the only junior who has placed in the junior classes in both united states and canada .	243.2379
karen marcmann , age 16 , trapp , penna . , showing a keeshond was 4th .	1893.6406
most juniors who were entered in the finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in junior classes but score in the breed classes as well .	902.60925
in 1960 , there were 7287 entries in the junior classes .	913.57947
each year these shows have increased in entries .	468.98102
next year 1962 , at westminster , the bench show committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more junior classes in the open division only to qualify for westminster .	507.40356
percy roberts , a leading judge will not be at the international show this year for the junior judging contest as he has been invited to judge in australia in march .	411.61667
it has been suggested many times that a class be set up for the juniors who are overage and cannot enter the junior classes .	610.47394
for some time this writer has been suggesting a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the junior class .	799.66864
such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester kc show recently .	2020.9932
not only were the contestants pleased with the class , but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day .	458.8919
the intermediates in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the judge .	443.67267
we suggested this class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows .	276.7487
at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated that this intermediate judging class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world .	641.6189
this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .	252.30403
last year robert harris , a leading junior handler entered the dog judging contest ( junior ) at the international kc of chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any junior since the class ' inception .	839.38055
juniors who attend this chicago show should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help to them .	266.4003
superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed handler to judge junior showmanship competition .	1405.9847
the founder of the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby , sr . ( for whom the trophy is named after at westminster ) was an outstanding handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division .	798.5929
some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a junior ' s ability to show a dog .	377.17032
to overcome this unfair judging , the a . k . c . requires that a licensed handler be present to judge the class .	258.7187
if the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from handlers , it has been suggested that licensed judges also be qualified to judge this class .	754.7685
by recognizing and helping juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners .	592.34796
the airedale terrier club of america and the kerry blue terrier club of america have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in junior showmanship competition at any show .	2683.845
the kansas city and the topeka kcs are arranging that juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for westminster .	1810.5797
the rio grande kc is also considering having their junior classes set up so that juniors can qualify with points for westminster .	1209.3784
the american pointer club is still continuing to donate trophies to juniors who win at junior showmanship classes with pointers .	3276.722
traveling through the south -- over 16 , 000 miles -- with two great danes , an afghan , and a persian kitten , we ' ve worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels .	682.0472
my husband enters the motel office , signs up for a room , and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets .	1134.1794
`` no ' ' , he replies , `` full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained ' ' .	1044.7151
once settled , we ' re careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can ' t do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture .	293.94666
in the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ! !	622.5462
many a motel owner -- when we ' ve stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children .	399.65952
so many times i have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination .	3513.6763
is it that they don ' t care ? ?	21.675499
are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient ? ?	352.61237
at one time , to most americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the united states navy .	589.2977
today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport .	2294.868
there are more than 8 , 000 , 000 recreational boats in use in the united states with almost 10 , 000 , 000 the prediction for within the next decade .	276.5962
about 40 , 000 , 000 people participated in boating in 1960 .	387.13043
boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .	2101.9944
boats are operated in every state in the union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the middle west .	443.9829
the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation ' s coastline .	759.0026
but during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock .	1285.7932
developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country .	1211.0098
no matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile lake texoma , located between texas and oklahoma , which resulted when the corp of army engineers dammed the red river .	989.63007
in 1959 , according to the engineers , lake texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1 , 000 , 000 persons .	795.2379
where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water .	315.7222
providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1 , 800 , 000 boat trailers now in use .	1200.4774
it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2 , 000 .	911.6813
the sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace .	4414.28
boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year- ' round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat .	795.8043
today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door .	234.0497
arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun .	426.7735
and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .	253.84857
this year , americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation ' s national , regional and local boat shows .	774.1841
the boats of america ' s trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons .	692.8592
the variety of craft on the country ' s waters today is overwhelming .	187.12346
they range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100 , 000 .	2199.0103
boat prices vary according to the buyer ' s desires or needs .	172.06273
in this respect , boats can be compared with houses .	361.99542
there is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget .	254.93546
there is no question as to just what is available .	184.4445
you name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models .	251.69734
there are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips .	1773.5503
there are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience .	2331.7427
you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond .	1238.9208
you may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal .	633.9715
you may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks .	1160.7745
you may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .	571.4988
designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat .	1588.9249
you pay your money and you take your choice .	234.71054
american technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in american boating .	851.7284
i wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , americans excel over any country in the world in the long run .	570.4432
russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance .	360.67532
now here is truly a marvel .	520.9325
the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .	724.1805
these engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .	1527.5157
their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook , the range being about $150 to $1 , 000 , depending on size .	407.60098
great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country	463.6229
and to making the owning of a boat simpler .	1200.7075
there was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel .	359.7236
having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended .	423.18384
marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later .	5649.532
terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles .	504.59796
of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser ' s earning power , credit rating and local bank policy .	1409.5553
outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats .	335.9735
terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .	1785.256
when the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go .	985.1108
when air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all .	425.26804
man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft .	2248.4043
it was much the same with pleasure boating at first .	1497.5674
come one , come all , the water ' s fine ! !	93.07728
as the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do	516.86206
however , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating .	1053.1896
laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower .	136.47748
what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .	377.37683
the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used .	172.22304
if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the u . s . coast guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on federal waterways .	426.73096
state numbering laws differ from each other in many ways .	297.52322
fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such as sailboats with no power , to be registered at all .	366.35843
many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators .	1046.6228
generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities .	1263.2153
it is always wise to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are .	1034.2921
ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land	291.83038
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .	476.71494
hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry ' s self originated and directed safety program .	344.36823
foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 .	446.64078
a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers .	166.52718
the industry has been its own watch dog .	1275.1058
with u . s . coast guard cooperation , the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety .	687.40936
industry interest in safety goes even farther .	2725.1877
in 1959 , the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment .	1083.362
a new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at atlantic city , new jersey , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe .	625.9368
in addition to these activities , the naebm , with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue , new york city , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat .	734.9791
it is important to note the work of the united states power squadrons and the u . s . coast guard auxiliary .	189.62918
each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .	4573.4204
these are not governmentally subsidized organizations .	2022.7834
this year , over 100 , 000 persons will receive this free instruction .	300.4133
as america on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .	1133.355
instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas .	353.5854
the word marina was coined by naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort .	2463.9036
currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general store , and a grocery store .	1034.233
yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services .	1359.7277
boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel .	1799.6749
it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards .	1237.9741
regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas .	11817.531
boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .	704.779
a recent survey disclosed there are about 4 , 000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the united states , the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats .	452.74527
the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .	587.0823
in the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves .	831.94745
the main set of bars are the `` tappets ' ' and one tappet is connected to each lever .	240.35974
if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .	606.5646
close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .	216.71257
these can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .	840.8932
the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .	1381.5369
in the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called `` dogs ' ' .	666.57263
two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .	723.8086
these slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them .	683.346
here ' s how the scheme works suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .	1721.6432
this also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars .	577.01416
the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets .	1215.6846
by this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal .	2095.1628
interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red ' ' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear ' ' the signal .	229.7146
this is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant ' ' .	276.3528
a turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points .	347.59085
a signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked .	1858.2384
such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face ' ' oncoming traffic .	796.0757
the lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point .	838.38965
if the points aren ' t thrown all the way , the turnout cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be cleared .	130.65315
generally , these locks on turnouts are called `` facing point locks ' ' .	921.6096
figs . 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals .	1177.1392
each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart ' ' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled .	706.2778
the lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars .	3105.2979
by studying the track-signal diagrams you ' ll note several other details .	736.11975
derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a `` stop ' ' signal -- are used in many instances .	1148.1115
`` home ' ' signals have two blades .	2277.4944
the blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move .	366.86295
as an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant ' ' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant .	349.76773
in some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution .	417.38895
in other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects .	734.3815
the interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on paul larson ' s railroad follows the fig . 1 scheme and is shown beginning in fig . 7 , page 65 , and in the photos .	492.0042
here ' s how it can be built .	82.82721
the sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig . 7 , most of the bars being 1/8 ' ' ' ' brass in 1/4 ' ' ' ' and 1/2 ' ' ' ' widths .	129.7218
you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish .	757.1038
our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction .	235.66681
when cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk .	1225.5173
start with the right-hand piece `` b ' ' , af , soldering it to the lower piece `` a ' ' of the same material but 12 ' ' ' ' long .	174.96043
let exactly 1 ' ' ' ' of `` a ' ' extend beyond `` b ' ' and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees .	263.83945
now lay 12 pieces of af cut 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . .	347.97476
this gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece `` b ' ' .	572.1916
compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` b ' ' .	90.32254
solder this second `` b ' ' to `` a ' ' at right angles .	101.04667
there should be 10 ' ' ' ' between the two parallel members and each should be 1 ' ' ' ' from an end of the long piece .	139.0146
cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a af bar .	519.2124
tack-solder all the 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . pieces to the 10 ' ' ' ' and 12 ' ' ' ' members .	92.88875
these will be drilled and tapped later on .	664.86163
now cut five af locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) .	2870.8467
position these using six intermediate temporary af spacers and locate the upper 12 ' ' ' ' bar `` a ' ' .	404.8703
solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame .	1127.1173
now place 12 pieces 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4 ' ' ' ' long `` tappets ' ' , as they are called .	175.10358
cap with a af bar and tack-solder in place .	712.95374
cap the locking bar spacers with two af directly under the first two `` b ' ' pieces .	283.869
remove all the loose spacing bars .	4208.297
mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together .	766.14813
placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8 ' ' ' ' from any edge .	137.07953
drill all no . 50 and counter-drill all except the `` a ' ' pieces size 43 .	1222.4176
tap the `` a ' ' pieces 2-56 .	459.67813
now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12 ' ' ' ' and the first two 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' bars ( `` a ' ' and `` b ' ' pieces ) , which are soldered together .	179.89378
either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions .	499.4446
dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs .	4630.1772
drill 20 no . 47 holes in the upper piece `` a ' ' as shown in fig . 7 .	180.99133
tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on .	1542.1685
note , 6 and 8 lock levers don ' t require holes for contacts .	1243.1692
now reassemble the frame , using af roundhead steel screws and nuts .	1872.5834
put the 12 tappets and some af locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws .	916.707
be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2 ' ' ' ' sq . spacer .	398.6173
as an anchor for the spring lock , insert a af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in fig . 7 .	247.158
drill a no . 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw .	1125.2915
drill two no . 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 .	752.04456
number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots .	431.08102
remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth .	475.78134
cut five pieces of af brass bar stock 3-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	856.5707
these are supporting members for the short locking bars .	304.8781
locate their positions in fig . 7 and drill no . 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame .	321.92764
cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut .	1598.3271
drill four no . 19 and four no . 28 holes in the 12 ' ' ' ' long `` a ' ' pieces .	208.86938
locate the position from fig . 7 .	27.880257
draw-file no . 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends .	733.89667
break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer .	2269.1086
drill a no . 50 hole 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' from one end and tap 2-56 .	476.26688
) put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar .	704.69324
to find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge .	990.3712
scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1/4 ' ' ' ' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64 ' ' ' ' ) away from the frame edge .	279.67905
total distance is about 21/64 ' ' ' ' .	170.08505
tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4 ' ' ' ' tappet movement .	964.7165
drill a no . 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end .	1095.347
drill a no . 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in figs . 7 and 8 .	1126.8943
repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars .	471.62253
to each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs . 6 and 8 .	688.3231
these will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts .	1778.8362
fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times .	1437.0464
as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible .	708.6276
a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished .	779.0475
each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting .	1256.4373
the order of fitting is not too important .	317.56866
however , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back .	344.67776
since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar .	465.18185
figs . 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions .	1901.2734
all the bars are cut from af brass .	1629.4519
the lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of fig . 7 .	151.83571
bar `` c ' ' is 2-3/4 ' ' ' ' long .	135.45331
draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame .	427.0642
fig . 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes .	1604.2675
center-punch and drill the no . 31 hole 7/16 ' ' ' ' from one end of the bar .	197.83977
chuck a length of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8 ' ' ' ' long .	573.83484
cut the piece about 9/32 ' ' ' ' or 5/16 ' ' ' ' long and drive it into the no . 31 hole drilled in the locking bar .	413.88812
file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8 ' ' ' ' above the bar .	300.32837
this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 .	809.46106
place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 .	714.8212
scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` a ' ' .	245.76408
see the drawings for the shape of the notch .	115.94453
scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool .	740.3375
we used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about	2537.0713
' ' thick and 1 ' ' ' ' dia . fitted on a 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . mandrel .	223.68607
such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts .	1402.9784
a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one .	2045.0315
endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible .	1264.5068
the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it .	2096.709
assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces .	335.2604
all matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis .	743.484
chuck a 2 ' ' ' ' or 3 ' ' ' ' piece of 1/8 ' ' ' ' dia . drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool .	260.87595
fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64 ' ' ' ' long on one end , using swiss pattern files .	812.5145
this tool can also be made with a lathe .	414.80545
scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics .	347.16895
without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go ' round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn .	509.17722
math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .	318.7763
it ' s not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science .	759.2651
but because science is based on mathematics doesn ' t mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician .	544.9656
a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems	4613.895
however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding .	364.65164
a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .	485.68243
it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .	317.34598
the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula .	328.3084
this changes the formula to an `` equation ' ' .	78.01564
the equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .	174.47348
equations for rodding formulas are not complicated .	423.20364
they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes .	2886.316
however , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order .	543.6982
they indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .	253.60213
the symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .	823.66724
the lower number is always divided into the upper number af	893.1142
the symbol for multiplication is `` **b ' ' .	164.63841
it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row .	335.8931
numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .	461.50717
the result will be the same regardless of the order used .	194.69437
the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .	912.2566
this is nothing more than a dash .	257.50772
it separates two or more numbers .	285.52505
the number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol .	161.48868
when more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct .	515.73724
for example , for the problem af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 .	703.9299
addition is indicated by the + symbol .	35328.137
the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers .	284.59775
numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .	269.34872
when solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value .	618.1644
multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right .	260.0675
completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps af .	1102.7794
this would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 .	831.14966
this part of the equation would then become 4 .	661.6077
for use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents .	601.09454
the easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .	401.14874
charts for this purpose are available from many sources .	263.5598
they are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments .	1098.9767
the various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .	468.4701
shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result .	210.8617
some formulas contain `` constants ' ' .	192.32217
a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation .	292.64154
it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .	1510.0437
rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .	242.03766
the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .	1295.4972
when it is needed , one formula is as important as another .	303.75208
however , some formulas are used more than others .	311.9645
we ' ll take them in the general order of their popularity .	130.6739
a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine .	263.3441
displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume ' ' .	72.89212
most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions .	3900.5474
it is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed .	1524.84
factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine ' s cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant .	251.52348
the constant is , which is one-quarter of 3 . 1416 , another constant known as `` pi ' ' .	719.89435
pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles .	1125.5018
actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine .	414.47232
the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders .	199.839
multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine ' s total displacement .	229.98816
dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .	483.75754
dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) .	409.57483
one inch equals 2 . 54 centimeters one cubic inch equals 16 . 38 cubic centimeters .	4056.1829
for example , let ' s consider a standard 283 cubic inch chevy aj .	6062.9307
these engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches .	1408.9061
the formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes af .	3429.3376
to arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right .	214.9851
the different steps will look like this af	675.5684
a cylinder ' s compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder ' s volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber .	331.99615
cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .	1425.7028
cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula af .	445.32272
to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level .	537.7289
then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface .	1196.0201
this is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .	537.4559
such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber .	282.31607
the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity .	547.8783
most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc . ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches .	511.91284
however , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .	300.80145
the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used .	617.6706
the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .	259.88638
the volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket ' s thickness in thousandths of an inch .	921.448
sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won ' t affect the final computation .	518.38226
the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume .	947.6306
another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position .	231.30486
compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth .	571.79614
the formula for this step is af .	228.25421
this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening .	426.31934
the total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume ' ' .	395.11676
after the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula af	416.4353
for an example let ' s dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches .	540.22156
applying these figures to the formula we get the equation af .	286.43134
the compression ratio is 10 to 1 .	190.6949
this method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads .	5617.0938
any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed .	1034.9069
the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position .	989.2149
there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size .	1104.8005
by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three .	313.92545
to simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors .	321.39236
tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .	494.43036
this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft .	377.8185
a tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made .	639.8374
the measurement must be in inches .	675.0001
any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics .	595.5335
when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula .	358.2776
to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is af .	386.11835
for an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4 . 00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this af	437.61533
to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is af .	277.8895
using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes af	303.17456
to determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is af .	362.90192
using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes af .	299.23267
-- the best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at ben white raceway has been that of mary liner ( mainliner-highland ellen ) , a member of the dick williams stable , who was clocked 2 25 .	1485.3749
she is owned by ralph h . kroening , milwaukee , wis . , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her .	996.2278
other good miles have been by debonnie ( dale frost-debby hanover ) and prompt time ( adios-on time ) in 2 28- 36	1076.5398
kimberly gal ( galophone-kimberly hanover ) 2 26 . 2	25.465332
laguerre hanover ( tar heel-lotus hanover ) and monel ( tar heel-miracle byrd ) in 2 34 .	77.69733
laguerre hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait .	1475.5758
this colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them .	432.60916
monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races .	2179.6536
stardel ( star ' s pride-starlette hanover ) , 2 34 , looks quite promising .	606.01556
fury hanover ( hoot mon-fay ) , caper ( hoot mon-columbia hanover ) and isaac ( hoot mon-goddess hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago .	320.08258
fury and caper worked in 2 35 and did it with ease .	386.07285
they are two good colts of different type .	686.0925
fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and caper is more the compact type .	479.62802
i have never seen caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so .	610.7861
fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground .	912.21655
trackdown ( torrid-mighty lady ) has worked a mile in 2 33 . 3 .	156.65234
it took this colt several weeks to strike a pace .	507.94534
then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks .	177.58875
he has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse .	518.7457
thor hanover ( adios-trustful hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet .	591.2745
this colt arrived at the raceway early last november , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot .	989.4946
he appeared in the hopples about november 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace .	510.62906
on december 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all the way .	1494.0383
this colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease .	270.14117
his best mile to date is 2 32 . 2 .	188.49937
gamecock ( tar heel-terka hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2 32 . 2 .	167.26866
this is one of the best-tempered tar heels ever at the center .	1267.8257
the first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare	2152.4575
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff .	525.6525
the fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman .	1189.5789
being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat .	1912.5895
but up to date he has shown as much as any in the big simpson stable .	436.93307
hustler ( knight dream-torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles .	606.3428
torrid freight ( torrid-breeze on hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him .	958.1707
his best time is around 2 33 .	907.0402
strongheart ( adios-direct gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles .	724.2802
torrid adios ( torrid-adios molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but i like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds .	416.6117
blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me .	946.78784
first flyer ( frisco flyer-castle light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the illinois stakes .	1834.7626
the colts in simpson ' s stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers .	559.5195
justine hanover ( sampson hanover-justitia hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2 32 . 4 weeks ago .	495.6373
mrs . freight ( knight dream-miss reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2 35 .	402.68176
hoopla ( tar heel-holiday hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself october 31 and november 1 fighting the hopples .	670.2996
she was then trained on the trot until december 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again .	1785.3062
this time she submitted and in a few days was going good .	254.28468
on january 11 she paced a mile in 2 43 . 1-- 38	3795.46
on jan . 21 , , 2 36 .	75.25909
this filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , valentine day and cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning .	3744.2185
she is more like her full brother , taraday hanover , but larger .	1231.8624
up to date she is a grand-looking filly .	1168.9185
pete dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers .	7725.3022
marquis pick ( gene abbe-direct grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time .	159.6821

i have just seen debonnie and prompt time work a mile in 2 34 , last quarter in 35 . 3 .	929.9344
in going away debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy .	947.1829
they left the three-quarters together and finished almost together .	1006.6223
this filly is another adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise .	791.0301
after well broken and equipped with 12-oz . shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , delvin , driving .	1454.9465
being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled .	1995.3373
she hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , from that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds .	746.725

you ' ve probably given a lot of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it ' s not easy to decide on a new one .	319.91824
you still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you ' d appreciate most	888.7779
the time to decide on them is now .	131.72838
as a christmas service , i ' ve taken a close look at this year ' s crop of new models .	113.35246
here they are , with my comments and judgments .	306.13193
read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints .	2508.957
first on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense .	720.38745
for me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn ' t constitute a truly new design .	742.78766
such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change arms-making concepts .	815.78723
bill ruger ' s long-awaited deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans	1556.0681
it ' s a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail .	2465.0598
ruger reports that on his recent african safari the little magnum cartridge was a real work horse .	1790.703
small antelope were generally grassed with one shot , and the magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency	8226.043
these are fairly large , tough animals .	780.55164
the deadliness of the magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me .	529.6383
at least five years ago , tom robinson of marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber , using the now defunct model 90 action in 20-gauge size .	1698.0145
after figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in marlin ' s underground test gallery .	1829.5853
we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill ruger in his first experiments three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group .	938.2805
ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet .	2551.494
the new , jacketed slug in magnum corrected this .	6475.4355
but even without jacketed bullets , i had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year .	998.15356
within half an hour i jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and i caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards .	6930.426
he moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling .	1065.1013
three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills .	815.81177
my double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in other respects , it ' s considerably heavier than the deerstalker , which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds .	1236.9492
if ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it .	443.83875
the deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp .	689.39923
the 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1 , 850 fps , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges .	1479.6553
with five shots at the immediate command of the hunter ' s trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination .	371.53925
the second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the	1053.9915
at present it ' s available in one model , the fine and familiar smith & wesson magnum revolver ( about $110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms .	1144.0422
, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2 , 460 fps , and it ' s the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range .	1165.3511
this is a varmint load , pure and simple	966.08966
it ' s much too explosive for small edible game .	1591.9236
it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers .	4698.3496
the most intriguing aspect of the s & w magnum chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard	2241.1064
rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers .	2824.2974
you may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( jet vs . rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting .	725.86304
the accuracy of the jet cartridge is fine	4488.835
i tested it in my scoped s & w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun steadily .	1412.443
the fact that the deerstalker and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn ' t mean that 1961 didn ' t see changes in models , actions and calibers .	499.6771
aside from the ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time .	298.65164
here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models .	341.7602
newcomers to the american hunter are the browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles .	2517.672
they have fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood .	926.14105
barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the magnums ( around $170 )	1316.2867
, s & h , , and .	75.22877
shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the magnums except the	315.28848
stock designs are excellent for use with scopes .	1933.6716
colt ' s center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with sako actions , regardless of caliber .	3043.7727
and , the medium action , and the	42.462402
, af and the magnums , the long action ( about $135 for the standard coltsman and $200 for the custom version ) .	1084.2566
previously , fn actions were used for the larger cartridges .	361.69504
auto , the sport-king , in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45 , respectively ) .	784.1538
it ' s a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made .	6264.3374
magnum rim-fire rifles , 1961 ' s lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) .	2422.8455
previously known as jefferson arms , kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle	2966.2837
marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings .	400.1351
the model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined	886.9946
rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles .	5728.903
it ' s extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle i tried was completely trouble-free in functioning .	1531.5629
the 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer	587.7518
auto , this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip .	7305.253
once again the mossberg targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination .	1846.8723
the bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it ' s only 3-1/2 inches long .	1081.3446
you can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with	1659.593
shotshells -- to break the little targo clay targets .	1742.7458
a trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets .	2260.0122
a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available .	1344.7365
you can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340tr ( about $40 ) or a single-shot , the 320tr ( $10 less ) .	1765.169
the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it ' s tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds .	671.3129
they ' ll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it ' s almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark .	782.92236
the combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ! !	688.23645
big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the and to the list of model 725 ' s .	233.79929
these are made on special order only , in kodiak grade ( about $310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads	5089.462
a shortened version of the highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 .	3251.3772
this carbine ( under $140 , about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year ' s model 760 pump with a short-barrel .	1646.7344
this design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard .	1981.0088
presently , the 742c is available in af .	143.5131
the latest versions of the famous savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design .	1845.5499
the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate .	2307.7937
a fresh crop of beginners ' guns showed up in 1961 , and they ' re good bets for your christmas gift list if you ' re wondering what to get for a youngster .	560.84705
the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49 ( about $20 , $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous winchester lever-action and featuring the western look .	4022.772
because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model .	683.2304
the action is a drop-block , handling all the standard	28462.613
marlin ' s latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it ' s a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock .	997.44366
this is the model 122 ( about $20 )	864.80786
it ' s a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i . e . , the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot .	987.08325
stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun .	242.81737
single-shot remington 514c ( around $20 ) , which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock	1266.3539
it ' s just right for a boy of 12-1/2 .	692.664
a beginner ' s shotgun has also been introduced this year .	501.64905
the single-barrel stevens 940y ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren ' t strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily .	806.45795
this gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge .	1157.6449
there ' s another addition to the stevens line , the pump-action model 77 in ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid ' s gun	661.34686
many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too .	1768.0651
although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market .	704.5713
for example , a browning trap version of the superposed over/under , the broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting .	4039.9033
the colt line now includes a new scattergun , the standard or custom pump model ( about $90 and $150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 .	1114.7183
firearms international has introduced another import , this one from finland .	1222.7809
it ' s the valmet ( about $170 ) , a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices .	1329.4944
high standard has also added two models to its line .	346.8296
the supermatic trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto .	1770.5641
the flite-king trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16 .	1081.178
either model is a very good dollar value .	722.7395
mossberg ' s latest contribution to the field is the model 500 ( from $73 . 50 )	1245.2183
this is an improved version of the old model 200 , a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun .	1621.4492
see page 24 for a complete report on it .	238.48766
jet -- which i coupled with the deerstalker carbine as one of the year ' s two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961 ' s handguns .	1085.168
livery stable -- j . vernon , prop . ' ' .	113.73449
coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old wells fargo building in san francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years .	600.4525
john vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom .	659.62634
he had two interests in life the pleasures of the table and driving .	193.09497
twice a week he drove his tallyho over the santa cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the pacific at the other .	987.20984
the journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze .	1307.792
the southward route was the classic run in california , and the most fashionable .	306.17047
his patronage on this stretch was made up largely of san franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself .	1151.2812
they did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco .	527.07837
breakfast was at the palace hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa cruz .	1846.6301
gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals .	2419.1719
then the chinese hostler , who rode with vernon on the box , would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp .	2036.6146
in spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine .	501.75455
they gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare santa lucia fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains .	1198.4509
in the spanish days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense .	12019.163
it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar .	3460.3467
vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves .	886.7603
my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run .	340.2595
this was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table .	548.8151
vernon ' s office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk art of the period .	1222.8309
they advertised harness polish , liniments , ball ' s rubber boots , green river whiskey , hood ' s sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco .	3247.8381
the hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove	1431.149
then a porter from manning ' s fish house would trot in with a tray on his head .	436.1211
it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters .	4841.2495
vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and manning ' s had been famous for them since the civil war .	307.58728
oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at manning ' s .	1011.5553
its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy .	773.3713
in the 1890 ' s the palace hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , john c . kirkpatrick .	1225.1212
this dish much resembles the oysters rockefeller made famous by antoine ' s in new orleans , though the palace chef announced it as a variant of manning ' s roast oysters .	1287.6903
( gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the palace ' s or antoine ' s .	310.54178
antoine ' s held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding .	3903.0706
the kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional .	13966.373
) vernon , however , held out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a bit of lemon .	1614.505
after the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig	592.4234
this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned .	552.72095
the tallyho had cost vernon $2 , 300 .	1365.4207
a replica of two coaches made in england for the belmont club in the east , and matchless west of the rockies , it was the despair of whips on the santa cruz run .	689.0545
one could shave in the reflection of its french-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels .	2916.5928
the horses were groomed to a high gloss	1836.852
departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals .	1321.7367
but for the start of the santa cruz run , the whip fell .	526.1026
the clients boarded the tallyho at the palace promptly at seven .	2741.1006
they had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox hunting , was on the bill .	786.04584
there are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right .	263.12228
here is an original kedgeree recipe from the family club ' s kitchen	1054.2277
flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled eggs , some buttery white sauce done with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a bit of anchovy .	2635.02
heat and serve hot on toast .	3020.59
the omelet named for ernest arbogast , the palace ' s chef , was even more in demand .	302.33826
for decades it was the most popular dish served in the ladies ' grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old palace dishes that still survive .	592.31775
native california oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it .	2086.4404
fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg .	2056.6775
a jigger of dry sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters .	731.652
louis sherry once stayed a fortnight at the palace , and he was so pleased with omelet arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in new york j . pierpont morgan had come in his private train to san francisco , to attend an episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him .	583.2462
as things happened , morgan was installed in the nob hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent .	2687.2
sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could .	1071.081
twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the santa cruz tour under vernon ' s guidance .	557.2669
in the grand court of the palace , notable for its tiers of moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , vernon ' s station was at the entrance .	684.4996
it was a post of honor , held inviolate for him	893.7895
he had the primacy among the coachmen .	449.63565
of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late general winfield scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries .	622.61536
vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly .	21129.945
promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho .	465.9755
he had style he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them .	728.2243
they cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached woodside where the santa cruz uplands begin .	4521.4575
the road maps of the region have changed since 1905	1481.8787
inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names .	317.54868
once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing .	943.1704
an agreeable ease suffused vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke .	584.6535
vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar .	1841.4799
the horses moved at a clump	28296.812
they were no more on parade than was their driver	1958.1106
one fork of the road was as good as another .	442.64252
the santa cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the santa clara valley below at the left .	7464.1206
the water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery .	21459.785
you arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh .	2310.565
vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage .	641.4623
a number of them must have fallen into disfavor	3991.4739
they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management .	678.32697
he was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat .	325.4487
the horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used to say such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins .	1932.7074
there was wright ' s , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers .	1880.1687
many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days .	334.2903
it was the haunt of writer ambrose bierce , who admired its redwoods .	18312.166
acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to berkshires ) , whose `` carcass sweepstakes ' ' were renowned .	2316.0715
their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce	3319.8904
put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic cloves .	1738.5958
contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime .	2889.8926
after this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of sherry .	1916.409
every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed .	345.55307
vineyards and orchards also grew around wright ' s , and deer were rather a nuisance	872.3233
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers .	720.249
but no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies .	1658.8943
no one complained of the white wine either at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint .	1692.574
( the almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height .	510.07153
) apple trees grew there also .	252.39561
though creeks in the santa cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle .	3051.853
dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets .	3187.9397
the merit of the pie , vernon believed , was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven .	710.1231
the recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this	419.92166
peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set aside .	834.9005
in a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay leaf .	1357.9413
let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain .	270.60995
poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool .	570.752
set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg .	1984.1116
those who have never traveled the width and length of this land cannot conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government .	448.7127
the miracle of democratic america comes home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless great plains of the midwest	787.75574
the sky-reaching peaks of the northwest mountains	937.0903
the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the east	345.43347
the lush and historic charm of the south .	174.1034
now , to add to the already unbelievable extremes found in one nation , we have the two new states of hawaii and alaska .	535.69354
to hope to cover just one region of this land and to enjoy all of its sights and events and , of course , to bring back pictures of your experiences , requires advance planning .	295.42108
for this reason , u . s . camera has prepared this special u . s . a . vacation feature .	108.787285
we divided the country into five regions plus hawaii and alaska and in each is included a general description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events to cover .	501.50458
any special photographic requirements are also given .	318.17267

built upon seven hills , istanbul , like rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast .	288.27466
it is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses .	808.2365
at the moment , many of these are being pulled down .	306.65002
whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the bosphorus and the golden horn .	880.9959
even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents .	302.3877
for almost 3 , 000 years europe and asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets .	981.28516
founded in the ninth century b . c . it was called byzantium 200 years later when byzas , ruler of the megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself .	1088.216
about a thousand years after that , when the roman empire was divided , it became capital of the eastern section .	249.72623
on may 11 , 330 , a . d . , , its name was changed again , this time to constantinople after its emperor , constantine .	532.08746
in 1453 when the last vestige of ancient roman power fell to the turks , the city officially shifted religions -- although the patriarch , or pope , of the orthodox church continued to live there , and still does -- and became the capital of the ottoman empire .	755.7166
when that was broken up after the first world war , its name was changed once more .	423.17093
rich in christian and moslem art , istanbul is today a fascinating museum of east and west that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the bosphorus and the sea of marmara only a short distance from the center of town .	763.9994
easy to get to , and becoming more popular every year , it is only fourteen hours from new york by pan american world airways jet , four hours from rome .	589.5884
most of the sights lie in the old section across the golden horn from the modern hotels .	453.64926
i started my tour of them at the turkish government tourist office , next to pan american ' s office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the hilton hotel .	532.54913
from there i turned left along cumhuriyet cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left , republic gardens , and came in a few moments to taksim square , one of the hubs of the city , with the monument of the republic , erected in 1928 , in its center .	508.48306
directly across from the gardens i found a bus stop sign for t 4 and rode it down to the bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before i reached the water and the entrance to dolmabahce palace immediately after that .	762.90436
there the bus turned right along the bosphorus , past ocean liners at anchor , to galata bridge over the entrance to the golden horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the bosphorus .	1160.2787
across the bridge on the left i saw st . sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the blue mosque .	501.76743
on the other side of the golden horn i rode through eminonu square , with yeni cami , or the new mosque , which dates from the seventeenth century , just across from the entrance to the bridge .	474.22195
passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on the right and pandelli ' s , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it .	870.8446
at the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park .	236.61617
i got off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with st . sophia on my left , the blue mosque on my right , and in a moment came to the entrance of st . sophia .	169.67064
erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous st . sophias , the first of which was begun by constantine , this fourth church was started by justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later .	749.94434
on his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than solomon ' s in jerusalem .	866.8843
a few years later the dome fell in .	617.20123
nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the eastern empire , where the byzantine emperors were crowned .	523.127
after the turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets .	1140.3942
in the second half of the sixteenth century , sinan , the great architect who is the michelangelo of the east , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome .	404.62442
with the birth of the turkish republic after the first world war , st . sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered over by the moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy places , have been restored .	776.9333
inside over the first door i saw one of these , which shows constantine offering the city to the virgin mary and justinian offering the temple .	652.05084
on the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with arabic writing .	1793.2494
the eight green columns , i learned , came from the temple of artemis at ephesus , the others , red , from the temple of the sun at heliopolis .	259.4409
beneath the dome i saw the spot where the byzantine emperors were crowned , a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence .	1535.4391
behind this is a minber or moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat .	1263.2201
directly opposite is the emperor ' s door , through which they entered the building .	204.50479
outside st . sophia i walked through the flower garden in front of it , with the blue mosque ahead on my left .	324.7968
across the street on my right i saw the hippodrome , now a park .	442.48444
it was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games .	1616.5925
statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of crusaders .	703.84467
at the beginning of the hippodrome i saw the kaiser ' s fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the german emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of sultan ahmet , who constructed the blue mosque , more properly known by his name .	644.4874
just before coming to the mosque entrance i crossed the street , entered the hippodrome , and walked ahead to the obelisk of theodosius , originally erected in heliopolis in egypt about 1 , 600 b . c . by thutmose , who also built those now in new york , london and rome at the lateran .	776.2904
this one was set up here in 390 a . d . on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them .	447.3367
beyond it i noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the serpentine column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the temple of apollo at delphi , greece .	1397.4395
near the end of the hippodrome i came upon the built column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the colossus of rhodes .	751.3876
retracing my steps to the mosque of sultan ahmet , only one with six minarets , i entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle .	761.12823
one of the most beautiful buildings in istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the seventeenth century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery .	501.6665
the round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer .	2037.4016
inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets .	595.02
back at the kaiser ' s fountain , i walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the column of constantine , also known as the burnt column , at the top on my right .	368.0885
it stands in the middle of what was once the forum of constantine , who brought it from rome .	349.81628
i stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , bayezit , with the bayezit mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it .	496.22824
there i got off , crossed the square , and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come by in this part of the city .	228.01926
called the marmara gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the sea of marmara .	392.35727
after lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street i found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in istanbul .	1384.2775
it ' s a great favorite of the university students , and i joined them there for dessert .	627.3834
taking the streetcar back to kaiser ' s fountain , i walked ahead , then left down the street opposite st . sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the sunken palace .	488.702
actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was built by justinian in the sixth century to supply the palace with water .	454.5702
there is still water in it .	75.35935
i found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately .	3197.915
outside i walked past the entrance to st . sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead .	203.27292
just before reaching it i came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an oriental pagoda , with arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the fountain of sultan ahmet .	1655.0631
going through the imperial gate in the wall , i entered the grounds of topkapi palace , home of the sultans and nerve center of the vast ottoman empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the church of st . irene , completed by constantine in 330 a . d . on my left , and then , just outside the second gate , i saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the executioner ' s spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims .	494.1982
passing through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , i entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in english for each building .	463.26776
there are a good many of them .	99.882385
at one time about 10 , 000 people lived there .	249.40706
following arrowed signs , i veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world ' s greatest collections of chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services .	997.3866
next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe .	1207.467
in the court once more , i went right toward the reception house , a long one-story building with a deep portico .	657.35645
going through a door into another small court , i had the throne room directly in front .	346.1882
i walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the treasury , which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on which the sultans sat cross-legged .	3548.5303
they are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels .	1542.4243
taking the path behind the throne room to the building directly beyond it , the portrait gallery , i went right at the end of it , through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs .	612.049
( do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals .	754.99194
keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease .	1069.5011

don ' t forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces .	706.589
clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly .	5163.9526
do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit .	1552.6356
make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such .	427.36935
don ' t fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops .	1200.1077
sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results .	7472.824
do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them .	1709.7245
if doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half .	807.99414
if necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time .	5850.158
for roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone .	1672.197
also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals .	1189.1315
don ' t practice a new recipe on guests .	646.2187
have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right .	351.206
do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it .	303.8826
keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator .	832.24976
don ' t plan meals that are too complicated .	702.6907
limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories .	688.70496
do whatever kitchen work , such as fixing a salad , preparing garlic bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead of time .	928.7905
when you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen .	737.4801
( this goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins .	909.62085
don ' t think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world .	145.82664
the simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef .	2785.455
you need tongs to handle meat	7014.6343
long forks for turning potatoes and corn	2426.3403
heavy foil on hand at all times .	147.0803
and lots of hot pads ! !	806.09924
do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up , flames cannot reach the meat .	1754.4448
don ' t forget to have a supply of melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use .	822.43335
made of the world ' s toughest unbreakable plastic , melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors .	2686.5696
there is even one set that has `` barbecue ' ' written on it .	169.19083
it ' s cheaper to buy wall-tex and cover your outdoor table .	2823.052
or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues .	1450.6307
oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best .	1097.2294
tougher than plastic , it wears well .	733.523
don ' t forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments .	959.8719
there are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes .	728.1757
with them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in a-1 condition .	2132.1487
except when you prepare `` do it yourself ' ' shish kebob or a lobster roast .	5736.4907
then you ' ll want terry cloth towels for mopping up .	15509.84
don ' t think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal .	2938.1982
in the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace .	682.6129

go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties .	2669.9675
threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast .	1175.1711
sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite .	204.47787
a story goes that a certain herr feuchtwanger of st . louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers .	1210.0082
so that his customers should not soil their hands , feuchtwanger issued white gloves .	3229.35
discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise .	2226.773
he had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks .	5439.9766
years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go ' ' at the new york polo grounds .	291.39096
the nation ' s number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill .	3752.9807
either way it ' s hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation .	567.335
to make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips	2693.0916
-- score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through .	294.10382
this permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking .	1241.1287
-- relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns .	191.92064
bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd .	2495.346
-- using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too .	1007.0789
watch closely while browning them , as it doesn ' t take long .	67.48192
-- an unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in french dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic .	1130.2766
contrary to popular opinion , `` a la mode ' ' doesn ' t mean `` with ice cream ' ' -- it just means , in the latest style .	206.42122

ceramic modeling clay red , white or buff .	1151.976
glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions .	704.15955
use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking .	3069.6382
clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly	28808.807
they must be free of oil , wax and dust .	350.67584
the size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed .	271.0807
roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions .	494.61145
whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay .	646.25226
when mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns .	1100.0028
place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects	2134.0762
experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) .	1114.3059
place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold .	4095.7773
to obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges .	1343.2169
trim excess clay away from outer edges .	786.1868
check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay .	1184.7959
be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles .	1508.9108
allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) .	876.0044
to release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project	4787.6406
gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold .	1738.7418
slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold .	660.06805
place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action .	1627.0109
this will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired .	10806.487
place project on table and carefully lift the mold off .	637.266
study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections .	3545.3403
if clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers .	2279.3315
if the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush .	419.14487
make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) .	3404.9387
leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping .	1058.7777

hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat .	1537.19
menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view .	1020.88226
youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet .	4717.332
the gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit .	2973.7275
all are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern .	741.5176
and with passenger weight shifted forward , hotei levels off for speed under power of a merc 800 .	1781.5516
the 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard ! !	1538.5349
with only two aboard , hotei does better than 27 mph -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop .	1644.4479
she also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser .	1638.2836
nor is she a wet boat .	1939.1924
we ' ve been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry .	2165.2532
a lot of thought went into storage space construction .	836.668
there ' s a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items .	757.75934
the cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life jackets , etc . .	1219.9341
the aft cockpit has a af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat .	1214.7174
on each side of the motor well there ' s storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below .	6314.8604
the well itself is designed to take two merc 800 ' s or 500 ' s if you wish and there ' s room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it .	887.75665
needless to say , you can ' t build hotei in a couple of weeks .	217.0549
our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $800 .	1029.3112
a comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3 , 000 .	372.41406
consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3 , 000 and your building time is well worth it .	257.0348
a gator trailer , model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways .	1366.6746
this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years .	920.74304
all framing in hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings .	785.03674
therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc . , on a table saw .	599.54443
besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze stronghold nails ( made by independent nail & packing co . , bridgewater , mass . ) are used extensively in assembly and weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints .	2463.6907
construction follows a thorough study of the drawings .	97.69618
start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor .	319.7276
draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other .	578.37024
in this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes .	233.04898
the transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails .	1642.8788
after notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails .	1049.5164
all frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , no . 12 nails .	1092.8083
the frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines .	440.7783
if notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through .	1649.0911
nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking .	540.5599
the jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete .	333.3423
this is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction .	3784.548
be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required .	1524.7345
after the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced , a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson .	1044.6388
the frames are glued and screwed to this piece .	208.90096
the joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated fiberglas cloth and nailed .	2401.1755
it is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced .	2868.2073
the keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed .	1643.6829
the first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two .	907.27985
the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first .	644.5458
note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end .	361.14322
one-inch , no . 10 screws are used in both cases .	569.1418
a stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one .	743.35956
the stem is laminated from four pieces .	367.01447
take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four .	257.3905
then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig .	359.48816
the first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames .	411.88684
the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member .	755.739
they ' re glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson .	178.75208
a number of c clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets .	1418.1896
all bottom battens are two inches wide .	1508.5453
the side ones are a half-inch narrower .	3720.7292
the battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames .	923.61005
glue and 1-1/2-inch , no . 10 screws are used .	492.5617
placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens .	1196.639
with the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling .	886.2248
the chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending .	757.27496
fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple jig .	848.1077
i clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of sure grips .	436.35822
the aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily .	2192.6985
if you don ' t own a planer and don ' t want to buy one , it ' s well worth renting .	229.85135
the planking is five-ply , 3/8-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood .	19416.963
this can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long .	5509.795
the 42-inch width leaves very little waste .	753.1711
plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , no . 12 stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom .	522.67645
another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening .	1081.6514
the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off .	1032.4075
i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter cable for this job .	2014.4113
it ' s good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw .	2393.3967
when cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming .	1624.3481
then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens .	355.14584
it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings .	4832.711
the next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points .	374.39597
then it is replaced and fastened .	341.98108
the bottom planking is applied in the same manner .	124.18135
after planking , the bottom gets a layer of fiberglas .	1178.2555
the spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws .	460.14566
then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation .	1045.5219
since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area .	604.7068
the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time .	84.61502
a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches .	568.6977
lay the cloth in place and trim it to size .	445.57272
then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin .	965.4197
when the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish .	2061.5732
i used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener .	3893.256
using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth .	429.73816
when the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller .	1784.2587
be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden .	2651.9373
when the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail .	1302.0481
then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem .	311.46375
before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline .	8425.465
this protects the bottom in beaching .	2674.459
fiberglas materials are available from glass plastic supply co . , 1605 w . elizabeth ave . , linden , n . j . .	479.70346
they will also supply literature on application .	459.37442
the hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , well-braced position .	447.36996
i set it on the gator trailer .	3259.7817
i laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time .	355.5776
for added strength , i also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint .	979.33215
again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed .	1850.8245
after trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is installed .	454.49237
this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom .	702.8861
these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry .	486.20496
when they ' re on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten .	1732.162
the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace .	1638.0806
note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces .	888.1136
the decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood .	1709.3282
all the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood .	6688.53
most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring .	349.93207
the exception is where the flooring butts .	1506.4751
these battens are glued and screwed to the frames .	136.35448
with all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line .	431.63843
use one coat of firzite and one coat of marine paint .	11968.595
bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place .	454.51038
after the decking is on , the cabin sides are installed .	863.08344
they ' re followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated .	1067.0548
the windshield glass is shatterproof and plexiglas is used in the cabin .	1557.1458
inside , bunks are framed up and installed as indicated .	1003.0335
a head is a handy thing to have and i installed one under a removable section of the port bunk .	805.6355
the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink .	2926.4712
for padding the seats and bunks , i used ensolite , type aj .	1114.8517
lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement .	2129.4734
available in af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot .	397.30603
you can build this vacation cottage yourself .	6344.578
it is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year ' round retreat complete in every detail .	1143.6272
because of the unique design by the architect egils hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time .	934.61584
most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools .	1416.7275
on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim .	547.12823
in recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind .	1026.7429
it is a big project , not to be taken lightly .	385.32834
but each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman .	914.9397
the idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization .	1910.6962
everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials .	963.6609
wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting .	820.5503
we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan .	428.33905
thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend .	464.8867
the roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days .	595.9824
then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure .	1034.267
due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are .	249.62764
close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used	412.28668
in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all .	246.1658
this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall .	405.70575
at the same time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as well as possible zoning regulations .	1418.6779
whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) .	2285.9502
be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion .	1688.7737
if there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form .	704.7699
where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one .	420.39368
in many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector .	353.3757
these will be available at cost from our plans department .	436.18347
some general things to look for in a site , if you haven ' t already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation .	284.68802
how are the roads , and how will they stand up ? ?	189.80096
is there evidence of wash-outs on the property	2594.357
swampy areas or intermittent springs ? ?	195.46262
a visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative .	1233.0331
note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from .	1088.4712
will the view be something you can live with ? ?	146.36221
don ' t worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain	11725.31
we will take up alternative foundations later on .	4044.4329
with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( aja version ) and the expandable ( ajb version ) .	555.2208
this will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony .	340.83093
this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost .	452.10715
bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues .	839.0472
the wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard af and af of a good grade , free from structural faults .	297.69565
they should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected .	867.84125
the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer .	1624.2367
the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired .	404.6277
all panel board comes in standard af foot size .	1100.1376
it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame .	1024.3531
the fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound .	6670.1714
the louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation .	228.3891
there are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them .	1680.0118
the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .	499.4122
the filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage .	1759.162
the battens covering the joints are of af stock and are applied after the walls are erected .	416.0439
all nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended .	2823.632
note if 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in af , af , and af can be used in making the glass panels .	499.53555
other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim .	4045.5244
in any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels .	802.9631
with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool .	1295.071
the drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed .	572.93207
there is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted .	519.35925
the size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column .	1299.8564
a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle .	993.709
a new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle .	1763.9464
the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work .	755.91486
the drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws .	1134.8146
this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy .	324.1448
a coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table	1011.2278
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill .	4304.205
presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill .	1308.9419
the rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush .	1314.6641
be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease .	1307.8325
belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount .	2419.7432
keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won ' t slip when pulled by hand	2371.017
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings .	1370.3556
most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position .	1170.6873
the return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved .	1224.93
turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it .	1291.2855
some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key	724.47644
otherwise , you ' ll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use .	428.6341
drill speeds are important if you want a good job .	166.01144
each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked .	358.2547
on most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys .	378.311
you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool .	1715.1438
see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds .	2720.8809
generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed .	215.8047
feed pressure is also of major importance .	246.7501
too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools .	1127.1555
too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge .	722.28986
the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate .	760.95447
there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes .	992.9166
the most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit .	1283.9215
all will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don ' t cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts .	984.1778
the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade .	2277.742
since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding .	736.995
fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way .	831.8086
when drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath .	2289.619
this will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough .	771.13055
another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side .	566.5194
in soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood .	528.028
in this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy .	1746.7201
when a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark .	256.52948
the depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .	1054.3724
the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects .	700.67786
for their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered .	298.77457
in this sequence i shall write about them in the order of their erection .	198.2205
the first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected newbury ( now newburyport ) with salisbury point .	656.7627
its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly newburyport men , petitioned the general court for an act of incorporation .	668.1523
this document began `` no . 1 newbury port , may 30th , 1791	4174.365
`` whereas , a bridge over merrimack river , from the land of hon ' ble jonathan greenleaf , esquire , in newbery , to deer island , and from said island to salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe conveyance to carriages , teams and travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all times of tide .	1679.8131
`` we , the subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to this , or a similar writing , we will present a petition to the hon ' ble general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts , praying for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such writing with liberty to build such a bridge , and a right to demand a toll equal to that received at malden bridge , and on like terms , and if such an act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares set against our respective names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of money at such times and in such manners , as by the said proposed corporation , shall be directed and required ' ' .	459.11996
this paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares .	644.41156
a month later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that the bridge was to be built .	578.4822
the matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the court granted a charter on january 9 , 1792 .	407.77283
on november 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened .	360.33322
timothy palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex , or `` deer island ' ' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of william coombs , who received $300 as recompense .	723.6761
this two-part bridge is best described by rev . timothy dwight , president of yale college , in his `` travels in new-england and new-york ' ' , published in new haven in 1821 .	674.79865
`` it consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .	498.52924
the division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch	1932.4991
whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark .	2483.201
in appearance and construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge .	5098.6626
the whole length of essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four .	2853.9492
i have already mentioned that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country .	307.18915
as mr . palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature	479.57816
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention ' ' .	82.307434
it is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby rowley	5240.3027
that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was sixteen years old	1110.4741
and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , moody spofford .	1206.2867
it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth , haverhill , and philadelphia .	399.739
the essex merrimack bridge when first built was not covered .	457.1423
as far as we know , no american bridge had been thus protected in 1792 .	596.80853
richard s . allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 .	736.0815
its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` massachusetts magazine ' ' in may 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( fig . 1 ) .	602.38605
a brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber .	979.0777
between the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet	2382.9587
between the north shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long .	790.95996
a dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place july 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island .	367.6296
it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion .	573.07635
the `` essex journal ' ' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly ciceronian ' ' .	461.37735
the reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because dexter ' s oration could hardly be understood	2067.0818
and , although he later explained that he was talking french , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening .	356.6234
the north portion of the essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning .	243.81248
it stood in its original form until 1882 .	7589.3096
the southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation .	967.30615
in 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge .	984.7031
this was built by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette county , pennsylvania .	2636.3535
timothy palmer had general supervision of the work .	93.29341
an advertisement in the `` newburyport herald ' ' , december 21 , 1810 , shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges .	790.9641
information is hereby given that mr . timothy palmer of newburyport , mass . has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the chain bridge , in the states of massachusetts , new hampshire , vermont , rhode island , and connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges .	265.43875
`` mr . palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it .	815.61523
this chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end .	589.7059
it fell , february 6 , 1827 , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen .	635.90857
the horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned .	1021.1719
in spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on july 17 , 1827 .	593.5023
this second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway .	2061.1367
the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the county commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways .	1747.9349
sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site , may 28th to june 3rd .	787.7922
colonel frederick w . lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott ' s ( now college ) hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel benjamin f . kelley ' s ( west ) virginia infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates .	2650.8892
he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction	879.7999
that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the ' 60s .	584.20874
the bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years .	392.52774
twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister .	434.17065
it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on u . s . route 250 -- the old beverly and fairmont turnpike .	592.5474
it is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the u . s . highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days .	197.07288
this covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of june 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story .	392.57394
so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known structures in west virginia .	1181.9238
completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth and his brother , eli , of beverly .	1373.6902
the chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties .	986.52234
the philippi bridge , however , was the chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders .	833.9822
never rebuilt , the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic .	825.3798
during the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior .	1384.2727
union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams .	1448.5514
but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when brigadier general william e . ( grumble ) jones reached philippi while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may , 1863 .	1959.9414
general jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it .	839.577
reverend joshual corder , a baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies , to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure	752.3742
he reasoned and argued , pointing out that jones or other confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat .	1581.2373
jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the confederate army , while jones and his raiders turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden .	1061.3683
again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing confederate force .	1161.5735
on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose .	405.73593
centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on may 28th and continuing through june 3rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi .	1023.00385
it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years .	2581.895
we have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there .	1909.687
we have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy .	1296.7593
we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds .	8358.94
true , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions .	2000.2244
but problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows .	2231.6296
so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience .	691.7969
position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical .	368.58344
one of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house .	478.9289
the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill .	289.2847
if you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys .	2439.9937
you are likely to be nearer the truth .	141.3961
you can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let ' s-make-your-house-our-club attitude .	589.1424
on the other hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool .	792.69904
another dilemma as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool .	564.80316
yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .	1640.8823
as in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good .	417.59857
in the colder climes , for instance , you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best .	404.5818
it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs .	1581.5157
even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold .	3935.6416
( we do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool .	3269.6267
probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts .	349.3777
naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land .	359.71072
but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house .	537.1208
and a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement .	5553.6865
the placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety .	1191.6858
coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet .	724.4522
eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master ' s delectation .	1290.0103
but not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies .	11150.659
we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards .	1706.893
our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled .	534.1936
had we taken a lien on a state park ? ?	669.32196
we had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .	1219.3635
from proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks .	1612.2115
naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool ' ' were both unexpected and unsettling .	712.2809
after the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result .	808.8187
so rules we made , in unabashed collusion .	4725.9775
since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners .	1997.2745
first and foremost no one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle .	547.19476
just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view .	1687.7023
their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times .	208.68929
no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand .	3867.5994
no ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees .	1755.866
we want to know when the potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won ' t end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august .	922.9977
no young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party .	966.6012
and accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities .	760.2943
a gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard .	594.7233
no bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run .	1681.5161
( sanity , solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop .	2008.5288
we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours .	1573.2421
this has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate ' ' than ours .	1002.7064
we also worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille .	5013.3535
we gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides .	575.3585
all dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers ' homes .	515.7124
( to avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area .	417.69974
) we do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences .	1214.7946
life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young .	679.8768
safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together .	253.88611
in many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet .	444.31586
but fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay .	1266.1932
we allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo .	2348.2576
diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ) .	4387.876
and divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge .	1017.7341
our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords .	1031.2856
all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups .	1234.552
when you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent .	1268.7335
you should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits .	1576.5146
soignee pools , alas , do not just happen .	350.287
they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements .	207.62575
unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool ' s pristine purity , its care and feeding -- from ph content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service .	1810.5486
of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) .	815.7222
or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers .	1301.3448
even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work .	417.05292
a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis .	1183.3613
a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight .	1274.7952
with or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse .	258.6718
you should see to it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in front of the filter , is always clean .	303.6711
a pool is no place for a shut trap .	429.96674
you should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water .	1039.3993
when shed , they leave rust marks .	4516.704
you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing .	3267.6877
many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall .	544.12634
as the pool is emptied , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet .	718.9588
much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry .	2193.2183
if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe , you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out .	2273.2737
of course , when your 6-inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties .	844.5902
if your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris .	1657.4213
it may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around .	3430.875
once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present .	959.0735
often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense .	300.1162
our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes .	1021.82166
follow pool-care instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming , `` it wasn ' t my turn ' ' .	178.7409
never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship .	411.0357
you may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in .	675.8652
draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania .	282.6147
any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years .	453.87146
fortunately , it is the fha which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress .	435.60107
even if you live above that line , the fha will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged .	420.0921
new simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 .	2441.1377
two men can often do the installation in a day .	120.961945
you can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .	470.9371
no less an authority than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs .	2619.9277
home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted .	848.73395
we know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want .	1432.9622
we know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling .	2373.5974
on the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills .	1370.9484
the filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever .	7657.051
control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid .	869.10645
heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat .	4605.3887
the cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine .	1264.4248
the need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent .	4129.2046
clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words .	3392.431
when you ' re less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter .	4214.8
the children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms .	3173.64
you ' ll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves .	1511.421
you can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around .	1010.0283
best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford .	787.9578
like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more .	263.32202
that brings its per-year cost down mighty low .	3026.2905
no matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed .	1930.1554
the equipment won ' t take up valuable space either .	597.41614
it can go in out-of-the-way waste space .	5415.3535
but there ' s no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year- ' round whole-house air conditioning is when you build .	2067.959
if that ' s done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself .	306.02145
if you can ' t see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later .	825.35223
manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial .	609.6992
if your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it .	237.32759
this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling .	2069.8728
you can get year- ' round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow .	1070.5347
the units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area .	873.3413
the cooling coil is located in the furnace ' s outlet .	209.15982
from the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement .	2822.9456
if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for .	442.19635
be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .	1004.2486
be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling .	958.3965
this is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone .	896.3571
be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating .	1240.2347
you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .	688.4475
for cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water .	1073.9629
instead of radiators you ' ll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat .	504.4132
these systems are more expensive than year- ' round forced air systems .	1944.5045
the minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone .	760.99835
if the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system .	929.39087
the simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit .	1775.5066
it is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted .	2795.7344
in a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone .	601.4027
in a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second .	194.06131
in each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control .	1322.5549
one of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating .	371.61917
as you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors .	3543.721
a relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors .	1426.0652
up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees .	2737.3857
now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees .	397.03467
you can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .	837.4292
consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don ' t want to start up your whole heating plant .	1134.4471
how large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors .	285.3145
among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family .	573.1971
families with children usually don ' t want the house quite so cool .	295.56015
if you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity .	893.4115
the body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load .	1185.4634
cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of aj .	107.986
a btu is a unit of heat , and the btu rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour .	781.3142
a very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you ' ll need 15 btu ' s of cooling for every square foot of your house .	478.20233
this is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees .	1401.639
you ' ll need more if the high average is above that , less if it ' s below .	197.11714
coolers are also rated by tons .	480.9568
a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice .	1028.7454
by accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12 , 000 btu of cooling in one hour .	800.5774
you may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .	6486.2393
it is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you ' ll get .	625.41504
a 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8 , 000 btu to well over 10 , 000 aj .	296.22202
the safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .	340.39468
don ' t urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough .	480.14883
better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big .	4902.046
reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .	585.81885
an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period .	631.1296
before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low .	1192.1649
with a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature .	3271.3608
attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately .	1359.563
a well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month .	1175.2944
if you have a house which heat doesn ' t penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove .	759.5182
keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you ' ve won the first battle .	273.46185
in a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution .	4220.5312
if the house you plan to buy or build won ' t have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .	1501.2646
shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .	228.26555
drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house .	338.39862
the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact .	835.1438
the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you ' re going to need .	453.4425
a shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .	919.10333
you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation .	1212.3838
restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house .	106.12195
an attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool .	1351.8162
you ' ll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one .	736.8639
gas adds to the moisture load .	3802.358
insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum .	1757.988
in insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 .	2299.4058
they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors .	347.43723
such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling .	901.7093
a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent .	428.27597
it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary btu is worth attention .	604.7979
you ' ll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier .	2733.9668
it ' s no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum .	536.24097
good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you ' re doing your own contracting , don ' t award the job on the basis of price alone .	275.63086
avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom .	452.88477
most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning .	597.63007
this is particularly true in site selection .	2883.0876
you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are	354.46997
you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed .	536.3519
with such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .	408.54626
begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible .	851.47455
these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .	413.3418
the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .	1141.005
these are inexpensive and available from the u . s . geological society , washington 25 , d . c . .	64.177864
in recent years many counties and the u . s . forest service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .	389.6954
most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor ' s office showing ownerships of land .	3238.519
inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation .	130.15651
this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons .	250.42894
it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site .	192.4352
these are a great aid for planning use back at the office .	333.01437
for site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study .	324.07465
however , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .	362.06552
county judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences .	1226.1626
a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .	674.9312
how much study is required ? ?	159.74661
this , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision .	156.32954
it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone .	217.69495
usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions .	1005.91064
a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water .	1504.4407
the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .	670.08704
in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others .	449.23486
you need answers to four important questions .	593.2746
what are the existing recreation features ? ?	534.59015
how well can the site be developed ? ?	422.11127
how useful will it be to the public ? ?	70.07276
check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site .	294.77957
naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes .	879.3084
frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water .	573.50275
some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .	704.2243
one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery .	914.8507
it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees .	601.40643
a site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .	473.84286
an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .	2566.4573
a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs .	289.59067
note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .	185.00162
water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .	255.67368
most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .	917.46796
this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports .	895.5706
a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use .	1389.2242
it also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life .	1029.2155
the amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important .	249.95961
a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .	437.38333
the quantity of water flow may be critical	348.07465
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .	716.6635
if the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied .	304.9399
check the quality of the water .	42.36142
a stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area .	1269.9458
other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .	862.3738
other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed .	893.262
just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area .	746.2526
although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .	249.91968
the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them .	727.5131
a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .	354.98807
the fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .	138.27185
fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission .	363.68546
animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .	481.83804
the site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life .	1515.281
clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas .	840.2038
each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .	392.40814
park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .	263.2252
the historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered .	493.39456
notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth ' s crust in your region .	720.1144
those which tell a story of the earth ' s formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .	337.52417
an old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest .	1038.313
some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .	2104.7146
how well can the site be developed ? ?	422.11127
look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites .	270.33163
many things need to be checked	332.79007
-- the size of the area alone can be a determining factor .	273.24234
an area may be too small for the needs of the project .	103.94513
areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments .	427.40826
acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .	473.15448
shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development .	336.7477
a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide .	1225.6505
this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions .	1200.822
however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman ' s trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit .	650.3492
-- the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there .	216.49889
for instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not .	868.32227
the utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .	342.20474
check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil .	1532.8744
nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera .	1047.7817
determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .	1159.6133
-- in addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation .	793.8092
the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .	750.2315
the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines .	995.4751
figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .	297.42023
-- the existing plant growth calls for thorough checking .	3109.248
look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera .	339.61276
an area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up .	5470.025
some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared .	1110.9576
the extent and location of open areas is noted .	284.2003
-- how much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ?	611.2814
an area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use .	700.3765
the direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area .	234.58499
lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable .	872.26794
sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended .	451.33472
-- some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site .	375.2122
your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his 70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because i admire the music of prokofieff	2062.2683
and with sober purpose , because the development of prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the union of soviet socialist republics .	305.29578
the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the united states of america was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician .	717.4903
these qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-world war 1 , era .	1137.5446
prokofieff ' s outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in america was , indeed , brilliant .	400.17822
prokofieff ' s classical symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties .	1896.3623
to the traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism	1107.7499
to the neo-classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world .	169.10663
what was it to prokofieff ? ?	510.8475
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times	342.177
a brilliant piece de resistance ? ?	173.03665
certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .	2020.5199
i heard the classical symphony for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927 .	593.2794
some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical .	655.22003
i myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) .	188.9214
i remember ernest bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon dieu , can anyone take this music seriously ' ' ? ?	973.1507
the answer is , `` yes ' ' ! !	45.510384
certainly , america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure .	469.37967
his life-long friend , serge koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in boston , new york , and washington , d . c . , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation .	312.44162
chicago was also a welcome host there , in 1921 , prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the love for three oranges , and played the first performance of his third piano concerto .	580.5132
`` uncle sam ' ' was , indeed , a rich uncle to prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure `` the golden twenties ' ' .	746.1604
we attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites	717.1551
we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches	1381.8169
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .	263.23624
we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers .	761.27344
nevertheless , prokofieff was much influenced by paris during the twenties the paris which was the artistic center of the western world -- the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich america -- the avant-garde paris of diaghileff , stravinsky , koussevitzky , cocteau , picasso -- the laissez-faire paris of dadaism and ultramodern art -- the paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .	1891.4857
so young prokofieff was the darling of success in his motherland	1831.3538
in the spacious hunting grounds of `` uncle sam ' '	178.94388
in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .	1491.6813
meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .	9561.4795
in this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , prokofieff was recalled to his native land .	378.72125
the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist tyranny into cringing submission .	4128.0547
after this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men	634.27264
a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure .	595.5137
in this changed world , prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose .	334.92407
here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world .	680.3808
here , prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism -- producing music for the masses .	625.1488
it is at this point in his life that the mature prokofieff emerges .	412.81607
one might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .	2611.5261
he accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise .	386.33176
by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people `` i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody .	538.6897
this is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	469.13867
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .	1185.8875
and with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music .	973.6399
compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent fifth symphony	1000.4379
or the love for three oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , the stone flower .	754.33594
this masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people earthy , salty and humorous .	794.364
of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .	661.51434
the early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience	901.01
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .	452.75305
however , in all of prokofieff ' s music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature ' ' -- his craftsman ' s attitude .	490.62784
prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .	446.50198
in orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .	764.14954
his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .	923.81226
his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .	5344.494
his counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .	720.40155
also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required .	1343.5826
that prokofieff ' s harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original ' ' than we prefer to believe .	383.83746
need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .	716.80774
prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .	545.8735
at this date , it seems probable that the name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history , as an effective traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose	417.40247
yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics .	699.7266
certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the western world -- not his experimentations .	714.91187
so prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them .	739.6942
nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .	337.17578
his fellow-countryman , igor stravinsky , certainly did not .	953.45264
why did prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? ?	2488.618
i think the answer is to be found in prokofieff ' s own words `` the clarity must be new , not old ' ' .	125.52144
when prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose ' ' , he shaped his talents to his purpose .	526.26166
when stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures .	841.1916
prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas .	205.65903
but stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting .	233.43547
in all his miscalculations , stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers ' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments .	1126.131
because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant petruchka , his savage sacre du printemps , his incisive les noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .	1782.8774
but time is running out , and many of stravinsky ' s admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma .	1028.3706
his various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself supra-expressionism , neo-paganism , neo-classicism , neo-romanticism , neo-jazz , neo-ecclesiasticism , neo-popularism , and most recently , post-serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ! !	2163.2676
what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! !	4047.1335
meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist	4290.897
a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem ( the star-spangled banner )	11870.777
a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto	20425.97
his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular american commercial songs ! !	758.71893
stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home .	792.04205
prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .	1115.0404
in the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose .	1108.5123
with a large and circumspect 20th-century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children ' s fairy tales -- slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large .	876.28217
of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him	365.2646
symphony orchestras , opera and ballet companies	1509.67
it must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose .	1117.0249
thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced one of the great composers of the twentieth century .	307.59326
that his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it .	318.3226
that he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture	622.01776
and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-century evidence of the effectiveness of evolution , based on a broad traditionalism for the creative art of music .	590.0814
april 10 marked a memorable date in new york ' s musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states .	243.71751
on that date the musicians emergency fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary .	1544.3533
roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell cotman .	1551.1046
and like this english master , mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them .	935.69763
as a boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods .	765.2945
his father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature .	1207.4003
out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that roy first painted subjects he knew best hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape .	909.45996
it is this subject matter that has brought mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors .	1935.4215
mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .	968.59204
like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures .	483.62195
but it did teach roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia .	715.55646
on the death of their father , they returned to their home in batavia , new york .	289.46545
after more years of concentrated effort , roy and his brother max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .	1034.8116
during all this time roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods .	584.44696
gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions .	386.395
but even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! !	1402.8813
except for a rich friendship with the painter , chauncey ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- roy developed his art by himself .	884.181
in the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint .	245.83595
he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium .	489.80853
gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique .	702.86
it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of batavia .	1095.0979
more often than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .	939.4741
what i have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form	905.5243
color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition	1390.0233
and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the mason stylemark .	1673.0487
finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .	1415.7686
but for the technical fact , we have the artist ' s own testimony	166.8942
`` of late years , i find that i like best to work out-of-doors .	158.6714
first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately af inches ) in which i pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns .	614.3356
if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , i try to place them in the initial sketch .	190.37689
for me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose .	492.35623
`` i am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him	2431.0005
as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .	414.39346
just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition .	335.17282
if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result .	1224.6825
out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which i call clicking .	626.1769
`` speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .	937.4729
`` if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , i mean to project equal concern for color .	226.75227
often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .	519.2639
when this occurs , i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field .	163.74292
`` when working from one of my sketches i square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal .	2892.716
when this linear draft is completed , i dust it down to a faint image .	495.3226
from this point , i paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage .	804.8744
however , first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines i have described .	846.04205
then i plan my attack the parts i will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .	494.2602
the longer i work , the more i am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important .	218.08446
trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .	876.17773
`` as for materials , i use the best available .	106.6628
i work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain .	1438.8463
in my studio i work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes .	762.15967
i have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an english make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight .	3686.3103
after selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water .	3447.0142
then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .	730.1826
`` in addition to the usual tools , i make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes .	947.2638
the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist .	430.64362
i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio .	1693.6171
`` my brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for i combine the sable and the bristle .	1214.271
the red sables are 8	7869.035
two riggers , 6 and 10	415.76608
and a very large , flat wash brush .	1803.422
the bristles are a fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge .	4768.0933
`` my usual palette consists of top-quality colors alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , french ultramarine blue , winsor green , hooker ' s green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , payne ' s gray , charcoal gray , davy ' s gray , and ivory black ' ' .	3598.1743
in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here .	1135.7332
true , a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory .	908.42615
unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist ' s pictures are full of atmosphere and climate .	464.6704
long observation has taught mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights	1376.8235
a middle distance often containing the major motif	3291.4043
and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky .	4285.904
in following this general principle , mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .	1138.2423
when painting , mason ' s physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind ' s eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .	420.1019
he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject	923.0742
rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .	271.35474
it is for this reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .	1345.3668
his pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale	753.7768
they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people .	284.357
by dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , roy mason has found a particular niche in american landscape art .	1249.7301
living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all .	864.2419
the artist was born in gilbert mills , new york , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to california , he lived in western new york , in batavia .	406.55472
when i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march 15th , i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist the water sign of pisces ( february 18 thru march 20 ) .	829.82416
and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again , in his natal month of march ! !	357.63614
over the years , beginning in 1929 , mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals	2876.2578
two ranger fund purchase awards	20967.352
the blair purchase prize for watercolor , art institute of chicago	673.236
and others in buffalo , new york , chautauqua , new haven , rochester , rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the laguna beach art association ,	971.9037
he was elected to the national academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first ranger fund purchase prize at the academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to academicianship in 1940 .	1052.5917
other memberships include the american watercolor society , philadelphia water color club , allied artists of america , audubon artists , baltimore watercolor society .	1039.4419
the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts in the 1960 olympics for one reason -- they were better .	390.8587
they were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers .	593.7404
our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance .	318.0583
the russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .	1468.9878
but why gymnastics at all ? ?	58.48955
and is the sport really important ? ?	433.0843
after all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics competition .	510.03333
but if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ?	148.9492
it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .	699.74866
taking first things first , let ' s understand the sport called gymnastics .	642.4409
it is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work .	1850.5403
the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in american gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games .	667.69775
the parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .	2631.7224
but the russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance .	612.6158
the gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .	564.2306
in short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well .	332.95352
the addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .	795.63245
another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .	194.21368
( an enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days .	531.3648
most europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries .	6058.1274
) in most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him .	378.91995
the american is very lucky if he has three .	388.7001
if a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools .	451.73178
first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .	1795.3284
oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty .	241.66861
certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .	1339.0569
russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800 , 000 competing for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team .	560.33673
eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .	239.17584
we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .	1217.9417
and what has dancing to do with all this ? ?	114.44296
russia ' s young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .	2983.845
well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic contest .	804.2533
american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons .	1502.8052
they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .	3760.6584
they were further stripped of old wive ' s tales by seeing the slender , lovely russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle .	2453.9827
president kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation .	1809.2083
if we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it .	547.52783
to be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance .	472.72644
if the dance teachers of america make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead .	342.66568
school teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators .	791.91284
there should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it .	669.3041
they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .	601.47815
dance teachers can respond to president kennedy ' s request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .	347.8732
very little in today ' s living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility .	358.33243
they often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength .	486.49716
ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing .	584.34216
even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas .	90.31452
this isn ' t surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in america cannot chin themselves once , and that english school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) .	1413.9497
the only area in which american boys hold their own is the baseball throw .	798.0212
for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended .	2197.552
it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .	226.66266
those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it .	1046.824
those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down .	312.18744
when they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up .	561.8524
parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .	170.59628
arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick .	704.9769
keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm .	353.8448
after this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher .	1706.3086
follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .	458.70114
push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first .	349.90753
start on the knees in a large circle .	136.78923
fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor .	160.56934
do this exercise six times each class period .	713.7255
as strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward .	1154.7698
start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out .	349.2461
try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands .	616.825
the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .	551.65796
let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down .	619.7934
five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .	463.16196
handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength .	374.60452
of course those who have developed more will find them easier .	494.13245
start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle .	319.22687
at first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help .	505.0546
drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .	510.9778
the left will follow at once .	207.95262
the right will land first , followed by the left .	139.13164
care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible .	288.9158
this will prevent flat falls and toe injuries .	1469.8876
bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .	846.39795
eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg .	552.30853
the child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles .	1759.1837
be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time .	405.57733
the backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results .	566.3803
have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent .	4913.2363
place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders .	616.5054
arch the back upwards to make a bridge .	161.66725
be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling .	702.08014
as flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher .	512.70337
later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .	2421.202
to further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle .	1080.2108
place the hands in front of the chest .	79.808044
keep the legs straight and the toes pointed .	560.85504
straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back .	339.6027
at the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head .	543.15247
improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .	1042.3678
the last essential to the beginner ' s gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll .	798.7353
this used to be part of every child ' s bag of tricks , but few children can do it today	327.49896
some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .	1322.1552
for most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can .	1465.0851
after it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) .	634.626
he places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest .	234.14738
he then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over .	694.5442
one or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo .	796.9838
if , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed .	383.66672
when the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis	793.4191
then no matter what happens , the child ' s performance will be controlled .	217.70595
by lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded .	420.36584
these are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) .	1638.9431
even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity .	421.20615
it is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative .	399.74338
and dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .	591.7069
every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics .	450.4543
we have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry .	656.79596
the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .	874.5523
when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .	1805.6678
the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities .	816.07666
the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .	728.1475
we use the term `` bio-medicine ' ' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .	381.71982
electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine .	473.9554
recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis .	11956.569
commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices .	2682.55
in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow ' s commonplace equipment originates .	1058.5864
from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research .	652.34973
many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .	796.39874
this stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside .	765.5963
a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv system to view the results .	795.68665
fig . 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical electronics center of rockefeller institute .	1308.8489
by combining the talents of a medical man , dr . aterman , a biophysicist , mr . berkely , and an electronics expert , dr . zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .	557.62177
three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources .	1128.4951
these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror	1021.2206
the specimen is magnified by the microscope .	104.9694
instead of the observer ' s eye the image orthicon in the tv camera does the `` looking ' ' .	637.5484
the microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .	799.4585
the video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen .	1574.2551
( note because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor .	3025.664
this assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry .	5606.4116
) this is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-tv system which preceded the present simultaneous system .	2105.0627
three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube .	12671.833
the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths .	929.9321
many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum .	1197.6569
different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .	1467.9193
where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail .	1503.9945
at the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .	1606.2034
the medical title of `` lobar ventilation in man ' ' by drs . c . j . martin and a . c . young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .	307.8929
at the university of washington medical school , the electronics group has developed the `` respiratory gas analyzer ' ' shown in fig . 3 .	459.38803
this unit , affectionately dubbed `` the monster ' ' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient ' s breathing .	362.8374
in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other .	958.2136
usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position .	1572.6307
from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .	2395.6897
the original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today ' s techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat .	644.543
for many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed .	546.3943
a group of researchers at the university of washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques .	520.71545
one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched .	511.83328
a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .	1103.7695
sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .	1152.3643
the travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second	6711.193
thus it takes about 16 msec . to traverse 25 mm . of tissue .	1289.4021
a sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation .	5783.838
in addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .	690.0086
the doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .	696.07825
a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself .	260.36926
it uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream .	2141.4697
the latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .	382.263
it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart ' s left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself .	337.12094
this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made .	322.61072
a simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in fig . 2 .	189.70813
outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder .	2208.9407
from this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .	333.42398
several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .	1269.6932
this original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm . in diameter .	914.87164
battery life limited the use of this `` pill ' ' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .	413.25488
a refinement of this technique has been described by drs . zworykin and farrar and mr . berkely of the medical electronics center of the rockefeller institute .	919.34534
in this novel arrangement the `` pill ' ' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer .	727.22906
as shown in fig . 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc . bursts .	1183.4272
the energy received by the `` pill ' ' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring ' ' on after the burst and this `` ringing ' ' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill ' ' .	226.46646
these frequencies are amplified and detected by the fm receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill ' ' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .	820.5805
one of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill ' ' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .	239.35005
applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .	1494.1494
one of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body .	456.2956
our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects .	882.6506
various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water .	1644.3169
in medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar .	623.5233
because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels .	3040.97
bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .	739.79724
based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through ' ' human organs .	451.12
a good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by dr . g . baum who has explored the human eye .	1009.8858
he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .	6635.201
the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in fig . 6 .	903.33685
the transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown .	353.92477
for display , dr . baum uses a portion of an af , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record .	496.5658
a typical `` sonogram ' ' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in fig . 5 .	91.78162
the frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc . and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter .	3456.221
the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into ' ' all corners .	616.0032
the total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period .	3301.9902
drs . howry and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results .	912.097
by submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in fig . 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights .	373.36105
as mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in fig . 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .	344.69666
arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls .	1166.7806
a cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in fig . 8 with the various parts labeled .	611.2525
oersted ' s boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life .	838.61633
he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august 14 , 1777 .	1193.9437
his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school .	986.9063
the two older boys , hans and anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german	873.63617
his wife taught the two boys to read and write danish .	776.4341
other brothers later joined them for instruction with oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to bible reading , german , and danish in the informal curriculum .	825.2716
oldenburg ' s contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town ' s learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .	222.86351
from the town surveyor , hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects .	549.7602
the mayor of the town taught them english and french .	2475.0347
whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed on to each other	1511.8737
they read every book that they could borrow in the village .	115.89268
at 12 , hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science .	547.3299
his earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .	336.09018
in 1793 the brothers decided to enter the university of copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session .	919.33563
while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law .	279.96472
the brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt .	910.3242
they supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could .	1156.4244
so impressive were those serious years of study at the university that hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination	440.77658
there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .	318.78802
i lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error ' ' .	1061.7313
he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science .	1044.897
in this third year at the university , hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` limits of poetry and prose ' ' .	330.20862
he completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine .	844.6868
he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .	1251.9238
hans ' student days were at a time when europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america and in france , germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the continent .	780.55457
the new century opened with oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .	846.9612
he was stirred by the announcement of volta ' s discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis .	2339.9783
the following year he devoted to the customary `` wanderjahr ' ' , traveling in germany , france , and the netherlands , meeting the philosophers schelling , fichte , and tieck .	828.24524
he also met count rumford ( born benjamin thompson in woburn , mass . ) who was then serving the elector of bavaria , and the physicist ritter	2097.1929
these were oersted ' s main contacts in science .	187.2585
from gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` the first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .	358.34882
as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes i have invented , i have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in copenhagen i used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me ' ' .	338.684
oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left .	818.0918
with ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host ' s fertile but disorganized mind .	1432.6252
oersted remodeled ritter ' s notes into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france for its annual prize of 3 , 000 francs .	580.1225
the sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him .	1080.8461
in may , 1803 , ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy .	717.1551
he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries .	1034.0914
thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` leiden ' ' jar by kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile .	2505.6978
ritter proceeded , `` you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon .	645.88324
this we might well witness ' ' .	40.04349
ritter died in 1810 and oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .	453.3329
in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for the university ' s chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist .	439.95703
however , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in german and danish periodicals .	1217.4823
in 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .	1364.8113
during oersted ' s attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences .	336.49875
he was , however , fortunate in his contact with prof . j . g . l . manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` lion pharmacy ' ' in copenhagen where oersted assisted him .	409.95212
manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted ' s disposal during and after his graduation .	437.20963
in 1800 , manthey went abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy .	854.4852
in february 1801 , oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead .	1141.3597
in the following year , 1803 , oersted , simultaneously with davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts .	1811.7732
eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing ' ' .	370.5416
he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .	1003.6837
the university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .	616.73553
his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him .	771.55975
his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .	453.30176
the years 1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again , but on this visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .	399.73138
in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in german and this was issued in french translation ( paris , 1813 ) under the title recherches sur l ' identite des forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .	1039.2362
his interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated .	1422.7826
chapter 8 , is entitled `` on magnetism ' ' and in it are included such remarks as , `` one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces .	307.17407
the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison .	976.0357
it is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication	766.7764
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference .	581.44324
the form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .	630.2076
there , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism .	689.92737
but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it .	292.02023
one could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do .	1581.1884
it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by bruckmann and coulomb .	1940.7787
by that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces .	1424.2507
an attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such ' ' .	289.85883
his plan and intent were clearly charted .	1271.7552
oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions .	914.2166
in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship .	336.9808
he continued as a popular lecturer .	1603.534
he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .	902.7724
in 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm , one of the danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition .	864.98157
it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , lauritz esmarch , that oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow .	1005.58215
together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents .	965.25854
esmarch was among those who witnessed oersted ' s first demonstration of his discovery .	379.26416
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades .	1151.4327
electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles .	3316.9915
in the late 1700 ' s beccaria and van marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .	976.6735
beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic .	2753.3792
the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .	3220.7966
the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces .	699.354
oersted ' s own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .	1233.9941
the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of oersted ' s discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 .	445.76123
at this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .	1167.7085

not less than milligram but not more than 1 . 25 milligrams of additive per pound of body weight .	698.84436
additive should not be fed 72 hours before animals are slaughtered .	4825.7153
there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle ( 1 ) fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons	1491.7852
( 2 ) mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface	1888.6926
( 3 ) special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides .	813.99786
feed is put in with an elevator .	689.857
several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk .	560.9294
the selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference .	1028.227
no one material is best for all situations .	289.53793
selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem .	582.00714
animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk .	500.74374
these bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence .	191.70407
because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal .	455.5977
filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations .	1264.6014
all-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year .	460.70792
this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .	957.9633
marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs . .	770.6108
companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged r & d facilities , faster new product development .	1134.847
many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .	811.1554
given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	704.05707
based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .	524.323
there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years	3221.3772
there is every indication it will continue .	77.87065
frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers .	988.91925
despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer .	722.53656
here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target	964.4962
has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ?	426.39374
have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? ?	474.27576
have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? ?	1545.8585
average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions .	1328.2739
this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses .	405.99158
have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? ?	352.55975
need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties .	200.89302
there are two reasons for this .	67.73218
first , most products tend to become more complex .	235.54605
second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around .	1031.4105
providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product .	604.61884
too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .	1279.6632
good service starts with product design and planning many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one .	337.05295
proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations .	509.3028
have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ?	284.56235
in spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions .	302.74176
to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important .	569.0574
your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .	736.90045
many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer ' s dollar being spent on their particular products .	816.8144
has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying ' ' area ? ?	297.07257
the trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the southwest and far west , and from city to suburbs .	498.3762
these shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs . .	387.55823
have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? ?	800.8569
market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts .	1151.6151
we have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends .	779.72687
instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts .	506.7002
the change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .	1014.58405
have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? ?	1043.5614
in the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .	557.5359
as mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer ' s as well as the distributor ' s profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .	234.55302
average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .	2342.1506
moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on .	759.9793
if you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? ?	1677.9062
if private brand competition hasn ' t been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ?	250.88086
display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .	615.88983
it has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .	578.5749
how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? ?	1437.6812
if you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ?	905.34515
salesmanship is still necessary , but it ' s a different brand of salesmanship .	146.24738
have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ?	1188.9772
have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? ?	748.4482
are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? ?	1654.8871
some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes .	520.3044
no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .	497.58328
the use of bulk handling is continuously growing .	1912.035
computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .	980.78503
`` selective selling ' ' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .	503.3085
there may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .	860.66
do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ?	1001.24585
in your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ?	1191.392
will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ?	617.2687
in one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos . .	1506.5463
as a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .	3263.9597
distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .	416.72614
higher costs of advertising and promotion .	253.42575
from the manufacturer ' s point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .	187.86049
it is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition .	583.21423
how much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ?	421.7357
are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? ?	1568.0077
have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ?	401.7343
increasing tempo of new product development .	581.1998
practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon .	324.3353
will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? ?	332.03967
if competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store .	1978.375
on the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive .	775.4181
as markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger .	564.6128
is your r & d or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? ?	906.7929
are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with r & d people ? ?	403.8272
technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it ' s useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register .	442.67606
are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization	2165.875
who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs	435.69934
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ?	2020.8022
we have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn ' t make up its mind .	553.16785
there is a shortage of salesmen today .	322.81183
in the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .	331.8162
while many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training .	486.21677
nor has the training been enough in relation to the need .	251.7625
most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements .	700.5158
have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ?	1041.0372
has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs . ? ?	633.0625
with the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future .	242.05035
men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work .	1443.4148
the growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .	345.56064
does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ?	622.4474
does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ?	4051.0803
every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning .	1286.1501
`` hip-pocket ' ' tactics are going to be harder to apply .	340.51694
many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis .	553.7944
with greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can ' t switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically .	752.769
are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ?	600.411
we find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning .	2239.5542
are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ?	523.7093
do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr . ) marketing program ? ?	5576.258
the key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company ' s marketing problems realistically .	1492.8605
solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .	757.6477
if companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade .	677.21234
the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion .	1157.3181
the architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building .	320.3875
ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education .	888.99115
it is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .	1525.7905
the element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure .	1575.1569
this would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer ' s training .	1089.716
we may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject .	542.4846
the real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ?	500.75186
the american institute of interior designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course .	957.9263
an examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the national association of schools of art , and a further `` on the spot ' ' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .	562.38556
one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .	404.35785
the suggested course of the a . i . d . was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .	328.40363
obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .	1040.6332
without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer .	887.85535
to begin with , what is an interior designer ? ?	486.0304
`` the dictionary of occupational titles ' ' published by the u . s . department of labor describes him as follows `` designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television .	885.6561
makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes .	2046.5912
furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval .	759.0569
makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project ' ' .	1260.4012
in addition to this the u . s . civil service bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them .	795.4298
he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings ' ' .	325.52274
this seems like a large order .	452.81635
the interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .	1188.7611
yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it .	637.8269
and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .	449.92023
few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum .	169.35345
it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .	166.27779
the old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .	893.8167
yet even here many a problem is presented	425.88025
as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment ' '	479.10065
no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment ' ' .	488.57266
working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .	752.6434
it is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel ' ' of real interior design demands .	648.07086
unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .	364.21512
it is like medical schools in india where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon .	1148.532
instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .	1042.1885
thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .	181.7295
in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .	336.9377
but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .	2609.8206
consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .	779.39307
fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade ' ' .	316.67014
even the `` history of furniture ' ' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .	806.96265
here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .	290.5481
the professional organizations such as american institute of interior designers , national society of interior designers , home fashions league and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .	810.4413
certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .	290.96124
not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .	767.44214
participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .	123.803314
the largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .	713.86914
this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .	244.02519
the professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .	255.39526
this seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .	538.62933
in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to the schools .	1563.2589
that is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses ' ' in their membership requirements .	277.39923
when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .	1131.5012
long hard years of `` on the job ' ' training had brought them to their competence .	372.01297
the necessity of that day has long disappeared .	584.3656
there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .	655.843
it is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .	352.4989
the reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses ' ' has long since passed .	431.0436
no one can deny that these `` back door ' ' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .	828.3918
beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .	553.7455
it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students .	1020.7269
the local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .	791.41797
nor will the hack , the jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .	463.0405
only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .	891.5114
at the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art ' ' .	400.87952
this kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .	581.8398
we must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .	782.1048
considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .	1010.551
in all `` degree ' ' courses in interior design a number of `` academic ' ' or `` general studies ' ' courses are included .	161.84613
it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in english , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .	597.55286
the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .	244.9921
the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .	241.20847
one technical question of school organization comes to mind here .	435.44388
for proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate .	272.53244
since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .	1090.4031
indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all .	405.37122
the question , however , cannot be ignored for long .	188.95763
the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .	517.35675
most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers .	736.11975
one solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .	902.8201
it is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .	6996.8154
this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .	299.89017
only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .	566.38763
it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department .	902.61395
this , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design .	830.61676
in spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .	597.5364
there will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` national association of schools of art ' ' .	914.9427
independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .	675.2348
how long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ? ?	550.75745

if you have an annual or regular physical examination program , is it worth what it is costing you ? ?	1009.4221
consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program .	1380.6932
too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant .	642.7862
but even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider .	289.46667
how old is your working force ? ?	278.78616
in what section of the country are you located ? ?	181.93509
are you in a rural or urban area ? ?	516.1724
these factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .	521.9007
above all , don ' t set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will .	1409.7266
unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time .	1355.9834
aim to balance your employee benefit package .	2185.6042
some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere .	864.52344
if you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they ' re entitled to .	871.5973
encourage them to exercise their benefits .	441.84244
this can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers ' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command .	862.0761
some companies find a little imagination helpful .	5484.578
hallmark cards , inc . , kansas city , mo . , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` benefit bafflers ' ' , which it distributes to employees .	715.07446
m & r dietetic laboratories , inc . , columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe .	1208.0131
u . s . rubber company , new york , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits .	1004.1801
the blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs $227 . 72 .	1823.5574
have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically .	1617.7693
you may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .	3066.5251
check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .	676.2343
it can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .	1417.6168
also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field .	681.5953
this will mean that every time there ' s an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner .	547.7286
put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits .	344.67053
don ' t go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .	1596.5966
generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .	2491.293
in granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker ' s relation to the deceased must be to qualify .	261.10568
thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin ' s funeral .	799.2092
also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you ' ll probably never use it .	290.74738
coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .	3517.995
vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .	699.31537
if coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group .	261.85553
consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .	319.98718
make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .	828.07074
otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers .	6664.068
keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .	426.3254
and so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .	346.7029
make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan .	24792.81
younger men usually don ' t think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they ' re liable to change jobs several times before settling down .	1265.102
choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans .	7189.8076
there are two sides of a coin for this decision .	161.96179
workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .	2779.4954
and they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .	270.9172
a non-contributory plan usually won ' t pay off for the worker until he retires .	682.6091
thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .	263.89783
make sure you don ' t pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .	372.03033
these include leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .	7066.3013
consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant .	378.66943
it ' s usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .	627.56683
for example , the friday after thanksgiving can be substituted for washington ' s birthday .	655.23846
this reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .	4341.56
require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .	559.0248
consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .	3787.1692
latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .	322.95038
if a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price .	384.9616
if the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won ' t blame the concessionaire .	865.6946
check your cafeteria location to make sure it ' s convenient for most employees .	261.28027
you may save valuable production minutes with a change .	439.60556
spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .	512.3988
this will cut the expense of vacation replacements .	3463.543
and with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .	589.524
also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation .	1360.4385
you might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year .	496.16956
the long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .	685.6769
modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .	570.4005
the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .	243.23708
but with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .	543.2327
as the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports .	500.60242
sporting firearms change , markedly for the better .	553.0623
just as modern transportation has outmoded the early studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today ' s sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment .	1239.8846
the american firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms .	4720.2617
and millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today ' s hunting and target shooting .	849.6134
and due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water .	1406.78
present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .	1738.0496
unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year .	828.38477
close to two million game birds were harvested on 1 , 500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on state game commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season .	2628.8943
the shooting development program of the sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers ' institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers .	861.7897
the most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves .	795.6578
this has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the new york staff of the sportsmen ' s service bureau , and the saami shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .	290.40033
following the kick-off of saami ' s shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in washington , d . c . .	172.61438
the group known as the american association for health , , physical education , and recreation ( a division of the national education association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the national rifle association , saami and the american fishing tackle manufacturers .	451.32764
this meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the outdoor education project .	821.002
the outdoor education project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .	855.00854
the various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development .	380.46054
but with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average american man or woman .	597.6238
following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by oep director dr . julian smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs .	1010.4031
saami ' s financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .	310.1103
personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to outdoor education .	1214.176
considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .	909.751
in 1959 saami ' s shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .	870.63654
this program is now nationally known as `` teen hunter clubs ' ' .	468.2655
teen hunter clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the allied merchandising corporation .	917.9746
the first program was sponsored by abraham & strauss , hempstead , new york , under the direction of special events director jennings dennis .	1844.0044
other pilot programs were conducted by a & s , babylon , new york	1126.9178
j . l . hudson , detroit	3589.4758
other thc activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-tv stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .	1409.7307
saami ' s field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 teen hunter club activities which have reached over 40 , 000 enthusiastic young americans .	1765.1792
through the efforts of saami ' s shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few .	1146.3237
the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .	509.13937
while individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .	447.51358
help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .	642.5307
the american gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .	2410.4565
since saami ' s conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the shooting development program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .	677.8449
we trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .	1218.8741
are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? ?	308.62564
are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? ?	484.82697
is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ?	1386.3093
would you like to organize teen hunters clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ? ?	1999.6425
we were camping a few weeks ago on cape hatteras campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on north carolina ' s famed outer banks .	3420.0815
this beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .	946.6185
with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which americans are camping now .	546.10236
there were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , pop tents , baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .	2510.508
moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .	3243.6594
we saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long national seashore recreation area .	1372.6976
dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers .	434.96637
here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .	298.05246
camping is big and getting bigger .	1767.036
no one knows where it will stop .	88.63685
almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .	786.1722
you read various guesses on how many americans are camping .	693.6635
the number depends on who is talking at the moment .	259.13513
the figures range as high as 15 million families .	585.66833
i ' ve heard 10 million mentioned often , but i ' m more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping .	638.56
seven million families would total 30 million americans or more .	4551.8037
consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .	484.08664
harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .	491.31894
they are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .	980.454
the national parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .	755.7826
the national park service hopes by 1966 to have 30 , 000 campsites available for 100 , 000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present .	1899.8677
the u . s . forest service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 national forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .	1217.0516
they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .	987.8833
they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .	5157.1167
they come prepared for family fun because americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance .	1364.2089
there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .	983.0433
among them , according to the u . s . department of commerce , are ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .	116.166214
the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn .	131.67168
camping is family fun , and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .	195.81311
but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .	738.46747
here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .	176.9503
the american automobile association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 .	1715.2887
the aaa then splits it down this way $10 . 50 for meals , $9 . 50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous .	1846.4866
what does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ?	455.42804
the $9 . 50 for lodging they save .	6934.5444
because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10 . 50 food bill along with most of the tip money .	591.9809
the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can ' t either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .	1720.3516
where americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .	329.13492
long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .	458.4374
and even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .	1546.5721
it would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they ' re buying the comforts of home .	573.4921
home is the place to find the comforts of home .	166.1078
they ' re buying fun and adventure and family experiences .	601.51746
but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .	447.02835
this is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .	1103.689
today ' s campers want comforts , and they have them .	2540.7844
and this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .	830.0292
it ' s fun , and it ' s easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families .	300.79013
camp meals are no great problem .	207.85083
neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags .	4718.3354
neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .	624.8046
but there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .	708.74725
throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad .	426.06204
since the industrial revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed .	497.46445
there have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn ' t like it	615.9847
the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work	569.4928
and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions .	684.5387
there have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public ' s dissatisfaction and loss .	678.51495
this has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .	11832.338
the remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash ' ' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates .	875.95
but the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer .	314.4729
some men have no talent for or interest in management	706.209
forcing them into management can only create trouble .	599.7143
the old shop adage still holds `` a good mechanic is usually a bad boss ' ' .	417.92407
yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success .	2215.0361
labor fights to change its collar from blue to white .	1184.8309
all grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .	2927.0852
as several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world .	381.01025
what can be done for the `` individual contributor ' ' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ?	254.85973
he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside	257.42926
usually concerned about america ' s belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles .	387.22644
yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title .	435.85144
even the college professor in america has been affected .	163.95934
it is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills .	401.04068
this difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .	311.84283
this leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people ' ' .	121.78899
nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .	792.6843
so we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up ' ' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions .	368.01212
in the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page .	891.4366
first what title , what setup ? ?	1566.4391
among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of general electric .	1731.7211
this is not a mutually exclusive plan	12744.622
there is no one point in a man ' s career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward .	411.3069
further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path .	520.55505
it is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions .	1019.30035
actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services ' ' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities .	744.15894
also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man ' s recognition as a technical expert .	311.58585
as examples at ge glen b . warren , formerly manager of the turbine division , widely recognized as a turbine designer .	935.11914
the late w . r . g . baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the electronics division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant .	407.79654
harold e . strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period vp & gm of the measurements & industrial products division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the switchgear & control division .	1272.1519
in the ge plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers .	672.1047
these positions carry such titles as	1448.3691
westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist .	1057.0222
many companies have systems , particularly in r & d , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations .	456.9222
another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach ' ' .	822.33093
one company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels .	694.23926
there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks	11976.449
the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision .	629.0067
the second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision .	4161.2524
the expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level .	611.1071
the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels .	2478.9016
in this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere .	530.13306
this reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military .	412.6612
several other examples central and satellite	2462.2944
`` we have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer .	725.591
we have set up a central r & d department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants .	1278.9683
a separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs .	258.7495
part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management .	967.8173
these headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design	1430.4858
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions .	224.33742
these men are considered managers of engineers .	1839.7474
they must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product .	416.31342
`` we do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject .	507.40237
i suppose it is because we are just not big enough .	350.42682
we have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems .	928.19507
the only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by asme , aiee or aiche .	1942.4768
i am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability ' ' .	1154.7174
`` we have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either .	715.02203
one way to formalize this is in the job structure .	166.41231
we have these positions , which compare directly af	778.6486
`` above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of engrg , r & aj .	1567.7095
the latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side .	1110.4094
we have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but i believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president ' ' .	789.6173
approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons .	2070.9785
the highest position is known as a ' research scientist .	328.91293
this approach has not been entirely satisfactory .	843.22363
the primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society .	432.7274
scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it .	466.1582
we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important	1936.2606
and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' dual-ladder ' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions .	808.0269
`` a serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level .	1691.7219
with no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance .	472.57745
promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .	1228.9601
if no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel ' ' .	946.3085
`` we have two approaches for the technical man the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager	647.6822
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work .	934.76917
these are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige ' ' .	307.848
`` we have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan .	433.0525
the highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer .	1191.0482
the salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) .	947.7811
we also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer .	1096.0262
above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder .	915.9196
`` we also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence .	362.85226
these include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers .	287.3698
we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers .	878.53687
publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies .	496.8149
`` a recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for engineering .	410.3916
this function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff .	524.51404
salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management .	386.3692
additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit .	1144.7734
`` we presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center .	1117.9926
operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status .	517.4026
all scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member .	419.01736
the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community ' s acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field .	272.57623
contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly .	874.4939
`` these recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence .	408.7768
it is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .	579.29376
fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions ' ' .	252.4358
sixty miles north of new york city where the wooded hills of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there is a new home development called `` oakwood heights ' ' .	602.74634
as a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14 , 000 range .	660.6938
but oakwood heights is unique in one particular .	308.07047
its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point .	759.2524
this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state pipeline corporation , with principal offices in new york state .	1158.2876
its president is otis m . waters , partner in the law firm of timen & waters , 540-k chrysler bldg . , new york city .	1067.8678
vice-president is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter .	1040.8425
ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft distributors , inc . , newburgh , n . y . .	391.81656
the idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .	636.46216
not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u . s . and canada , even overseas , write to fueloil & oil heat to inquire if it ' s feasible and where it is being done .	307.43256
its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in new haven described by john schulz in the march , 1950 issue .	593.0461
this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .	656.65
rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .	249.15044
common complaints included `` mrs . murphy ' ' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` aunt minnie ' ' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .	500.4375
as a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution .	756.4074
a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at oakwood heights .	2090.6948
called a `` slo-flo ' ' meter it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles , a key individual being don nelson .	272.77634
tri-state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .	1021.8689
there ' s an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed by a lawyer .	887.88074
the earlier new haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .	691.6155
these have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others .	592.62177
in working out the practical legal conclusions president waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .	1274.484
it is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .	351.19662
to overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .	1354.6566
when a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to tri-state .	688.9464
for the central storage , tri-state buys one acre , buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece .	2471.3682
in other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to tri-state .	431.61725
how does tri-state get its revenue from this plan ? ?	904.66547
it leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position .	392.632
this first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years .	793.5277
the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties .	354.33865
on this first venture the central storage is 20 , 000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes .	471.11633
the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .	3637.9126
however , that is not all he has to do .	124.63261
he must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .	1359.9974
in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups .	20929.533
again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best .	507.00113
for this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor .	1216.855
the major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .	1147.4103
the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected .	639.30457
for example , the officials of poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .	1284.0176
the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets .	1294.4888
the public service commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations .	411.6447
several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out .	598.90155
they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies .	539.42053
the government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .	3271.0361
there must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity .	483.37732
for a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4 ' ' ' ' x-tru-coat , a product of republic steel corp . , and all lines are welded .	357.24072
they are laid a minimum of 24 ' ' ' ' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking .	573.0741
the meter is mounted high on the basement wall .	508.71396
its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons .	1462.0061
it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .	825.18225
ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters .	445.85645
he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .	947.0556
it would be pretty difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhoods , and that ' s an understatement .	350.1881
the job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .	1625.5244
but in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .	1084.4421
what does tri-state actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for ' ' stage ? ?	421.2692
it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company .	771.0651
it may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .	829.89185
this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully .	374.55685
but it ' s too early yet to go visit oakwood heights .	2089.8386
only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor ' s visit on june 8th	271.89447
the big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .	1234.711
a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit .	1567.6653
the oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .	361.50433
a primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and tri-state pipeline corporation deserves a very good mark .	980.0277
every year about this time national gargle your cooling system week rolls around .	8400.319
it pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .	332.14862
do it this way for the summer gargle	1494.5256
first , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer .	1981.312
don ' t save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent ' ' type .	442.82428
the word means it won ' t boil away easily , nothing else .	688.6018
the rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don ' t want to risk the rust that two years ' use could mean .	254.51944
if a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner .	1583.1196
then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .	1806.4076
of course , you ' ll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .	573.9714
now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings .	7975.8823
next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again .	1044.0612
be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .	1018.41614
use the air hose for this job .	103.08986
check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .	197.78506
if you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` dowguard ' ' be sure to check it .	614.788
dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .	243.37039
check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .	403.99728
take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer .	2347.1548
don ' t let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .	7626.5083
spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .	1159.2418
the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators .	2455.3582
if you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat .	856.74304
the thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant .	594.6553
are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?	476.34778
there ' s a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .	826.7522
have a talk with your insurance agent .	1430.3672
be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money .	784.1086
first go over the type of coverage you now have .	634.96204
look for these features which may mean you can save	191.41295
avoid doubling up on the same item .	127.58453
for example , don ' t pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy .	278.57074
does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ?	3703.3545
this means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .	626.0264
this applies to repair work of winter storage .	492.51498
the figure five is important in insurance .	744.5174
with many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .	1546.4418
this means either cars or trucks .	399.23953
discounts run up to 2% of cost .	430.00937
usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .	1565.4072
for example if your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made .	2865.3967
in the period since the end of world war 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field .	399.04578
the importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone .	250.28403
designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries .	736.24756
many of today ' s developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays	2063.663
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers	2629.921
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc . , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics .	795.4063
there is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .	380.66666
the concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p . 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved .	767.8807
according to a recent wall street journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales .	1302.5312
five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing .	583.7059
and it ' s far from the end for plastics .	240.5667
industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960 ' s will be of plastic construction .	477.3883
evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , calif . .	439.26987
four years ago , the company ' s entire line was devoted to neon signs	459.8522
today , 85% is in plastics .	556.1021
from the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive .	277.47543
aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million .	2446.2205
currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components .	1293.5664
why the trend to plastics ? ?	2129.0327
what accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ?	271.24982
out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important 1 .	293.0012
plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication .	1811.1556
according to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit .	1152.9254
a 3-by-6-ft . plastic sign weighs about 120 lb . , compared to 275-300 lb . for neon .	3228.99
the weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping .	1702.1788
the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed .	2911.524
finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs .	3109.2273
they offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer .	789.15546
vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics .	3241.603
pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry .	530.6799
plastic signs work around the clock .	116.87573
internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night	726.55115
during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest .	915.80914
advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs .	3585.3396
among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .	1958.4607
for outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture .	2094.0933
at present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total .	1155.1057
( see panel , p . 166 , for a comparison .	217.31453
of interest is a recent announcement by du pont ' s polychemicals dept . of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as monocite h 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry .	1181.8082
sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow .	1749.1907
its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to du pont .	1249.207
cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties .	1638.4874
its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors .	1075.7665
new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color .	844.7114
thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign .	1537.5631
( see mpl , mar . 1961 , p . 98 ) .	430.21936
for specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc . , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used .	3395.0396
a relative newcomer in outdoor signs is mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) .	1719.757
for outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited .	527.3388
here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene .	7681.333
the final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit .	808.49365
often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques .	2758.895
one of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance neon sign co . , los angeles , and industrial electric inc . , new orleans , la . .	985.6563
the essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within .	1243.2491
with the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light .	1127.0786
also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign .	716.32324
the copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process .	2183.321
the film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required .	615.1065
spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another	1546.2911
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip .	135.2526
panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .	324.11716
signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way .	208.4026
it is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use .	1264.3253
trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions .	685.4307
as used by industrial electric inc . , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters .	624.63806
thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces	6024.131
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .	784.0914
in this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media .	2028.5375
recently industrial electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign .	1297.3375
comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit .	735.7169
the triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec . of viewing time for each poster subject .	1201.7421
sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft . wide , make up the 25-ft . length of the sign .	1848.614
perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs .	413.3609
signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters .	227.71902
frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc . .	412.4625
the huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them .	1007.82294
here are some of the newer items currently available	1602.4159
poster products inc . , chicago , ill . a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock .	1579.9697
the background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely .	1964.7032
the adaptaplex co . , beaverton , ore . letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black .	1409.7474
ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel .	1481.7084
for large letters , e . g . thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques .	395.32574
for example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in . and six 36-in . red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background .	2489.7112
the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb . each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters .	1260.3303
stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .	1639.4097
for mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels .	1200.9973
large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .	1297.6605
wagner sign service inc . , chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches .	254.83008
they are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of tenite butyrate .	2825.352
also available from this company are snug-grip plasti-bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material .	3551.557
made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft . , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters .	841.5121
still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by merritt products , azusa , calif . .	1877.737
this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in . ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0 . 080-in . clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side .	1507.0527
finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0 . 025-in . aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces .	978.9138
the sheets are extruded of tenite butyrate by jet specialties co . , los angeles , calif . .	649.94867
on large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e . g . right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate .	1489.8296
joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft . high and of unlimited width .	1969.5199
letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways .	273.10794
don ' t build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out	273.2778
don ' t insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit	841.32513
position your components before you close them in .	821.12805
don ' t wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances .	1466.2914
it ' s a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place .	885.02167
set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom .	121.43299
don ' t try to wrestle a 400-lb . tub af through a narrow doorway .	4143.3613
finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) .	1935.1556
finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .	1584.9718
there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished af closet .	781.83856
don ' t position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction	7580.1084
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window .	600.22095
you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side .	367.2685
install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling .	1463.2175
don ' t close in your house until everything has been carried in .	510.9391
last wall bob schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage .	455.34644
that way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .	4697.0234
no auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block .	697.7046
and trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out .	1214.2328
new rule no . 3 rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you	1897.959
this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because 1 .	1209.9938
it makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside .	947.2087
it makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 .	1493.1958
it changes the answers to `` who should do what , and where ' ' ? ?	52.160755
it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper .	1505.0577
it changes the answers on when to do what at the site .	177.4292
for example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .	1074.0515
instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) .	662.63416
it changes the answers on builder-dealer relations .	2165.6301
not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct ' ' and short-cutting the dealer .	640.88226
but now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc . .	742.9332
says clarence thompson `` we dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself ' ' .	887.3195
the revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .	1238.6602
the revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done	358.4314
five years ago a house & home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealers ' research council reported unhappily	3219.6267
`` only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads	1425.4736
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads	1082.1946
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads	2160.0146
only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads .	519.6317
`` so from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing ' ' .	786.23065
`` that house & home round table was the real starting point for today ' s revolution in materials handling ' ' , says clarence thompson , long chairman of the lumber dealers ' research council .	406.06265
`` it made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .	817.2687
before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem ' ' .	528.5041
here is where things stand today	3166.2725
almost all of the 3 , 000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year ' s new houses are mechanized .	1317.8022
there are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it .	1051.7292
practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles .	4894.8003
truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .	4911.409
for some significant new items see the pictures .	835.99243
more than 50% of all lumber is unitized	2215.9001
an nlrda survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling .	4284.0117
of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost .	1998.2175
most of the others will swallow their $ . 50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer .	1449.523
`` with a 15 , 500-lb . fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $ . 30/mbf compared with $1 . 65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time ' ' , says james wright of aj .	1156.2336
lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48 ' ' ' ' wide by a nominal 30 ' ' ' ' high ( or six mccracken packets 24 ' ' ' ' wide by nominal 7 ' ' ' ' high ) .	669.3954
these units make it easy to load as much as 48 , 000 bd/ft ( say 120 , 000 lb in a 50 ' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars .	2143.8442
the railroads have responded by adding 20 , 000 more box cars with doors 12 ' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars .	2285.0337
first was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40 , 000 lb	389.03574
later came a 1961 cut on the west coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $ . 07/cwt on 70 , 000 lb-plus carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70 , 000 lb .	1083.316
more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and nlrda studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type 6-b floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $ . 054/mbf .	3058.1873
for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper .	1755.3042
this costs from $ . 75 to $2 . 30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .	421.1497
these carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder	297.02948
says nrlda ' s james wright `` since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer ' s other equipment ' ' .	694.64984
the reason today ' s components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper .	1408.5763
so manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier .	844.57446
it cuts the lumber dealer ' s cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading .	307.63287
and it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder ' s high-priced labor to help unload it .	448.99734
says wright `` our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years .	434.78204
and most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles ' ' .	198.78407
restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for	349.11273
half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip .	659.53577
even `` america ' s most efficient builder ' ' , bob schmitt of berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2 , 000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works .	1013.42413
already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion .	3605.9688
builder eddie carr of washington , past president of nahb , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` scr masonry process ' ' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the structural clay products research foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less .	2082.0295
a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43 . 50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7 . 50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages .	3143.0562
the scr process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day .	1610.7754
one good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew .	559.10156
reports jim lendrum `` by studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .	580.07983
we found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don ' t make two teams	1182.4542
they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper team .	16107.731
we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number ' ' .	156.87923
no house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled .	394.16513
don ' t waste any $ . 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $ . 03 a stud	2793.2253
this is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit .	10364.15
green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum .	919.0245
but now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels , green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford .	1818.7924
green studs cost about $ . 65	1921.6798
dry studs cost less than $ . 03 more .	1255.2402
so if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds , the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud .	3103.48
there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone .	78.55767
not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance .	591.5503
if you ' ve travelled in europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you ' ve had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic .	479.3662
following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new .	544.9695
however , after you ' ve seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of europe , you ' ll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places .	436.50473
the champagne at troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour d ' argent .	948.9664
you can relive history and follow , in fancy , the crusaders in their quest for the holy grail as they sail out from brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of italy ' s boot .	858.2265
and you don ' t meet the folks from home in northwest spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the middle ages .	796.4865
time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea .	8156.4717
they ' ve been there since the days of the moors and the saracens .	644.9024
and what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman ' s village on the mediterranean ? ?	639.5766
an almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road .	338.47137
for those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .	673.90955
then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car .	310.8664
the answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one .	860.8988
almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you .	333.4346
you can call one of the car rental services directly ( hertz , avis , auto-europe nationalcar rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well .	1145.8909
with few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost .	1400.5848
you can wait , of course , until you arrive in europe before renting your car .	522.1128
the disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all .	314.9666
since charges are relatively the same , reserving a car before you leave for europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it .	605.70294
for those who plan to travel to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home .	314.05765
at some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries .	726.9136
international touring documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data .	812.96686
a valid american driving license is accepted in all countries except portugal , spain , yugoslavia and eastern europe .	1832.2167
if you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your international driving permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3 . 00 .	655.3738
your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , theft , liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries .	1693.9579
if you would feel happier with full collision insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance .	510.88354
the average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1 . 00 a day .	631.6863
the charge is variable , however , and goes as low as $ . 50 a day in ireland and as high as $2 . 00 a day in greece .	215.33362
rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of europe .	111.18007
there are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available .	297.1869
as in the united states , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week .	834.99084
it drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days .	7921.0547
it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $ . 80 to $ . 90 for the equivalent of a united states gallon and while you might prefer a familiar ford , chevrolet or even a cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller european makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon .	792.7134
your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group .	438.99203
with the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation .	856.80273
there is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn ' t all that much greater than for the wee sedans .	715.949
the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages .	634.24603
there is the free intra-city `` rent it here , leave it there ' ' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or your hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services .	1026.5125
a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits .	941.92316
the investigation will be well worth your time .	553.4409
all model cars are not available in all countries .	197.02094
quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country .	449.53784
if you would like to start your tour in italy , where the rental fees are actually the lowest in europe , fiats in all sizes are available , as are alfa romeo giulietta models .	1419.5947
if you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only $1 . 26 a day plus $ . 03 a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station wagon , seating six , at just $1 . 10 a day and $ . 105 a kilometer .	1565.7178
if you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn ' t all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $ . 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $ . 30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon .	1010.21906
with six in the group , the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee .	364.1363
in the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3 . 00 to $3 . 50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7 . 00 and $8 . 00 a day for the larger , luxury european models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $ . 03 and going up as high as $ . 12 .	526.7791
the same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven .	445.09048
the variations are not too great .	464.6602
rates for american cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8 . 00 a day up to $14 . 00 a day for a chevrolet convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models .	477.6679
rates in greece and finland are fairly high , actually the highest in europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in ireland .	500.98184
if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to lease a car .	429.42398
the actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car .	210.54602
you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout europe .	1175.8701
further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip .	1217.5056
there is a fairly wide selection of models of english , german and french manufacture from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 , citroen 2 cv , volkswagens , renaults to the 6-passenger simca beaulieu .	1963.9248
leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory .	519.1092
after the first month , rates are considerably less , averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models .	2087.2007
there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan .	537.5076
for one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road .	526.98364
then , too , european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them .	1518.4352
still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car .	249.37102
the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car .	2655.4285
it isn ' t as expensive as most people believe it to be .	392.19135
your chauffeur ' s expenses will average between $7 . 00 to $12 . 00 a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800 .	2806.7063
the big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed .	532.0567
since most european cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than american cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large american cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .	1036.6705
the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars .	707.68243
however , whether you arrange to have a european or american model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10 . 00 per day per passenger .	638.0858
this will include your helpful , english-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day .	884.74146
if you drive greater distances than that , you ' ll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands .	1191.4539
of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you ' ll have a memorable tour , but it won ' t be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you ' ve had a winner in the irish sweepstakes .	524.9349
in american romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute ' ' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn ' t take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom .	612.02045
just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` i wish they were emeralds ' ' .	1795.7909
aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on .	349.27475
the way macarthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this af primary stresses on emeralds and wish	871.8351
note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness .	1616.6527
conclusions the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .	1404.0331
and the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .	2840.4448
in other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of english words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white .	858.43524
at this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture	818.98914
but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if macarthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo .	932.98474
to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .	1916.6522
the point -- quite simply -- is this words they might have had	293.62598
this basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by dr . henry lee smith , jr . , at the university of buffalo , where he heads the world ' s first department of anthropology and linguistics .	348.71143
a brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , smith began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named arthur , who never could make up his mind ' ' .	1013.66235
later , he became one of the central spirits of the army language program and the language school of washington ' s foreign service institute .	222.71521
it was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock ' ' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication ' ' .	273.27493
to the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history , socio-economic identity , education .	1203.3832
it is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .	459.83072
this , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy .	482.34512
in the early 1950 ' s , smith , together with his distinguished colleague , george trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of birdwhistell ( ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone ' ' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking ' ' with one ' s hands , et cetera .	717.16736
smith ' s first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone .	746.5341
for example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother .	542.5951
the usual u . s . norm would be af middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end .	644.80316
the symbols of mother ' s status , here , are all usual for culture u . s . a . .	68.245155
quite other feelings are evidenced by this style af note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence	405.24847
this is a `` fade ' ' ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother .	694.1618
even less regard for mom and mom ' s apple pie goes with af in other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated .	1059.4429
and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired .	380.01486
an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .	23958.92
with this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture .	572.6963
the joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .	451.00043
since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions in new research and training .	1260.679
some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940 ' s demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts .	752.6128
in a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words .	760.2936
at a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists .	796.0836
newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .	433.5275
by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist .	588.326
linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient ' s voice departs from expected norms .	2801.0747
it flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences .	1804.8733
interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient ' s vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist .	938.7271
his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient .	1402.7997
in one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , the first five minutes ) goes like this the therapist ' s level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you ' ' , which would imply disapproval	318.40472
or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people .	258.2018
the patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral	483.417
aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed ' ' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i . e . , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before .	582.0324
then she catapults into `` everything and everybody ' ' , putting particular violence on `` everybody ' ' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient ' s general style of speech up to this point .	276.2192
consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention .	308.11646
he may then very well conclude that `` everybody ' ' is probably not the true target of her resentment .	331.1228
immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` i don ' t feel like talking right now ' ' .	1325.2576
within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody ' ' truthfully refers to the woman ' s husband .	178.1854
she says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` i keep thinking of a divorce but that ' s another emotional death ' ' .	187.86757
the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence	544.5357
so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .	241.11336
by saying `` another emotional death ' ' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .	171.14307
this the therapist may pursue in later questioning .	589.92017
the phrase , `` emotional death ' ' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative ' ' .	591.6039
since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience .	270.44107
his own communication apparatus operated superbly , and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of dr . blauberman .	8826.106
interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques	1492.3401
almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .	432.392
yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what ' s wrong with him	545.55133
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .	2297.1406
naturally , the patient does not say , `` i hate my father ' ' , or `` sibling rivalry is what bugs me ' ' .	406.05972
what he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .	698.51685
some of the classic indicators , as described by drs . pittenger , hockett , and danehy in the first five minutes , are these ambiguity of pronouns	1611.9779
stammering or repetition of i , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .	497.92722
on the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean i or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person .	629.3376
the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used	240.12627
therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives .	194.12758
when someone says , for example , `` they took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me ' ' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made .	256.26358
( this patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty .	426.25732
) amateur linguists note here that pursewarden , in durrell ' s alexandria quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship .	694.43164
she was just another freighter from the states , and she seemed as commonplace as her name .	354.60638
she was the john harvey , one of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the u . s . fifteenth air force , to field marshal montgomery ' s eighth army then racing up the calf of the boot of italy in that early december of 1943 .	670.9423
the john harvey arrived in bari , a port on the adriatic , on november 28th , making for porto nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city ' s new and modern harbor .	549.23584
hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole .	7744.0825
if anyone thought of the john harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried .	624.51984
it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront .	1482.1324
for in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons .	1622.1228
throughout the early years of world war 2 , , reports persisted that the axis powers had used gas -- germany in russia , japan in china again .	478.72202
influential people in america were warning the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns .	1185.2107
some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first .	619.4255
to silence extremists , to warn the axis , president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august	738.47943
`` from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare .	1096.0425
i have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons .	619.94086
`` however , evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources .	884.96136
`` use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .	936.32513
this country has not used them , and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them .	97.792984
i state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies ' ' .	534.0571
the following month the invasion of italy was begun , and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern italy .	1182.8474
bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields .	389.11868
any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne .	172.09973
it would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below .	850.0633
so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey .	201.85555
a detachment of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under first lt . howard d . beckstrom went aboard , followed by lt . thomas h . richardson , the cargo security officer .	1189.048
only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks .	3672.163
thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at bari .	482.64655
it was the night of december 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in bari .	221.30132
it was getting on toward 7 o ' clock and the german me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit .	581.7627
capt . a . b . jenks of the office of harbor defense was very worried .	535.5288
he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in italy .	445.48224
on november 24th , they had made a raid on la maddalena .	796.80365
two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the me-210 had made its first appearance .	883.80286
after it had reappeared the next two nights , jenks went to higher headquarters and said	1176.7036
`` for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures .	734.26105
they ' re just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic ' ' .	339.94827
but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist .	10773.683
even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general peltz , the commander who would conduct the `` little blitz ' ' on london in 1944 , a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously .	450.99805
true , there had been raids on naples -- but naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast .	1831.4532
no , bari was out of range .	691.84436
more than that , allied air had complete superiority in the eighth army ' s sector .	1084.1682
so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him .	696.1287
for jenks knew that bari ' s defenses were made of paper .	226.98334
the royal air force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available .	3817.677
there were no r . a . f . fighter squadrons on bari airfield .	879.4862
the radar station with the best location was still not serviceable .	506.20346
and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command .	1497.9617
it had been made shockingly evident that very morning to ensign kay k . vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the john bascom .	1616.5963
a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped .	886.3828
then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers .	5487.131
`` this harbor is a bomber ' s paradise ' ' , the britisher had said with frank grimness .	593.77216
`` it ' s up to you to protect yourselves .	776.28156
we can ' t expect any help from the fighters at foggia , either .	895.57446
they ' re all being used on offensive missions ' ' .	705.8249
not fire until the bombs came down ! !	483.59406
he thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head .	4195.6616
like hell he ' d wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ?	1685.8604
what would his guns guide on then -- the north star ? ?	447.77374
ensign vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put seaman 2/c donald l . norton and seaman 1/c william a . rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette .	816.96515
below decks , seaman 1/c stanley bishop had begun to write a letter home .	994.1479
above decks on the john harvey , lieutenant richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy .	1222.9663
there were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible .	178.50583
bari was asking for it , he thought .	121.08261
for five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold .	487.34485
richardson wondered when it would be unloaded .	170.95956
he hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth .	331.96527
the burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men .	916.56714
lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs .	489.08548
they seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as bari .	756.9122
nine of them had gone down the gangplank already .	2202.0615
deck cadet james l . cahill and seaman walter brooks had been the first to leave .	894.54926
richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer ' s stock in trade .	1044.6647
the other half of the crew , plus beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard .	724.2681
richardson glanced to sea and started slightly .	966.8256
damned if that wasn ' t a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- porto vecchio .	1054.553
the night was so clear that richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette .	1387.6921
then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward .	2651.6086
it was a clear night and it was raining ! !	215.38312
capt . michael a . musmanno , military governor of the sorrentine peninsula , had also seen and felt the `` rain ' ' .	291.71448
but he had mistaken it for bugs .	1407.9995
captain musmanno ' s renovated schooner with the flamboyant name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the sorrentine ' s civilian population .	4985.1807
at exactly 7 30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face .	1064.7738
he turned the beam of his flashlight on it .	546.1984
it was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating .	634.46075
another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth .	3160.7395
it was `` window ' ' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers .	693.0601
musmanno bellowed to his italian crewmen .	15405.383
unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at bari .	3982.8577
they had come from airports in the balkans , these hundred-odd junkers 88 ' s .	3570.1663
they had winged over the adriatic , they had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill .	1057.3176
they had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares .	933.01105
and they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane ' s spotlight to guide on .	410.70444
after the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until british mp ' s shot it out .	1847.6906
in that interval , the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor .	1028.9309
merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss .	790.98975
the little unsinkable sank almost immediately .	1499.0835
captain musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft .	1802.8906
they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under .	1568.1207
john bascom went down early , too .	258.3008
ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets .	1193.3649
most of the junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs .	691.386
vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire .	327.42087
he was wounded , but fought on .	8430.85
norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors .	285.18964
bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one , three and five .	2670.8613
luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt .	1528.8907
the order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks .	992.2848
there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement .	1998.1346
you explain , `` i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before .	814.1481
i can ' t tell when , but i ' m positive i witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past ' ' ! !	176.89607
this experience will have happened to many of you .	223.0204
emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when ' ' .	733.84485
most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .	2876.5813
in this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually .	1411.598
when a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .	313.20462
occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .	4762.022
one day maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified .	1149.1176
rudyard kipling ' s scorn for the `` jargon ' ' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life film ' ' ? ?	828.4736
the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself .	428.36722
one day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` i want a word with you , please ' ' .	762.8451
at that moment kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier .	826.0295
freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .	643.20905
however , readers who accept freud ' s findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his interpretation of dreams , chapter 1	609.5231
as `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams ' ' .	310.9218
dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .	2357.5745
the basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .	505.7383
i recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town .	285.75986
i am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures i have seen .	1025.0953
and when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it ' ' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .	459.6558
skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .	1074.5273
the question becomes , `` what is a dream ' ' ? ?	44.290874
is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? ?	707.48816
every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .	518.42847
in most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects .	399.06955
but these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don ' t remember having seen in real life .	241.00656
for instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and , with photographic realism , sees smith driving the car	7898.7944
whereas , it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car .	296.1843
there is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams .	1449.8168
the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .	1162.6274
a `` mental image ' ' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension .	810.38184
dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .	1510.0192
as in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .	414.7491
but then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .	439.5716
the opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative perception , in the book philosophies of science by albert g . ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception ' ' .	405.4901
but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ?	478.07053
as retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location .	549.29376
hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness .	586.88495
modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy .	544.89777
we know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc . , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .	790.5625
so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies .	663.0763
this theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .	1196.0812
space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions .	244.75717
if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? ?	799.54395
it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future .	1707.9138
three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events .	1369.5253
the body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies .	348.95294
the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .	2898.2942
consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .	1021.0979
when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .	695.0477
if the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life .	384.38474
dr . h . v . hilprecht , professor of assyrian at the university of pennsylvania , dreamed that a babylonian priest , associated with the king kurigalzu , ( 1300 b . c . ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .	780.1739
as a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by dr . hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .	248.32788
some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest ' s information .	529.80554
dr . hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .	271.80774
he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite , and imagined it must have been german or english .	822.32355
we may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by dr . hilprecht ' s subconscious reasoning .	980.2245
but , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ?	1970.5673
which theory is more fantastic 1 .	718.7559
that the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor ' s brain , or 2 .	303.95172
that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met ? ?	1056.3527
the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vue feeling .	1001.8252
no doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper ' s mind .	936.37604
probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake .	12976.593
when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar .	609.7056
nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists .	871.7964
if deja vue is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people .	1526.3057
chauncey depew , one-time runner-up for the republican presidential nomination , was attending a convention at saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met .	496.2273
after the preliminary business affair was finished depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for roosevelt .	3914.3018
if depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue .	405.22397
but the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .	518.2396
he remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .	154.73334
one week before the convention , depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .	480.26468
`` the food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here ' ' ! !	111.82799
so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from north country school , lake placid , new york .	735.5338
in this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school .	324.69647
because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .	1312.169
when served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities .	706.8168
situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands .	442.3758
these contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight .	1036.632
from fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-september to june .	584.5222
the director , walter e . clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare .	340.3963
to him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind .	648.47296
the concept of good nutrition really began with the garden .	533.94025
the school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school .	175.14023
in a climate hostile to agriculture , mr . clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques .	226.28975
where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail .	1127.8684
throughout the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat .	12421.831
mr . clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil .	1201.2452
`` to give up these notions required a revolution in thought ' ' , mr . clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading `` organic gardening ' ' and `` modern nutrition ' ' in a search for help with his problems .	329.11533
`` louis bromfield ' s writings excited me as a conservationist ' ' .	838.0939
by 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray .	908.49384
he locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains .	312.48468
after reading `` plowman ' s folly ' ' by edward h . faulkner , he stopped plowing .	460.4668
the basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds .	893.23517
separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .	714.2117
all these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year .	2279.8423
it was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader .	5148.998
years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity .	1130.2081
soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this .	1158.3506
to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , mr . clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth .	443.09738
sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , `` this soil used to be like that hard packed road over there ' ' .	553.26013
`` people and soils respond slowly ' ' , says walter clark , `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program .	1264.8734
no chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used ' ' .	1518.7141
the garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar .	830.9103
the carrots sometimes don ' t make it through the winter	48.333675
the cabbage and squash keep until march or april .	1355.3938
there is never enough corn , peas or strawberries .	1429.7045
mr . clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future .	1063.2146
a new project planned is the use of bio-dynamic starter .	1355.8657
new ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment .	1608.9867
`` after the soil , the kitchen ' ' , says mr . clark .	47.775787
the first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread .	1558.8894
`` adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push ' ' .	247.59612
at first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves .	815.82806
`` you can ' t make french toast with whole-wheat bread ' ' , was an early complaint .	474.96262
of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better .	566.24585
mrs . clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering .	1024.9058
then miss lillian colman came from vermont to be kitchen manager .	492.546
today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread .	4407.7515
mr . clark ' s studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour .	484.31912
once the grains are ground , vitamin e begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week .	1125.7766
a mill stands in a room off the kitchen .	245.93842
surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state .	738.9719
miss colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor .	642.6247
she goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding .	397.89984
the bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma .	1555.511
it is well liked by the children and faculty .	116.4625
there is one problem with the bread .	101.5679
`` lillian ' s bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much ' ' , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds .	737.7805
the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at one time that was all they ever served .	400.0004
when the chance came , they first eliminated cold cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day .	1443.1202
they serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal .	337.19473
occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot ' ' .	1515.1328
at the beginning of the school year , the new students don ' t eat the cereal right away , but within a short time they are eating it voraciously .	334.42218
when they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal .	11658.396
the school has received letters from parents asking , `` what happened to johnny ? ?	650.3558
he never used to like any hot cereal , now that ' s the only kind he wants .	262.61465
where can we get this cereal he likes so much ' ' ? ?	136.24373
salads are served at least once a day .	214.94565
most come from the root cellar or from the freezer .	2330.1443
home-made sauerkraut is served once a week .	381.62122
sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey .	3069.4712
sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today ' ' ? ?	516.547
the school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs .	491.79266
lots of cheese made from june grass milk is served .	880.4139
hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .	616.1289
organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week .	850.98346
also , salt water fish is on the table once a week .	318.56235
for deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week .	661.58374
most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at least , sometimes at snack time .	1456.6937
dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed .	4593.326
apples come from a farm in vermont where they are not sprayed .	665.78577
oranges and grapefruit are shipped from florida weekly from an organic farm .	2249.2944
finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem .	469.7133
sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways .	2225.1704
following a talk by mr . clark at the new york state natural food associates convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from vermont .	810.6601
wheat-germ , brewer ' s yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves .	3521.167
miss colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables .	1004.7463
raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves .	217.94974
very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged .	354.50497
drinking with meals is also discouraged	38345.766
pitchers of water merely appear on the tables .	221.2283
the source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues .	1955.6666
the cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin c content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible .	1404.5929
since mr . clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons .	1963.8453
to solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains .	1495.1758
on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail .	851.9059
they learn to like these so well that it isn ' t surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time .	435.89468
they tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey .	608.0385
maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .	109.40462
this and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking .	1057.8079
parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts , but no candy .	547.5398
mr . clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs .	666.3988
the heavy meal comes in the middle of the day .	32.9026
soup is often the important dish at supper .	4420.6035
homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins .	852.3626
the school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality .	404.4466
the cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day .	460.01404
even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , mr . clark felt the school had a good health program .	347.92828
rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule .	318.74243
a vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking .	6487.2354
since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof .	779.4514
visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children ' s hair to bring out the sheen .	1351.3573
the ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment .	544.6684
buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond northfield gulf .	4308.279
wires whined as a cold november blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit .	2546.418
he peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below .	1897.3737
`` good old iron compass ' ' ! !	44.24783
a plume of smoke rose from a central vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights .	2646.8562
the girders of a shattered dog river bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream .	4595.8633
vermont ' s main railroad line was prostrate .	3718.0261
and in the dark days after the great flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state ' s history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the united states mails .	375.6902
rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of friday , november 4 , 1927 , when officials of the post office department ' s railway mail service realized that their distribution system for vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight .	1035.0021
clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail .	753.35535
the state ' s railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks .	3738.2317
and once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood ' s victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems .	483.4467
from burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across lake champlain to the railroad at port kent , n . y . .	645.55316
but what came in was piling up .	5204.484
the nearest undisrupted end of track from boston was at concord , n . h . .	295.41855
when governor al smith offered new york national guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing burlington ' s bottleneck and that at montpelier too .	618.79016
the question was `` where to land ' ' ? ?	43.88136
there was no such thing as an airport in vermont .	772.0419
burlington aviator john j . burns suggested the parade ground southwest of fort ethan allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned national guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged `` jenny ' ' and dehaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base .	2316.4248
the only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged montpelier was on the towne farm off upper main street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions .	1774.3607
over in barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone .	1118.9926
anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , granite city citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd infantry , vermont national guard , laid out runways on wilson flat , high on millstone hill .	2301.1333
the `` barre aviation field ' ' was set to receive its first aircraft the sunday following the flood .	201.95442
though the makeshift airports were ready , the york state guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule .	861.76996
they had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their world war 1 , planes .	1369.7957
it seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air .	1160.6904
they had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals .	4378.487
down in concord , new hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time robert s . fogg , a native new englander , had been a world war 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the concord airport .	486.9446
tall , wiry , dark-haired bob fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history .	3025.2979
piloting a curtiss navy mf flying boat off lake winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original rural delivery air service in america .	1424.7363
during the excitement following lindbergh ' s flight to paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes .	5623.601
in concord , bob fogg was the most prominent new hampshire boy with wings .	930.03723
public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map .	591.00305
the ship was a waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225/hp wright radial engine known as the whirlwind .	1028.2589
a trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long , the waco was entered to compete in the `` on-to-spokane ' ' air derby of 1927 .	1710.9086
as a matter of fact , fogg and his plane didn ' t get beyond pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers .	960.0893
so with all this experience , bob fogg was a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract .	962.6298
his work began just six days after the flood .	351.50525
by airline from concord to burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier .	958.61395
the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back of the state house when the wind was right , and used wilson flat above barre when it wasn ' t .	740.32025
between the unsafe towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory .	1790.1499
each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river .	1556.0443
`` but fogg ' ' , they countered , `` we can ' t get over there .	138.47816
and besides you seem to make it all right here ' ' .	73.98297
it took a tragedy to bring things to a head .	137.68675
after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field .	12594.005
sent to montpelier by secretary herbert hoover , red cross aide reuben sleight had been killed , and his pilot , lt . franklin wolfe , badly injured .	2118.0906
with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside .	1699.461
faced with this situation , postmaster charles f . mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of berlin .	783.3092
a long flat known as the st . john field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the winooski bridges were at last passable , they decided to use it .	315.72977
with a wary eye on the farmer ' s bull , fred somers of montpelier and mr . st . john marked the field with a red table cloth .	501.69714
as a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling .	1196.0863
with these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the waco , bob fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21 , 1927 .	895.18036
each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches .	8537.106
during the second week of operations , fogg received a telegram from the post office department , asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one sunday trip ' ' .	643.4624
since fogg ' s was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions .	1041.3901
over the weeks , america ' s first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation .	1361.4521
each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home .	2441.3193
always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer ' s boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them .	2355.4639
a sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit .	3396.7786
the airman ' s stock answer to `` weren ' t you cold ' ' ? ?	129.56651
became `` yes , the first half hour is tough , but by then i ' m so numb i don ' t notice it ' ' ! !	157.81664
as daylight began to show through the frosty windows , fogg would place a call to william a . shaw at the u . s . weather station at northfield , vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings .	466.2869
shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station .	676.42395
`` ceilings ' ' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions .	1147.8405
later on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank e . hartwell .	2379.723
out at the airport each morning , fogg ' s skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar .	3558.2898
( he ' d get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover .	1608.2358
) wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , bob fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition .	1336.7991
concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the whirlwind ' s exhaust overhead .	1314.5962
sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed .	853.2674
plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation .	763.5991
often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the winooski or the white river along the line of the broken railroad .	467.2112
when driving rain or mist socked in one valley , fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the ottauquechee up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes .	2713.0945
the dependable wright engine was never stopped on these trips .	627.7859
it ticked over smoothly , idling while fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen , and one from montpelier and barre at the st . john field .	1154.5385
sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs ' ' high over the clouds .	757.20056
there he ' d take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he ' d be over the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him .	450.53827
bob fogg didn ' t have today ' s advantages of instrument flight and ground control approach systems .	665.92926
at the end of the calculated time he ' d nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable .	498.44296
usually back in concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of mrs . fogg ' s hot broth before starting the second trip .	612.2925
day after day fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .	1346.375
the flyer had his share of near-misses .	2279.984
at fort ethan allen the ever-present wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated .	8602.341
once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved the engine and got the tail up .	1370.717
at a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream .	1435.1345
tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet .	493.1716
one afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , fogg took off for concord from the st . john field .	818.0918
if so , are you saying , `` where did the last few years go ? ?	658.53735
how did i get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?	310.4152
what do i do now ' ' ? ?	17.820843
yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly .	2584.276
somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire .	4228.9844
we always thought we would die with our boots on .	433.4566
out of the blue comes talk of pension plans .	11787.142
compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon .	1448.5349
still , it seems in the far future .	123.094574
suddenly , one day , up it pops ! !	701.44403
sixty-five years and you ' ve had it ! !	262.46918
you ' ve thought about it before in a hazy sort of way .	395.5141
never seemed as if it could happen to you	83.42748
how am i going to live ? ?	34.12184
what am i going to do ? ?	37.22713
where do i go from here ? ?	83.1331
a great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers .	1044.2812
are you one of these ? ?	47.633106
if so , you are of the old school .	75.07861
you are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose ends .	816.28687
everything must balance to the last penny .	6353.951
also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word .	502.62476
you never are late for work and seldom absent .	880.66077
actually , you can take no special credit for this .	266.86588
it is the way you were taught and your way of life .	277.38046
all this is standard equipment for a man of your day	211.17917
however , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing .	298.27582
your way doesn ' t seem to be so darned important any more .	259.4426
you realize you are getting in the old fogy class .	1463.9706
to put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded .	665.70544
the answer is a new era .	620.93134
now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and i . b . m . machines .	658.4852
the planning dept . comes into existence .	502.72495
all sorts of plans come to life .	285.0904
this is followed by a boom in conferences .	706.30133
when a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on .	2619.5706
the new way of life ! !	110.79595
you had your day and it was a good day .	84.40627
well , to get back to the problem of retirement .	183.50977
every retiring person has a different situation facing him .	592.44995
some have plenty of money -- some have very little money .	458.92584
some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids .	1224.9325
some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments .	651.93085
some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass .	437.67834
some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything .	257.02353
well , whatever you have , that ' s it ! !	92.68527
you ' ve got to learn to live with it .	141.48723
the question is `` how are you going to live with it ' ' ? ?	85.03515
you can sit back and moan and bewail your lot .	5181.974
but , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged .	833.20233
it seems to me , the first thing you ' ve got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be .	146.35439
make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life .	331.89294
one thing , i am sure of , you must get an interest in life .	126.53813
many of you will say , `` well , what can i do ' ' ? ?	65.054955
there are many , many things to do .	165.06895
find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl .	437.57693
if you can ' t think of a thing to do , try something -- anything .	178.66217
we are not all great artists .	457.55362
i , frankly , can ' t draw a straight line .	246.1145
maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? ?	1201.9265
you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it .	850.5587
anyway , i ' ll bet you have a lot of fun .	191.62993
do you like to sew ? ?	378.08667
does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?	1045.8904
do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? ?	4762.022
if you do , go to it .	142.16805
there is always a market for this line of work .	174.64793
some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work .	1334.4713
where sewing is concerned , i ' m a total loss .	100.14268
when you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and i have to sew them back on , or get out the safety pins .	638.0508
then again , there ' s always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs .	3969.858
not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you .	225.62778
how ' s about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? ?	2636.609
some people love to crack tile and it ' s amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time .	477.8515
how about the art of cooking ? ?	139.42871
do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? ?	2480.2434
there is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary .	2051.509
some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood .	336.48608
some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc . .	1029.1982
perhaps you couldn ' t do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? ?	226.59059
outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some dandy little gadgets .	447.1098
some women get a real thrill out of housework .	8809.658
they love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball .	707.9484
i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that ' s where it belongs .	698.5685
perhaps you would like to become a writer .	144.34346
this gives you a wide and varied choice .	696.96075
will it be short stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children ' s stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious ? ?	422.9202
ever since i was a child , i have always had a yen to try my hand at writing .	250.62355
if you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection .	823.72266
this is just being a normal writer .	322.52087
just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep on plugging , and finally you will make the grade .	579.9278
few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me .	585.86633
but , it could happen , and it may happen to you .	111.079384
then there ' s always hobbies , collecting stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires ? ?	2244.6487
i can hear some of you folks protesting .	6658.522
you say , `` but it costs a lot of money to have a hobby .	265.17892
i haven ' t got that kind of money ' ' .	94.718834
it does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free .	513.3176
how about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? ?	786.49835
also , there ' s scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you .	820.9574
it ' s getting interested in something that counts .	615.3687
as for me , i am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( i love puzzles ) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands .	1322.7776
so far , the covers have never been off the boxes .	562.16754
i just don ' t have time to do half the things i want to do now .	155.35303
so in closing , fellow retired members , i advise you to make the most of each day , enjoy each one to the n ' th degree .	746.7392
keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet .	573.7306
to one and all -- good days ahead ! !	503.4703
an important criterion of maturity is creativity .	514.33075
what does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ?	317.58942
when we turn to noah webster we find him helpful as usual .	2264.9153
`` to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power ' ' .	316.15533
we are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .	258.52756
thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a league of nations or , developing a mature character .	628.58154
all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .	542.1247
while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .	1021.3063
an animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .	6627.5107
man ' s great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .	837.41235
this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .	655.29376
it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .	728.7787
in our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne come into actuality .	874.1862
the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of 1941 .	1769.7404
in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man ' s projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .	312.6935
it is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his creator .	147.74907
not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .	536.66046
we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .	1405.669
we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .	475.96698
by this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .	191.11453
we must realize with prof . charles morris in his the open self that `` man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation ' ' .	783.79193
so far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .	736.4332
is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .	794.9263
is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? ?	985.62665
sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity .	626.29694
some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , victorian past	604.0342
that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation .	899.02814
perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance .	1533.3964
joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women .	924.2841
various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .	519.803
privacy must be highly assured both in time and place .	355.91043
that is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment .	786.4905
if the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other ' s arms will be bliss enough for these few hours .	798.45166
the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose .	556.15515
first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .	897.5414
one thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act .	1271.7874
ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion .	675.6219
the hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .	1401.6892
( hymen , in fact , is the greek word for membrane .	314.51727
often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse .	1070.2852
as might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity .	697.9931
it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one	555.4934
so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations .	1356.7155
but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs .	576.00745
some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood .	590.8582
more rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration .	425.07947
extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated .	413.3662
these cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds .	1047.1635
in recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .	1187.0007
obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation .	478.59375
is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? ?	477.90897
gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .	801.1892
if he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it .	481.55917
as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .	2032.1815
this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act .	274.84836
the vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation .	3392.5796
this is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby .	406.757
the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .	2559.4607
but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .	231.58649
that is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain .	1399.7449
the advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .	553.6819
since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .	609.8859
by using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape .	506.6483
in this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .	1517.1239
she learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object .	1041.9684
apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment .	1686.859
it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation .	736.4743
when no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves .	479.72156
special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .	298.29117
folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints .	2450.851
the importance of loving tenderness is obvious .	2140.9316
the long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels .	1534.3318
under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .	4951.998
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .	782.68866
but during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain	511.8699
and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .	520.6824
these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .	1388.6168
the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind .	1141.023
they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina	617.4606
at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .	1427.822
in fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon .	703.1157
locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration .	343.8986
the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all .	1727.2587
such talk is seriously in error .	285.61737
ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .	441.0499
the insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen .	2055.2012
the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .	1591.1768
serious attention must also be given to the husband ' s problems in the honeymoon situation .	103.08549
the necessity for keeping alert to his bride ' s hazards can act as an interference with the man ' s spontaneous desire .	332.40784
the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .	357.67282
this is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife .	3355.0254
or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .	645.16693
the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them .	280.83713
the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again .	788.37805
this may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .	565.6168
he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .	144.30011
now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .	1619.5283
the accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman .	462.01782
too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment .	374.0193
only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .	1233.8871
both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid .	311.7532
if the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older .	540.4532
writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled the nude a study in ideal form , kenneth clark declares `` the human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations .	1199.4384
it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves ' ' .	252.03699
perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form .	749.5918
the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality .	1152.964
differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds .	406.483
whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations .	1930.0956
such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked ' ' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period ' ' .	660.28467
attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .	1324.7395
the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger ' ' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons .	796.8105
the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man ' s spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration ' ' .	323.64487
one is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .	861.5407
i still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism ' ' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit .	938.7316
in tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .	394.11853
the partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy .	752.31757
at its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares .	3032.3284
but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .	1132.0317
instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .	603.91144
in the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .	216.09119
but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .	818.15344
in a growing number of american homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .	759.691
it is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act .	139.68245
it is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband .	1044.7455
the whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs .	1097.3446
beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .	196.21997
but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .	448.76126
of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned ' ' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .	634.06793
yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .	1975.5358
the meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother ' s or grandmother ' s standards .	318.0143
to many experts , this trend was inevitable .	338.1365
they consider it simply a sign of our times .	194.8438
our society has `` emancipated ' ' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .	381.94232
it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .	524.73145
`` the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum ' ' , declares dr . mary steichen calderone , medical director of the planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent book , release from sexual tensions .	801.1735
`` it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .	198.69214
a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too ' ' .	442.01862
yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .	1098.0198
it can , in fact , wreck a marriage .	504.43655
when a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife ' s desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .	638.19196
and she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .	2718.0825
on the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .	4829.3936
he is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well .	543.735
`` a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband ' s maleness ' ' , declares dr . calderone .	448.30957
this opinion is supported by one of the nation ' s leading psychiatrists , dr . maurice e . linden , director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health .	194.81119
`` when the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous ' ' .	288.99475
in one extreme case , cited by a pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker ' s wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .	778.0255
to win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .	1002.17633
caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .	375.40012
while he was in custody his wife divorced him .	19985.998
more typical is the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage counselor .	1296.1553
this woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired ' ' for marital relations .	208.1564
to please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .	545.5222
finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .	686.95154
one wife , described by a new york psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood card parties .	1210.8025
another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis .	1774.475
after every money argument , she rebuffed her husband ' s overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .	450.27325
experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .	3881.3335
the wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .	728.5004
she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .	345.3325
the husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is `` don ' t rock the boat ' ' .	837.2367
sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .	2734.139
hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .	254.05066
more often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .	306.2918
some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .	2568.3696
the wife ' s attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .	663.98846
naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .	3304.293
unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .	536.29846
generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife ' s mercy .	287.32776
`` the pattern ' ' , says dr . morton schillinger , psychologist at new york ' s lincoln institute for psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night ' ' .	572.82983
no one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .	303.63303
after all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as dr . schillinger points out .	823.8039
there is no evidence that these milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .	2570.776
furthermore , dr . calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around .	588.5982
they aren ' t `` frigid ' ' and they aren ' t homosexual	483.15012
they ' re just restrained in all of life .	188.71873
one such man once confided to dr . theodor reik , new york psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .	1237.7333
asked why , he replied primly `` because that ' s no activity for a gentleman ' ' .	245.44975
but such cases were , in the past , unusual .	184.7058
society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the bible appears to endorse the concept .	1142.1165
family survival on our own western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man ' s strength and ability to bring home the bacon	488.49185
and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .	808.3414
this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring life with father manner .	1153.1614
in those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere .	735.6401
`` grandma wasn ' t expected to like it ' ' , dr . marion hilliard , the late toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the ' 90s .	393.98718
wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used ' ' by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were .	574.64453
when was the turning point ? ?	74.06535
when did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?	635.38965
some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .	2323.7974
virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .	721.2079
left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .	438.70847
circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance .	7671.772
she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .	519.4628
she liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .	163.45023
`` very few wives ' ' , says dr . calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .	503.6393
a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well ' ' .	269.24933
and an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .	839.6159
marriage manuals and women ' s magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .	343.85794
they began to describe in detail the woman ' s capacity for response .	216.81355
in fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , dr . albert ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior ' ' to men .	615.2584
according to dr . ellis , the average 20-year-old american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .	1748.7994
not surprisingly , dr . ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .	774.86145
yet , paradoxically , according to dr . maurice linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .	724.58765
an aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .	581.9034
`` when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife ' s aggressiveness ' ' , dr . linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .	154.97133
often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction ' ' .	182.81978
one such wife , dr . linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .	777.81036
but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .	1707.0011
then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .	73.64979
in some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .	622.3684
thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .	597.8998
if his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .	216.44778
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .	1123.9432
on the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .	1215.7698
or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .	2942.907
in any case , dr . calderone remarks , such problems are a couple ' s own affair , and can ' t always be measured by a general yardstick .	231.97751
`` as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates ' ' , dr . calderone declares .	295.27786
`` the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment ' ' .	120.63873
other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .	302.22092
and just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .	348.1701
`` to get a marriage back where it belongs ' ' , comments dr . schillinger of the lincoln institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .	387.87045
he must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .	720.73553
he must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' ' ' .	391.63705
too many husbands , dr . schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they ' re doing ' ' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play .	460.74265
she gave herself a title , lady diana harrington .	7401.565
the new york d . a . gave her another , the golden girl of cafe society .	181.69695
houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute .	758.0571
and houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on september 20 , 1960 , `` diane harris graham , 30 , d . o . a . , circumstances -- unusual ' ' .	269.8142
early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor .	281.05176
she was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world ' s oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour .	568.63586
she never hid the fact that she liked to play .	92.80986
her neighbors in the expensive houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the golden girl of the mickey jelke trial ' ' .	934.34314
it was the trial of oleomargarine heir minot ( mickey ) jelke for compulsory prostitution in new york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl .	2662.394
( jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls .	2022.0698
diane was needed as a material witness in the case and new york police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course .	674.5921
she had been moving in cafe society as lady diana harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns .	921.54156
it was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best .	680.57446
clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to assistant district attorney anthony liebler describe her to the arraigning judge	4912.29
`` this girl is the golden girl of cafe society .	577.5881
`` in 1951 she was a prostitute in new york county .	293.44138
in the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to france , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all europe with him .	1125.4073
`` at deauville she met an egyptian by the name of pulley bey .	1681.4127
he was the official procurer for king farouk , now in exile .	1212.3063
she was in egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty .	525.9263
she lied in order to get it .	33.581142
`` we have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally back into this country .	344.07657
she has been acting as a prostitute .	221.85252
`` our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to jelke ' ' .	240.46544
diane sobbingly denied this to the court .	59.508213
i never gave that boy a cent .	1856.4299
i am not a prostitute , and i had only one very wealthy boy friend ' ' , she said .	141.34212
during the course of the trial , jelke backed up part of that statement .	605.11664
`` diane is the type of girl ' ' , jelke said , `` who wouldn ' t get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor ' ' .	254.35553
but she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends ' ' .	134.94247
she came to new york from detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor ' ' instead of a chaperone .	561.7672
as she told it , `` he ' s a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 ' ' .	193.53651
she was mary lou brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive .	2642.2434
she had talked her `` boy friend ' ' into sending her to new york to take a screen test .	403.5275
the screen test was never made -- but diane was .	400.2095
she quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business .	1135.8042
she seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke .	261.32367
an ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` mr . warfield , the famous producer ' ' .	205.91533
the phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows .	127.15805
`` i ' d love to audition for you ' ' , she gushed .	382.1394
the audition was held a few minutes later in somebody ' s apartment .	340.09293
she thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance .	562.0826
after a few minutes he said , `` i can ' t use you if you dance like that .	331.35733
i ' d like to see you dance nude ' ' .	213.5274
diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again .	218.51541
even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique .	783.50305
when the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` if you go home now , i ' ll scream ' ' .	256.36295
more often than not he would bow to the inevitable .	491.266
one who needed no such threats was a french financier .	1942.4055
one of the blonde ' s yearnings that he satisfied was for travel .	923.16095
she wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a french holiday .	251.38812
in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her .	1595.868
`` then she went to deauville where she met a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers ' ' .	433.12085
the greek evidently fell for her , `` monsieur x ' ' recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100 , 000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables .	596.61786
she could do no wrong at the tables that time .	199.99782
and in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way .	3032.9907
smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to paris .	797.9786
no one ever learned what happened to the greek .	343.3371
the luxury of paris ' most fashionable hotel , the george 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to rome .	2098.195
she teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made nero envious .	1202.795
to climax her roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky hotel excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help .	3081.8464
it was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night .	311.88892
discreet italian police described it in a manner typically continental .	796.49146
`` there had been a threesome at the party in the suite ' s bedroom miss harrington ( this was diane ' s choice for a roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known american actors .	508.38733
`` the actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent .	692.243
the hotel staff , as well as residents of the excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall .	848.1704
`` they were wearing nothing but their scratches .	724.7439
they were asked to leave the hotel .	131.27083
the girls , after dressing , were indignant .	1797.8658
`` you can ' t do this to us ' ' , diane screamed .	133.27773
in the morning she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally luxurious hotel ambassador .	2312.2546
with the ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad .	1662.8978
of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do .	245.5468
by this time diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world .	750.77765
she thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in rome , she met pulley bey , a personal procurer to king farouk of egypt .	519.98517
a close friend of hers in the roman days described it this way	885.2665
`` it was a strange relationship .	705.2214
diane spoke no italian or french .	452.0688
she had a hard time making him understand that it was farouk she wished to meet .	380.38507
`` pulley bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him ' ' , the friend continued .	305.82248
it seemed as though she were always auditioning .	1755.7697
no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see farouk .	2285.8293
pulley had set her up at the semiramis hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key .	1351.8348
she picked her own middle-eastern friends from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzzed around her .	8111.9365
tewfik badrawi , mohammed gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of cairo society enjoyed her company .	1156.779
`` so extensive became her circle of admirers ' ' , egyptian police said , `` that her escapades caused distrust ' ' .	525.7124
the roof was about ready to fall in on diane ' s little world , but it took nothing less than the egyptian revolution to bring it down .	312.0109
when farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , pulley bey .	1299.6024
they also called upon diane with a request for a look at her passport .	362.1596
the cagey pulley bey , who spoke no english , had taken the passport so that diane couldn ' t leave the country without his approval .	345.84006
officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the united states .	207.6722
and return to the united states she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the new york district attorney ' s office .	386.84738
held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the women ' s house of detention , a terribly overcrowded prison .	1066.9058
it is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the district attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at vesuvio ' s , an excellent italian restaurant .	442.5579
newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the district attorney .	806.0385
with the end of the trial diane disappeared from new york .	829.6497
it was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` lady harrington ' ' .	502.26202
several years ago she married a houston business man , robert graham .	1174.0795
she later divorced graham , who is believed to have moved to bolivia .	380.61786
houston police got to know diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring .	1082.0919
last may , they said , she admitted being a prostitute .	356.56186
the next time the police saw her she was dead .	537.0547
it was september 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles .	1763.1165
she had had a party with a regular visitor , dr . william w . mcclellan .	195.20909
mcclellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died .	947.40247
he had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time .	481.18732
when he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police .	229.35266
when the police arrived , they found mcclellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently .	731.7574
the blonde ' s nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her .	895.1381
pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls .	505.6479
an autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in diane ' s body .	446.42276
police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her .	2262.7188
`` i think that maybe she wanted it this way ' ' , a vice squad cop said .	498.7908
`` a maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date .	1453.6538

franklin d . lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs . claire shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in bakersfield , california , several months ago as a prospective patient .	1097.6418
`` doctor ' ' lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes .	1089.3081
then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .	775.22614
she had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder .	1026.6323
( he explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it .	685.41925
) he knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator ' ' machine .	645.2703
as he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of mrs . shaefer ' s body , lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo .	2471.5532
yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her .	748.57666
did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people ' s health ? ?	142.27628
the human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light .	361.33423
for that reason , he informed her , the lord made the sky blue .	315.6033
continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her	1340.94
this machine will cure your cancer-ridden body ' ' .	527.17365
`` you didn ' t tell me i had cancer ' ' .	124.46768
`` you have it , all right .	274.24026
but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about .	940.9917
why , i once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body ' ' .	506.7012
he urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300 .	490.72867
when she said that she didn ' t have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one .	131.45424
he then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again ' ' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away .	782.24725
lee renewed his pressure on mrs . shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .	328.13812
after another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts ' ' .	288.61658
he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine .	571.30365
when she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , mrs . shaefer felt intense pain .	326.34756
leaving lee ' s office , mrs . shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue .	794.28174
for several days , she was ill as a result of lee ' s treatment .	168.36832
mrs . shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some $30 , 000 for his ozone machines .	1030.708
for mrs . shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee -- and her friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection bureau .	640.91895
and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of lee ' s quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend ' s clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting franklin d . lee .	961.488
the charge violation of the california medical practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs .	2154.9294
the sentence 360 days ' confinement in the county jail .	301.87784
an isolated case of quackery ? ?	2770.722
rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases .	2121.399
the machine quack makes his rube goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts .	3444.9863
with these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people ' s respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age .	1310.5026
he milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer .	4722.4185
the gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10 , 000 -- anything the traffic will bear .	850.9583
he may call himself a anaprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor ' ' -- or what have you .	904.2471
not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .	2027.3044
the medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines .	1345.9867
his plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions .	880.301
according to the food and drug administration ( fda ) , `` doctor ' ' ghadiali , dr . albert abrams and his clique , and dr . wilhelm reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10 , 000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines .	1036.7709
authorities believe that many of the doctor frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .	1284.058
look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in cleveland .	1799.879
sarah gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and mr . a . , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast ' ' and the `` diagnometer ' ' .	702.73566
multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .	892.3352
you will come up with a frightening total .	299.92838
that ' s why the fda , the american medical association ( ama ) , and the national better business bureau ( bbb ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually .	801.2618
the postmaster general recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history .	2385.6785
similarly , the american cancer society ( acs ) , the arthritis and rheumatism foundation , and the bbb have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high .	1584.4504
for example , the bbb has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago .	1489.9758
authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer .	1167.6783
in this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .	2418.0315
the economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .	414.25397
but it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .	930.10596
by preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity .	1302.8356
typically , sarah gross and mr . a both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks .	404.39468
sarah gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .	1245.8301
as a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor ' ' was using were phony .	729.34644
she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .	352.8566
mr . a . , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis -- and himself .	1072.1306
mr . a has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man .	461.8852
`` that ' s a lot of hard-earned money to lose ' ' , he says today .	254.29343
`` neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor ' s treatments ' ' .	287.26926
and there was the case of tom hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine .	1424.9606
after his pains got worse , tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .	374.8109
yes , tom caught it in time to stay alive .	198.07698
but he ' s a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor .	1578.2401
but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .	767.49445
in such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor fraud ' s cure-all gadget can prove fatal .	1187.2345
moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .	1751.0107
in chicago , some time ago , mr . h . , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike ' ' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $306 as a cure-all .	698.9206
`` hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have ' ' , said the company .	368.35464
mr . h . is dead today because he followed this advice .	464.8364
doris hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see otis g . carroll , a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in spokane .	1828.837
carroll diagnosed mrs . hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic ' ' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) .	1196.7686
his prescription hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .	1212.0259
although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water .	1138.0078
inevitably , mrs . hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds .	3044.8179
moreover , her husband and child contracted t . b . from her .	286.09787
( small wonder a spokane jury awarded the husband $35 , 823 for his wife ' s death .	1277.7766
in california , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of h . f . bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer .	635.6109
he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $185 each .	2013.8245
when authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify he was dead of cancer .	454.56302
by no means are these isolated cases .	3004.6445
`` unfortunately ' ' , says chief postal inspector david h . stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court ' ' .	862.2295
that ' s where device quackery can lead .	7510.2964
the evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands .	2265.543
who are the victims of the device quacks ? ?	184.95125
authorities say that oldsters are a prime target .	471.30328
says wallace f . jannsen , director of the fda ' s division of public information `` quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer .	758.9675
people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks ' ' .	427.40054
the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like mr . a . , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to doctor fraud ' s avarice .	836.63367
they are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .	917.115
ten-year-old richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year .	762.56757
his grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school .	832.3045
mr . and mrs . stewart were puzzled and concerned .	605.07074
then one day dick ' s classmate jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag .	398.96152
the youngsters in the boys ' class had nicknamed dick `` bugs bunny ' ' because his teeth protruded .	5247.6196
when richard ' s parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested .	995.675
during the year that followed , dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance .	1819.0752
richard stewart is no special case .	310.78903
`` the majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment ' ' , says dr . allan g . brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field .	252.0003
what do parents need to know about those `` years of the braces ' ' in order not to waste a child ' s time and their money ? ?	229.28343
how can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ?	1026.8702
why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? ?	1469.1343
what is it likely to cost ? ?	58.96968
occlusion is the dentist ' s expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed .	474.78354
malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for .	335.47452
one main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth .	3036.426
a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion .	810.9833
these two basic malformations have , of course , many variations .	118.21532
a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions	241.28494
a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw .	511.31445
crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth .	1691.6493
front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close .	513.6849
upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close .	1285.9808
the eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs .	1375.2908
second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row .	585.28754
contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition .	1827.436
however , this does not mean that a child ' s teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family .	403.14612
tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it ' s important to remember that there ' s a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits .	1023.0561
it ' s perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old .	1219.2914
occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster ' s teeth	364.4905
but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect .	600.761
malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .	1555.5332
if a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble .	891.68225
if baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place .	647.5009
every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth .	1245.7178
some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed .	252.67427
in certain cases , as in dick stewart ' s , a child ' s personality is affected .	404.05756
yet from the dentist ' s point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons .	321.1365
bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots .	748.3853
this serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults .	2142.447
then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay .	5012.163
`` for these and other reasons ' ' , says dr . brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth ' ' .	303.62363
the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system .	1158.8948
because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition .	1006.1343
badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping .	2542.373
`` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 ' ' , says dr . brodie .	262.83426
in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy .	1980.3912
orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw	1486.7815
they are not anchored directly to the bone .	228.20872
abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided .	419.0747
what can 10-year-old susan expect when she enters the orthodontist ' s office ? ?	260.2125
on her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and `` tooth prints ' ' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws .	580.0055
if he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs .	1720.3983
this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone .	894.119
as the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved .	334.11023
this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster .	577.4132
`` if teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place ' ' , explains dr . brodie .	393.77176
`` moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child ' s face ' ' .	269.72363
during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear .	1123.7578
parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay .	1966.77
when in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered .	858.721
next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending on the severity of her condition .	508.12387
during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth .	506.7814
susie ' s teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position .	404.40607
but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place .	929.2411
usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth .	1086.6566
susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day .	248.27188
then comes the time when the last wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist .	751.92664
how long will this take ? ?	169.32553
straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months .	705.5093
aligning all the teeth may take a year or more .	154.66171
an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct .	522.8624
the charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country .	1075.3629
work that might cost $500 to $750 in the south could cost $750 to $1 , 200 in new york city or chicago .	719.5199
an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1 , 000 .	317.4032
`` factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner ' ' , says dr . brodie .	153.38614
to become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist .	391.5754
`` costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher ' ' , says dr . brodie .	122.623215
`` fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago ' ' .	102.08282
people today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field .	136.4542
most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years .	256.35242
in many cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee .	692.9742
some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents .	1106.1399
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .	7506.423
dr . brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children ' s births .	926.9593
`` in the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at	4269.7524
now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent ' ' , he says .	360.18326
`` fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do ' ' .	190.32933
this knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment .	797.8367
for example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another .	1339.0972
in the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy ' s large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them .	479.93387
now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately .	2987.256
in other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment .	639.6946
the child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth .	562.28094
`` nature often takes care of the problem ' ' , says dr . brodie .	110.20571
`` a child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity ' ' .	684.41956
that is why dr . brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist ' s advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early .	1159.6194
`` both because of our culture ' s stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so .	343.5852
let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment ' ' , he urges .	235.89224
superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research .	645.22784
plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money .	853.71387
plaster of paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child .	1258.0433
as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be .	243.41983
`` after your child ' s baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it ' s time for that first dental appointment ' ' , dr . brodie advises .	270.34943
`` then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year ' ' .	827.3516
to help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things	1895.5983
he can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth .	408.1436
if a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed .	1423.62
in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them .	1595.1377
from time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him ' ' , who were `` on the other side ' ' , and reports what they are saying .	173.74214
after a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames .	1154.1345
as the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements .	413.13196
there are a few prognoses of coming events .	3455.875
another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading .	438.43115
some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual .	866.3189
not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums ' ' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased .	197.04083
in fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( esp ) , on this side of the `` veil ' ' .	720.5362
however that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons .	700.5663
perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans .	586.9001
they may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship .	714.27734
the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control ' ' who speaks through an entranced sensitive .	715.53253
what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation .	444.97693
but it is not really only a conversation .	483.15198
many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind .	623.55695
he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood	386.60306
it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! !	1554.6322
most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious ' ' moods and to clarify them .	717.4099
however , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading .	288.361
instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing .	265.0626
for this was to be a `` proxy sitting ' ' .	99.89311
as was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive .	388.2598
dr . karlis osis , director of research at the parapsychology foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` new research on survival after death ' ' , spring 1958 ) .	387.59073
he remarked `` it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter ' ' .	241.64223
the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium ' s esp may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated .	233.11877
one way to do this is by `` proxy sittings ' ' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .	597.5044
if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions .	984.05536
all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions .	1278.7117
sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings ' ' are used .	425.16135
here the absent sitter makes a `` date ' ' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to `` come in ' ' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him .	223.14072
in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else .	359.36407
he gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator .	281.99075
as always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter .	798.4231
so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium ' s esp and the absent sitter ' s mind .	341.11774
it is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield esp can range .	820.4564
now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .	633.19293
here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic ' ' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual ' s own case .	325.65735
if you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! !	185.95796
an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit ' ' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ?	366.10977
it is , of course , easy to see how `` j ' ' will mean uncle jack to one person and little jane to another .	309.16373
`` a journey ' ' , `` a little white house ' ' , `` a change of outlook ' ' , can apply to many people .	66.49672
and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one ' s own point of view , which is by nature so personal .	204.56741
one sitter may think `` a leather couch ' ' identifies a reading as surely directed to him	693.3345
to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` atta boy ' ' ! !	375.41278
to get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him .	1147.2823
if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame `` does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ?	763.5165
or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience ' ' ? ?	270.11774
conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant	369.05438
`` he had four children , two sets of twins .	490.71088
after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry .	778.7537
part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road .	123.50249
he died of typhoid in 1921 ' ' .	124.810905
methods have been developed of assigning `` weights ' ' to statements	246.91983
that is , it is known empirically that names beginning with r are more common than those beginning with z	4165.6836
that fewer women are named miranda than elizabeth	17922.322
that in the united states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox .	840.24066
so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights .	605.31464
specific dates would be important , as would double names .	407.93893
various categories have been explored to find out about these `` empirical probabilities ' ' against which to measure the readings .	419.549
in the parapsychology foundation ' s long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements .	591.1282
it is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself .	1042.0514
or , on the other hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? ?	655.04504
that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out .	207.6613
so , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator ' s name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as correct ( hit ) , incorrect ( miss ) , doubtful , or especially significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) .	553.8821
he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his .	1181.4286
all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the hits and significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter ' s own reading .	576.32007
that is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .	645.49286
conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material .	585.1653
and there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated .	257.09903
in another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements .	660.3763
does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ?	529.70703
does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? ?	629.5783
it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` hits ' ' .	315.57095
now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream ' ' , where the sensitive is at her best .	246.85321
mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses .	367.5814
`` i feel cold ' ' , the medium says , or `` my leg aches ' ' , `` my head is heavy ' ' .	132.43881
or perhaps she hears words or sounds `` there ' s such a noise of loud machinery ' ' , or `` i hear a child crying ' ' , or `` he says we ' re all here and glad to see you ' ' .	237.59048
maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door ' ' .	360.08777
the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions .	1319.4187
sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there .	663.14307
if pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer .	389.04614
if asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them ' ' -- some more vividly than others .	498.25903
perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all .	804.0075
even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another ' s personalities , moods , intentions .	595.0518
of course , there is an element of training here these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power .	420.88226
simply using it increases its intensity , i was told by one sensitive .	335.1148
nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery .	1115.6068
impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .	599.55646
it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning .	415.08643
if communication with an entity on the `` other side ' ' is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism .	317.4477
during one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons .	848.38434
but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail	1348.1996
taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement .	2327.5747
in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained .	1203.0062
though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols a slope to signify the name `` hill ' ' , for instance .	887.0297
one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter .	995.282
the farmer ' s life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock .	478.92273
a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .	538.1049
even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .	397.77237
the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily .	877.87396
he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice	867.26544
such a move may mean a loss of capital .	195.07268
hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life .	399.0734
the farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night .	230.77505
frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .	562.0124
no matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up .	868.46387
it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .	2018.3523
production may fall far below expectations .	1192.784
drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops .	1065.4863
sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner ' s earnings , even into his capital .	203.23898
returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year .	359.00714
the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis .	1005.1718
land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .	831.7475
part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .	1376.7178
if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high .	576.79486
a part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .	781.84454
it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .	1027.1083
he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn .	502.73404
there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job .	1643.6569
the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost .	588.0203
this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .	1071.3951
if the farm is rented , the rent must be paid .	367.0612
if it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of .	250.2382
a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children .	1225.602
it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air .	351.2224
the children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .	1041.4677
caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work .	521.66925
part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs .	880.1864
for some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income .	734.74194
it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health .	672.3762
generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city .	179.43484
the savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .	251.79637
usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more .	302.76773
where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same .	539.6562
a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .	2376.1838
some persons consider the work on a farm recreational .	767.77374
for some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner .	237.20335
land , labor , and equipment needed	600.5307
part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal .	337.43555
it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation .	262.48483
general requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below .	302.6641
specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .	896.9972
three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs .	634.0437
you could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .	521.5967
if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you ' ll need more land .	390.36273
in deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you ' ll need to bring in the income you expect .	221.95749
but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .	805.9574
the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .	475.3165
some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .	663.5834
this is a highly speculative venture .	3112.8293
sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .	289.02383
when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm .	637.2216
if you have a year-round , full-time job you can ' t expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help .	694.4346
as a rule , part-time farmers hire little help .	5183.1504
in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .	339.6788
list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month .	207.11197
you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one .	604.0307
do not include all your spare time or all your family ' s spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work .	353.62802
if you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools .	325.95236
you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however .	235.14833
for larger plantings , you ' ll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .	1098.9736
if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) .	1095.977
these tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing .	827.68353
cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer .	866.3049
if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises .	1340.6733
you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .	1070.985
if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work .	471.38577
before you look for a farm you ' ll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake	196.52682
and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent .	329.6913
information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture .	578.5128
if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy .	324.21317
discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .	753.36255
choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .	1506.909
then if you change jobs you won ' t necessarily have to sell the farm .	325.4917
the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .	595.11224
obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .	431.24878
if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby .	687.3002
if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city .	274.73752
look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .	426.0927
there are slums in the country as well as in the city .	83.09177
few rural areas are protected by zoning .	1978.6515
a tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .	1013.4159
check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them .	96.66482
find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality .	789.02826
if these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect .	341.76965
you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .	1168.3428
you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water .	756.3638
if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled .	308.43396
a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden .	899.1842
pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble .	361.32462
the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses .	862.4227
is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ?	208.9678
if you can ' t tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist .	690.83496
soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones .	1631.0166
small areas that aren ' t right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop .	308.56253
will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? ?	815.4776
how much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? ?	779.89307
if the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements .	944.27606
the value of the farm to you will depend on --	495.19034
its worth as a place to live .	129.81326
the value of the products you can raise on it .	242.83623
the possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision .	1523.1931
decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town .	291.68445
take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work .	350.7901
next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm .	211.70505
to do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm .	466.90656
list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year .	213.35764
estimate the value of the produce at normal prices .	433.82526
the total is the probably gross income from farming .	2364.5579
to find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming .	4091.9434
include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment .	535.04816
also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family .	249.00208
it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it .	479.98676
otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor .	412.75565
to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .	336.21472
everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge .	904.07855
for almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .	1609.7328
one who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers .	721.65955
the gruesome humor of the nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david -- nor the gratuitous sadism of ss officers .	690.7925
public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the german press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .	541.5756
and still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .	419.46658
most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant ' s department of jewish affairs .	736.82104
counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .	934.5855
would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client ' s chances ? ?	1692.8055
those who feared `` emotionalism ' ' at the trial showed less understanding than dr . servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .	636.3984
interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the attorney general for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow .	968.013
but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new york .	372.5448
in each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course in moscow the liquidation of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalin ' s dictatorship	352.7153
in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism , with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard .	5047.7515
these trials were properly termed `` political cases ' ' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .	364.97137
but what could the eichmann trial initiate ? ?	3920.5295
of what new course could it mark the beginning ? ?	1174.2788
the eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future .	69.069954
it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are jews .	366.287
as such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message ' ' .	247.62433
`` it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial ' ' -- said ben gurion , `` and not the nazi regime alone -- but anti-semitism throughout history ' ' .	428.53394
how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism ? ?	615.20886
and if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove eichmann a `` fiend ' ' ? ?	252.46675
these questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution ' s case .	140.04524
it might be contended , of course , that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism .	1243.4917
but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment .	517.025
in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument .	309.01132
one who could be linked to anti-semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the ages .	992.8754
shout at eichmann though he might , the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism .	480.00735
yes , he believed that the jews were `` enemies of the reich ' ' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic ' ' anti-semites	167.7155
but he believed in the jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .	388.40073
the real question was how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself .	276.2511
in regard to eichmann , it was to be found in the nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent .	569.79376
perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could , as eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer .	1103.7916
not through fear of disobeying orders , as eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitler ' s victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` well , let ' s try it ' ' .	601.8672
at any rate , the substance of eichmann ' s testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the ss , and though the prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to that extent .	541.9231
but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it .	778.07
if anti-semitism was on trial in jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of eichmann ' s department of jewish affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of jews by non-police and non-party anti-semites in germany , as well as in poland , czechoslovakia , hungary ? ?	415.15115
the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the german state , including the reich minister of the interior , the state secretary in charge of the four year plan , the reich minister of justice , the under secretary of foreign affairs .	427.90973
the measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .	883.8556
heydrich , in opening the conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by goering which authorized the final solution as `` a complement to ' ' previous `` solutions ' ' for eliminating the jews from german living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .	1127.6731
in other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating in every phase of german life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .	670.03503
this , in fact , it turned out to be .	52.431194
since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling german industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of hitler ' s crimes	808.634
whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .	320.10242
what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?	1032.0643
not in eichmann ' s anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning of the trial .	278.96088
no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had conceived their anti-semitism as an `` innocent ' ' dislike of jews , as do others like them today .	433.0244
the final solution proved that the jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .	1110.0574
ought not an edifying trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere ' ' anti-semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ?	917.18274
the prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-semitism ' ' among the germans which hitler `` stimulated and transformed ' ' .	626.7839
but if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmann ' s head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .	382.62756
nor did the trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .	696.2702
certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .	801.45514
eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .	429.52493
do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the jews in germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ?	1388.0026
the career of eichmann made the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization fearful of being mistaken for a jew , he seeks protection in his nazi uniform	3293.2727
clinging to the enemy-jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness	1272.9905
once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .	2319.8694
`` is this the type of citizen you desire ' ' ? ?	532.93805
the trial should have asked the nations .	149.72939
but though this characterization in no way diminished eichmann ' s guilt , the prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it .	304.3873
finally , if the mission of the trial was to convict anti-semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the final solution was aided by native jew-haters -- i . e . , germany , poland , hungary , czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- denmark , holland , italy , bulgaria , france ? ?	578.8763
should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports ? ?	1203.5192
wasn ' t this meaning of eichmann ' s experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ?	434.5097
as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage , the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .	394.45563
only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin .	820.92175
it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe .	180.67023
it is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable	588.94574
most of the information elicited in jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .	777.75134
in poughkeepsie , n . y . , , in 1952 , a roman catholic hospital presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff .	656.4897
three agreed , but four declined and were suspended .	1077.9401
after a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 .	454.41718
the peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy .	360.86728
in new york city in 1958 , the city ' s commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a contraceptive device .	471.50583
he thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving protestants , jews and roman catholics that continued for two months , until the city ' s board of hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .	1180.9999
a year later in albany , n . y . , a roman catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood association .	670.29224
immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man ' s right to freedom of religious belief and conscience .	357.4159
these incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .	727.7543
it has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies .	4935.9297
it has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .	482.1389
where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .	3682.9966
the time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .	564.4847
the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .	634.9217
instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .	522.1381
`` all too frequently ' ' , points out james o ' gara , managing editor of commonweal , `` catholics run roughshod over protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades ' ' .	631.7555
all too often our language is unduly harsh .	3141.45
the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between catholics and non-catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning .	1704.0725
instead of catholics ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .	2030.1079
family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring .	260.49643
pope pius 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications ' ' .	314.08325
this means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .	290.30423
these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics in family planning .	1511.7649
the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons .	1678.8883
the roman catholic church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning .	355.38776
catholics , protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used .	353.8009
the roman catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period .	927.71014
the church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author it involves no frustration of nature ' s laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .	463.59723
with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice .	941.9452
there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .	429.7433
the grounds for the church ' s position are scriptural ( old testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .	319.2465
the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .	1204.6388
the roman catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end .	732.95447
this conclusion is based on two propositions that man by the use of his reason can ascertain god ' s purpose in the universe and that god makes known his purpose by certain `` given ' ' physical arrangements .	347.64636
thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .	457.08237
moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by god , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception .	713.86163
believing that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature , roman catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .	449.02692
let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable .	543.6613
but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .	1041.8655
why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ?	332.19202
it is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others .	985.1967
it is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others .	1278.197
both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .	559.2818
consider what happened during world war 1 , , when the protestant churches united to push the prohibition law through congress .	359.1715
many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .	457.2138
with over four million american men away at war , protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public .	1205.3276
with the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .	349.23395
the attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history .	1939.7722
the so-called `` noble experiment ' ' came to an inglorious end .	377.03598
that tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .	510.93835
that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today .	466.92703
up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law .	798.63556
this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian countries .	377.08652
today , the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction .	2085.1733
the various lambeth conferences , expressing the anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally .	1454.4491
in 1920 , the lambeth conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race ' ' .	820.8521
denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the conference declared `` we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage .	620.6904
one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children	337.98868
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control ' ' .	804.6296
the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .	557.7284
in 1930 , the lambeth conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .	1118.4858
in 1958 , the conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by god on parents everywhere .	1689.0161
many other protestant denominations preceded the anglicans in such action .	1090.1511
in march , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified artificial methods of birth control .	794.7011
`` as to the necessity ' ' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .	153.16124
there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right ' ' .	608.91425
since then , many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .	766.09625
what determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive in general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .	394.83463
this development is reflected in the action taken in february , 1961 , by the general board of the national council of churches , the largest protestant organization in the aj .	140.94832
the board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning .	757.9411
it called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives .	1505.0735
the general board declared `` most of the protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .	1162.116
the general protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception ' ' .	310.4087
an action once universally condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .	531.3164
this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .	217.44359
repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control .	675.9032
for all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american people is clear , profound and far-reaching .	449.76086
to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment .	485.97223
this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .	441.23248
conscience and religion are concerned with private sin the civil law is concerned with public crimes .	1550.462
only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .	1548.899
among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself .	1158.4025
on april 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , discovery , weighed anchor in st . katherine ' s pool , london , and floated down the thames toward the sea .	772.0732
she carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic waters of north america .	495.61813
seventeen months later , on september 6 , 1611 , an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery limping eastward outside galway bay .	6150.6426
when she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation .	446.9872
the captain was gone , and the mate was gone .	141.02907
the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .	1180.9216
what disaster struck the discovery during those seventeen months ? ?	543.2325
what happened to the fourteen missing men ? ?	778.39136
these questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .	192.57132
for hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain ' s fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man ' s desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports .	201.68169
all told , they offered a highly confused picture .	2509.1184
but since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .	1440.7124
not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .	309.8701
historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .	1307.5663
first , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma .	3230.1816
second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on american towns and counties , on a great american river , and on half a million square miles of arctic seas .	528.8217
this is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine	325.93463
the sailing in the spring of 1610 was hudson ' s fourth in four years .	337.80338
each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from western europe to the far east .	399.71097
in 1607 and 1608 , the english muscovy company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole or across the top of russia .	461.98608
twice he had failed , and the muscovy company indicated it would not back him again .	364.99646
in 1609 , the dutch east india company hired hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the half moon , and supplied him with dutch sailors .	1430.9751
this time he turned westward , to the middle atlantic coast of north america .	667.54913
his chief discovery was important -- the great north ( later , the hudson ) river -- but it produced no northwest passage .	503.447
when the half moon put in at dartmouth , england , in the fall of 1609 , word of hudson ' s findings leaked out , and english interest in him revived .	345.4839
the government forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship .	465.60236
he thereupon went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .	579.56396
by springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of henry , prince of wales .	682.54266
he had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .	1078.0938
the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .	795.56335
a century of exploration had established that a great land mass , north and south america , lay between europe and the indies .	390.0202
one by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .	738.7528
in fact , hudson ' s sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes .	244.59593
but there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .	740.7062
nearly twenty-five years before , captain john davis had noted , as he sailed near the arctic circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides ' ' .	426.45026
he named this opening , between baffin island and labrador , the `` furious overfall ' ' .	671.76215
( later , it was to be called hudson strait .	387.3727
in 1602 , george waymouth , in the same little discovery that hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .	1555.7867
hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway .	1668.0662
even hudson , experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the thames .	814.7993
ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters .	5230.482
on previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain .	337.2449
on the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .	850.93317
on the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic .	1054.9287
worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .	875.03284
of only one could he be sure -- young john hudson , his second son .	1087.3689
the mate , robert juet , who had kept the journal on the half moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity .	310.32742
philip staffe , the ship ' s carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .	543.2729
arnold lodley and michael perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against hudson in a crisis .	1140.6307
but men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find .	1189.3015
hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .	578.6227
and he refused to be anything else .	275.45056
it is believed that hudson was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was trained on company ships .	969.9615
he was a londoner , married , with three sons .	515.9308
( the common misconception that he was dutch and that his first name was hendrik stem from dutch documents of his third voyage .	831.9204
) in 1610 , hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession .	2130.598
hudson ' s first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the thames .	773.8036
there at the river ' s edge waited one henry greene , whom hudson listed as a `` clerk ' ' .	550.38257
greene was in actuality a young ruffian from kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores .	1707.5344
he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had greene wait at gravesend , where the discovery picked him up .	1451.6846
for the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of great britain , then turned westward .	824.48926
on may 11 , she reached iceland .	2263.9338
poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` lousie bay ' ' .	684.6513
the subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .	2832.5095
with hudson looking on , his protege greene picked a fight with the ship ' s surgeon , edward wilson .	1113.379
the issue was settled on shore , greene winning and wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england .	1194.5155
with difficulty , hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from iceland .	668.53503
early in june , the discovery passed `` desolation ' ' ( southern greenland ) and in mid-june entered the `` furious overfall ' ' .	577.367
floating ice bore down from the north and west .	124.41856
fog hung over the route constantly .	8508.293
turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet .	299.8277
the ship ' s compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north pole .	817.83514
as the bergs grew larger , hudson was forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay , an inlet of the great strait .	942.98865
after finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled .	948.0753
the trouble was at least partly juet ' s doing .	307.77505
for weeks he had been saying that hudson ' s idea of sailing through to java was absurd .	707.7088
the great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason .	1170.0706
a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther .	1215.9467
instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( sir francis drake lopped a man ' s head off under similar circumstances ) , hudson decided to be reasonable .	989.8642
he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew .	390.62582
patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives .	199.95308
when hudson had finished , the `` town meeting ' ' broke down into a general , wordy argument .	491.77905
one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in england .	108.66613
up spoke carpenter staffe , who said he wouldn ' t give ten pounds to be home .	115.6993
hudson was free to sail on .	403.27957
all through july the discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands .	4527.5073
on august 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as hudson knew , seen by europeans .	2934.2178
to starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds .	2087.2402
to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2 , 000 feet .	1402.5603
hudson named the capes digges and wolstenholme , for two of his backers .	1634.5233
hudson pointed the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called hudson bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the pacific .	443.0851
after three weeks ' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas .	1491.5212
the great `` sea to the westwards ' ' was a dead end .	292.37302
this must have been hudson ' s blackest discovery .	1290.487
for he seemed to sense at once that before him was no south sea , but the solid bulk of the north american continent .	544.0283
this was the bitter end , and hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure .	354.40927
feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .	772.43884
north and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week .	1144.988
hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to england through the `` furious overfall ' ' was again filling with ice .	392.56705
the men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .	3799.016
once more , juet ' s complaints were the loudest .	668.92633
hudson ' s reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .	548.92267
juet demanded that hudson prove his charges in an open trial .	607.1624
the trial was held september 10 .	663.9416
hudson , presiding , heard juet ' s defense , then called for testimony from crew members .	1214.2056
juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward .	1190.937
hands on bible , seaman lodley and carpenter staffe swore that juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins .	3356.9426
cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .	2116.856
others added that juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .	688.34644
hudson deposed juet and cut his pay .	456.23053
the new mate was robert bylot , talented but inexperienced .	10546.174
there were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves .	853.57184
the important result , however , was that juet and francis clemens , the deposed boatswain , became hudson ' s sworn enemies .	1160.5177
as hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew ' s respect for him .	923.47095
once , after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather , hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed .	1379.1147
just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .	1847.7654
michael butt and adame moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .	2801.1667
the anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but philip staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe .	661.1432
thomas douglas , fifth earl of selkirk , a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river of the north .	667.5415
since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the hudson ' s bay company , he purchased great blocks of the comany ' s stock with the view to controlling its policies .	540.18317
having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116 , 000 square miles in the valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers .	296.52615
the grant , which stretched southward to lake traverse -- the headwaters of the red -- was made in may , 1811 , and by october of that year a small group of scots was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay .	800.54004
thus at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle of tippecanoe , anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the north american continent to the west of the american agricultural frontier .	897.8338
seven hundred miles south of york factory , at `` the forks ' ' of the red and the assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in august 1812 .	575.7897
by october the little colony about fort douglas ( present-day winnipeg ) numbered 100 .	2501.009
within a few years the scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called meurons .	1204.4308
the latter , members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the war of 1812 , had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .	707.48444
selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .	633.2512
the mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 .	1171.2959
it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .	1604.986
when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the scots , swiss and metis moved up the red to the mouth of the pembina river .	615.29865
here they built huts and a stockade named fort daer after selkirk ' s barony in scotland .	1547.0803
the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .	1071.7784
the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by british fur traders .	1357.2849
for many years the northwest company had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi river , some 300 miles southeast of present-day st . paul , minnesota .	679.84827
when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm out of the united states , its british-born employees , now become american citizens -- joseph rolette , joseph renville and alexis bailly -- continued in the fur business .	903.8306
on big stone lake near the headwaters of the red river , robert dickson , superintendent of the western indian department of canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .	527.0786
his trading goods came from canada to the forks of red river and from selkirk ' s settlement he brought them south in carts .	557.0998
these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk colony was begun .	994.6719
in 1802 henry referred to `` our new carts ' ' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack .	1122.6829
they were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .	1927.4082
it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states .	334.26562
in september 1817 at fort daer ( pembina ) dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of sioux , he escorted to prairie du chien .	1064.987
during the trip selkirk decided that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern united states was the best route for goods from england to reach red river and that the united states was a better source of supply for many goods than either canada or england .	523.367
upon arriving at baltimore , selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams , secretary of state at washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` missouri and illinois territories ' ' .	674.4364
this traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our settlements .	641.70245
the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .	462.5775
in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the forks ' ' ( fort douglas ) and in december 1819 , twenty men left fort daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien .	843.08453
it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on mackinac boats .	603.4356
with these completed and ice gone from the st . peter ' s river ( present-day minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to big stone lake , across into lake traverse , and down the red .	1162.6691
they reached fort douglas in june 1820 .	730.5831
this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk ab1 , 040 .	4286.239
nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to fort daer for food .	1016.9991
thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .	686.4519
activity by british traders and the presence of a colony on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of prairie du chien , until then the most advanced united states post .	1079.4827
in september 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the st . peter ' s river , the head of navigation on the mississippi , and began construction of fort st . anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , colonel josiah snelling .	350.98215
it was from the american outposts that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good .	1890.062
hercules l . dousman , fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien , contracted to supply selkirk ' s people with some 300 head of cattle , and alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers .	1512.6849
bailly , after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the hudson ' s bay company ' s post on lake traverse `` in the sieux country ' ' and reached fort garry , as the selkirk hudson ' s bay company center was now called , late in the fall .	450.64444
he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward the united states .	1489.6797
observing their distressing condition , colonel snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation .	2926.9346
as these swiss were moving from the selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota , dousman of michilimackinac , michigan , and prairie du chien was traveling to red river to open a trade in merchandise .	890.4242
early in 1822 he was at fort garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco .	1048.4609
alexander mcdonnell , governor of red river , and james bird , a chief factor of the hudson ' s bay company , ordered such `` sundry articles ' ' to a value of ab4 , 500 .	323.7307
for its part the hudson ' s bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement .	328.4352
as the time drew near for the drawing of the british-american frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the pembina colony -- its own post and fort daer -- was on american territory .	790.0429
accordingly selkirk ' s agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by october , john halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to `` the forks ' ' in rafts .	1107.1669
`` i have done everything ' ' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment .	140.81451
' ' despite company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village .	1147.9526
they would attempt to bring supplies from st . louis or prairie du chien at `` great expense as well as danger ' ' .	387.5072
at fort garry some of the swiss also decided to cast their lot with the united states , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to fort snelling .	543.6943
the disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave .	350.37534
after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on october 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick .	640.9489
in april came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-june .	3486.0269
on june 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the mississippi .	877.61066
by fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about fort snelling , but most of them were sent on to galena and st . louis , with a few going as far as vevay , indiana , a notable swiss center in the united states .	516.0007
in 1837 , 157 red river people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at fort snelling .	903.80225
below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the mississippi river .	2040.6888
at the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by father lucian galtier in 1840 .	2860.542
its people , including pierre bottineau and other american fur company employees and the refugees from fort garry , were joined by the remaining scots and swiss from fort snelling when major joseph plympton expelled them from the reservation in may 1840 .	2200.4692
the resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father galtier ' s mission , st . paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers who remained at red river .	511.58978
while population at fort garry increased rapidly , from 2 , 417 in 1831 to 4 , 369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .	1165.6167
accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the hudson ' s bay company , some settlers went into trade .	1320.6455
the company maintained a store at which products of england could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs .	512.2669
despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the fort garry merchants were trading with the indians for furs .	909.8846
in june 1845 , the governor and council of assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via hudson ' s bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the company ' s trade and power ' ' .	368.93262
to reduce further the flow of goods from england , the company ' s local officials asked that its london authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men .	801.19415
with their customary source of supply cut off , the fort garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the mississippi country .	903.3455
others carried pemmican from `` the forks ' ' to st . paul and goods from st . paul to red river , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the british settlement .	429.3697
this trade was subject to a tariff of 7 . 5 per cent after february 1835 , but much was smuggled into assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the london committee .	391.14304
the trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel .	937.9432
the letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .	953.2694
indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of american literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray .	270.9998
some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive .	951.0697
a confederate observed that the yankees were `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier ' ' .	2194.9424
another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house ' ' .	777.0037
a third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide ' ' .	741.54517
yanks were equally adept at figurative expression .	1318.6602
one wrote `` ( i am so hungry ) i could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups ' ' .	706.3676
a second reported that the dilapidated houses in virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times ' ' .	546.8932
a third remarked of slowness of southerners `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god ' ' .	1141.6592
still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget ' ' .	1786.6918
a yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart `` my girl is none of your one-horse girls .	885.6241
she is a regular stub and twister , double geered .	11759.891
she is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and union from the muzzle to the crupper ' ' .	593.3883
humor found many modes of expression .	78.78921
a texan wrote to a male companion at home `` what has become of halda and laura ? ?	1044.1553
when you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now , but love by god ' ' .	350.2514
william r . stillwell , an admirable georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the georgia department of archives and history , liked to tease his wife in his letters .	999.57385
after he had been away from home about a year he wrote `` ( dear wife ) if i did not write and receive letters from you i believe that i would forgit that i was married .	366.82324
i don ' t feel much like a maryed man but i never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if i should you must forgive me as i am so forgitful ' ' .	966.0248
a yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote `` i am growing so fat i am a burden 2 myself ' ' .	570.73486
another yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer `` now i lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o ' er my body creep	4253.7188
if they should bite before i wake , i pray the lord their jaws to break ' ' .	298.70535
charles thiot , a splendid georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .	356.526
but he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine .	973.18964
near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` fall-in ' ' and the other `` close-up ' ' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of fall-in and close-up ' ' .	233.05199
the soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the civil war armies were an earthy people .	600.44507
they talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body .	227.64758
one of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea .	2490.3452
men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels ' '	1191.1392
but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts ' ' .	529.4469
a michigan soldier stationed in georgia wrote in 1864	908.0351
`` i expect to be tough as a knott as soon as i get over the georgia shitts ' ' .	753.42145
johnny rebs from the deep south who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the virginia quickstep ' ' .	596.3886
a georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea `` i have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days .	954.4274
i eat too much eggs and poark .	12876.848
it sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me ' ' .	643.11523
a michigan soldier wrote his brother `` i am well at present with the exception i have got the dyerear and i hope thease few lines find you the same ' ' .	583.32434
the letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .	2579.194
save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .	1101.2676
most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee .	578.61053
in the south , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .	241.4806
scarcity of paper caused many southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing , i . e . , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written .	395.1277
sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .	3015.9443
a yank writing from vicksburg , may 28 , 1863 , stated `` not less than 50 balls have passed over me since i commenced writing .	1867.9619
i could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now ' ' .	334.9884
a reb stationed near petersburg informed his mother `` i need not tell you that i dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter .	960.1218
just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for i don ' t dodge every time ' ' .	228.04599
another reb writing under similar circumstances before atlanta reported `` the yankees keep shooting so i am afraid they will knock over my ink , so i will close ' ' .	543.87317
the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives .	885.4193
but fathers often addressed communications to their small children	712.8164
and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of civil war letters .	512.6958
rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the negro community .	583.2799
occasionally they would write to the slaves .	79.307526
early in the war it was not uncommon for planters ' sons to retain in camp negro `` body servants ' ' to perform the menial chores such as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes .	1326.4828
sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners ' families .	1055.1937
unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .	1973.169
owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century america , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling .	2328.1096
occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in richmond , petersburg , washington , or nashville .	2390.4395
but these comments are hardly printable .	15255.19
an alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the virginia belles `` they thout i was a saint .	1793.3555
i told them some sweet lies and they believed it all .	736.01025
i would tell them i got a letter from home stating that five of my negroes had runaway and ten of pappy ' s .	816.485
but i wold say i recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk ' ' .	857.7347
some of the letters were pungently expressive .	8327.582
an ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus `` dear sis .	1360.039
alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse .	3405.546
i think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as alf dyer and let that orney thefin , drunkard , damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you , the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion , he is too orney for hel .	9871.77
i will shute him as shore as i sea him ' ' .	344.3055
initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions .	5139.628
a federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in virginia `` dear pa .	1048.297
we got to one house where there were five secessionists .	967.2615
they brok & run and arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them .	3937.8076
thay may say what they please but godamit pa it is fun ' ' .	594.93695
some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers .	1486.3356
a mississippi soldier wrote `` our general reub davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass ' ' .	1926.6519
an alabamian wrote `` col . henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn ' ' .	835.83856
a floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear ' ' .	624.9974
on december 9 , 1862 , sergeant edwin h . fay , an unusual louisianan who held a . b . and m . a . degrees from harvard university and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in louisiana , wrote his wife `` i saw pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke i ever saw .	723.02734
his head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps .	356.09933
jackson runs first and his cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader .	811.08655
but he is a west point graduate and therefore must be born to command ' ' .	352.8581
similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of northern soldiers .	132.10744
a massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a civil war version of bill mauldin , wrote `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks .	363.35526
they get all the glory and most of the pay and don ' t earn ten cents apiece on the average , the drunken rascals ' ' .	413.8737
private george gray hunter of pennsylvania wrote `` i am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago ' ' .	354.00104
another yankee became so disgusted as to state `` i wish to god one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ) ' ' .	417.2998
no group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors .	777.9331
one federal soldier wrote `` the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do ( c ) ters and offersey when this war is over ' ' .	2414.888
shortly after the beginning of sherman ' s georgia campaign , an ailing yank wrote his homefolk `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment .	731.83026
i insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that i had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) union quackery ' ' .	618.1238
the attitudes which the rebs and yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred .	1046.035
the rebs were , to a massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame ' ' .	974.0406
a pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever i saw .	266.97928
they looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings .	688.0304
' ' private jenkins lloyd jones of the wisconsin light artillery wrote in his diary `` i strolled among the alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity i think in the universe , their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect .	1019.2848
they recooned as how you ' uns all would be a heap wus to we ' uns all ' ' ' .	933.8817
in a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , thomas taylor , a private in the 6th alabama volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated `` you know that my heart is with you but i never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe , by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is booty .	752.28345
the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america .	219.68962
and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world .	192.31052
thus , if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset .	278.47406
historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .	896.5858
1 ) every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .	779.9247
what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred .	461.10046
2 ) as a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness .	3381.7456
its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .	406.61194
one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years .	413.43268
the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american war , the steady currency of the lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point .	590.2621
nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of american life , that learned societies such as the american folklore society and the american historical association were founded in the 1880s , or that courses in american literature , american civilization , american anything have swept our school and college curricula .	615.53894
of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century united states .	767.4286
yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .	557.92944
it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .	1975.612
after all , the average american as he lies and waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen ' s comprehension and control .	607.91705
anyone ' s identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .	2611.708
such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes .	2138.7654
in america , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .	1838.9248
a heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land .	472.05743
but we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .	597.63434
parson weems ' s george washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting states .	701.79297
abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national constitution .	280.96118
robert e . lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .	2090.8992
and their roles are paralleled by those of patrick henry , nathan hale , andrew jackson , davy crockett , theodore roosevelt and many , many more .	2768.2048
therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts .	185.00514
1 ) most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all .	864.40137
2 ) the concept that an `` american national folklore ' ' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend .	646.6802
folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission .	3127.2754
it has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .	1315.2114
related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence .	1102.812
though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .	918.82904
in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .	1073.9122
enthusiastically , americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like paul bunyan tales , abe lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition .	4283.926
nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .	1426.4712
naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore .	552.44
that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .	918.15234
as long as his material is americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic ' ' to his audience , he remains satisfied .	364.51065
from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore .	404.41647
on the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation .	546.0435
on the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western ' ' or colonial material willy-nilly .	1443.1815
unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used american folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .	897.102
after all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates .	816.7167
in addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever-expanding and changing society .	1054.8925
the problems confuse even the experts .	116.90973
for that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed .	814.3744
anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .	1034.9374
they have widely varying backgrounds and aims .	1354.5558
they have little `` esprit de corps ' ' .	83.23616
the outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque .	455.8813
his love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he doesn ' t care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote .	374.23355
folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such .	374.42416
the amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field .	230.4245
the collector enjoys the contact with rural life	1908.3953
he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream ' ' reasons that many persons hunt game	710.6389
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .	486.63055
fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don ' t distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .	348.2975
but there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century german scholarship .	700.1201
both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .	177.32086
both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines .	771.9723
the commercial propagandist , who can ' t afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst ' s toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .	540.13837
his standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst .	211.72293
to both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .	2973.288
dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector .	565.0513
the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .	2336.3604
the work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience .	566.8467
publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material .	2009.9823
the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in .	149.79344
as a result , most people don ' t have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is	405.961
they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there .	1312.8348
and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .	868.30286
if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american public .	400.21085
and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each .	308.49176
does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz ' ' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?	395.19308
when the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? ?	1164.2291
is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was ? ?	315.48444
or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? ?	508.9721
when he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged .	370.91406
in the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale .	598.0571
robert frost , for instance , writes about rural life in new england , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems .	255.30333
this has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet ' ' , simply because he is a rural one .	343.9765
in the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than frost to being `` folk writers ' ' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material .	497.0078
stephen vincent benet ' s john brown ' s body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does john steinbeck ' s the grapes of wrath and carl sandburg ' s the people , yes .	324.47528
the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass .	1450.8492
folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .	1012.9985
the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude .	624.0168
in fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don ' t care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits .	524.06226
nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days ' ' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .	548.17725
as part of the same arrangement , torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign , bestowed upon o ' banion a third share in the hawthorne smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade .	516.89856
the coalition was to prove inadvisable .	7965.149
o ' banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others ' .	1370.104
he had a round , frank irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone ' s body .	2292.101
he carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands .	1216.6031
he killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately .	2986.9397
the police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them .	244.01834
like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol .	2958.526
he was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths .	8379.133
he had no apparent comprehension of morality	2513.662
he divided humanity into `` right guys ' ' and `` wrong guys ' ' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .	270.66827
he had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality ' ' .	185.98917
he walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns .	1068.7924
landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly ' ' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath .	1498.0251
he was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as torrio and capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the chicago underworld , the roughneck king .	766.29865
o ' banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant irish plasterer , in the north side ' s little hell , close by the sicilian quarter and death corner .	743.03705
he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral and also served as an acolyte to father o ' brien .	1093.1847
the influence of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace	3137.2585
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking .	2097.927
at the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .	400.77686
because of this he was known as gimpy ( but , as with capone and his nickname of scarface , never in his presence ) .	801.2878
in his teens o ' banion was enrolled in the vicious market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgovern ' s cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out .	1761.887
he then got a job with the chicago herald-examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper ' s news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors .	1660.5532
he was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary , later committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor .	3634.171
o ' banion ' s first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to bridewell prison for three months for burglary	455.2246
two years later he served another three months for assault .	964.3155
those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .	1233.7141
but by now o ' banion ' s political pull was beginning to be effective .	104.156746
on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10 , 000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed .	1736.3267
on one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant john j . ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the postal telegraph building	1837.5415
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30 , 000 in bribes , it was estimated .	453.70117
as promptly as torrio , o ' banion jumped into bootlegging .	288.85907
he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the sicilians , but he had his huge north side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money .	607.76056
unlike the sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .	2278.5872
he was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 o ' banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state `` i always deliver my borough as per requirements ' ' .	539.8981
until 1924 o ' banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his north side domain solidly democratic .	8868.859
there was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time q . `` who ' ll carry the forty-second and forty-third wards ' ' ? ?	1142.6951
a . o ' banion , in his pistol pocket ' ' .	74.79522
but as november 1924 drew close the democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that o ' banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important republicans .	1199.7146
to forestall any change of allegiance , the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o ' banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .	1488.6805
the reception was held in a private dining room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west .	632.7999
it was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .	13519.991
the guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of american civic life at this time .	287.52252
it included the top o ' banion men and chief of detectives michael hughes .	993.8265
when mayor dever heard of the banquet he summoned hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers .	1766.9636
hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of jerry o ' connor , the proprieter of a loop gambling house .	559.2503
`` but when i arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , i knew i had been framed , and withdrew almost at once ' ' .	844.46814
in fact , o ' connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin .	1194.0144
there was a brief interruption while one of o ' banion ' s men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip .	613.4214
then o ' banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .	1831.1703
this dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth ' ' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` belshazzar feasts ' ' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels ' ' .	717.81537
pasley continued `` they became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 ' ' .	306.15152
however , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .	3332.3723
o ' banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better republican deal .	777.20746
on election day -- november 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes .	5829.446
the result was a landslide for the republican candidates .	2102.0305
this further demonstration of o ' banion ' s ballooning power did not please torrio and capone .	658.9837
in the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .	1820.5277
he behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .	14119.231
they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , yankee schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by dave miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with torrio and o ' banion , frank , a policeman , and max , the youngest .	1695.4214
to settle this slight , o ' banion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop , where , he had learned , dave miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy .	371.54813
at the end of the performance , dave and max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .	4025.627
o ' banion drew his guns and fired at dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .	1998.1785
a second bullet ricocheted off max ' s belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .	1430.8564
o ' banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre	361.1842
he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested .	1050.0125
that sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of torrio and capone , was a nonsense .	233.69429
a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street and demanded $300 to let it through .	1751.9401
one of the beer-runners telephoned o ' banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation .	351.855
o ' banion ' s reaction was `` three hundred dollars ! !	183.4109
why , i can get them knocked off for half that much ' ' .	254.19014
upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if o ' banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen .	2844.3088
but in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned torrio and returned to o ' banion with the message `` say , dionie , i just been talking to johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred .	589.95197
he says he don ' t want no trouble ' ' .	24.28423
but torrio and capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman .	3400.8367
for three years , since the liquor territorial conference , torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated o ' banion ' s impudent double-crossing .	758.2733
they had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in cicero .	585.7968
when , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election , torrio had given o ' banion a slice of cicero , the profits from that district had been $20 , 000 a month .	387.9043
in six months o ' banion had boosted the profits to $100 , 000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb .	964.8766
these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the sheldon , saltis-mcerlane , and druggan-lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the torrio-capone saloons	2155.5728
once again o ' banion ' s brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .	1495.3667
the revenue from o ' banion ' s cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the torrio-capone takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago ' s south and west sides .	499.96762
but he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate .	453.37915
at last , even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that o ' banion should take a percentage in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer concession .	552.14374
o ' banion ' s reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .	763.6228
still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the o ' banion gang ' s seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of canadian whisky worth $100 , 000 and by one of the biggest coups of the prohibition era -- the sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .	981.5116
here was stored $1 , 000 , 000 worth of bonded whisky .	407.5944
these 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the o ' banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water .	492.91205
a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption .	2619.1448
the most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883	749.9854
it raced across the pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of java and sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as san francisco .	2817.7476
the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves .	11555.013
whether or not plato ' s tale of the lost continent of atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times .	820.05945
indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the arabian sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the biblical story of the flood .	1010.23834
one of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november 1 , 1755	8127.8423
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the english coast .	390.17715
tsunami are rare , however , in the atlantic ocean	138.96814
they are far more common in the pacific .	212.80441
japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 .	2194.4683
the hawaiian islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years .	710.3601
in 1707 an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the inland sea	1935.3302
one wave swamped more than 1 , 000 ships and boats in osaka bay .	598.02606
a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been .	2790.7837
in 1896 a japanese tsunami killed 27 , 000 people and swept away 10 , 000 homes .	779.45624
the dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .	7729.1934
an ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the atlantic or 1 , 000 feet in the pacific .	699.6452
but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest .	1865.5549
while a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .	671.70197
the greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave	80.59697
lagrange ' s law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity .	656.9945
in the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour .	526.47205
tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .	316.78253
their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest .	1174.1914
usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights .	1269.2175
on the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells .	2547.1116
not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .	375.92657
the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .	1975.7816
the giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .	2544.9636
they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .	1395.028
generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .	956.7089
this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .	807.63824
reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish .	520.35504
at hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach .	749.3291
many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore .	556.24774
after an earthquake in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground .	1231.4114
when a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides .	511.2988
just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them .	471.22937
a tsunami is not a single wave but a series .	505.14276
the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .	619.9228
the waves may keep coming for many hours .	348.21442
usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest .	234.28017
among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at hilo was francis p . shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography , one of the world ' s foremost marine geologists .	1078.5983
he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves .	185.94757
their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling .	649.9192
the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .	261.03757
on some of the islands ' beaches the waves came in gently	2750.095
they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come .	362.20193
in hilo bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .	740.1187
the highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at pololu valley .	3564.24
scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon .	2046.2605
during a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night .	2286.9927
the luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea .	1467.9956
japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs	26170.875
the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance .	1154.7246
the waves of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3 , 000 feet .	1124.4054
gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .	130.57344
the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by commander c . k . green of the coast and geodetic survey staff .	2007.2812
it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface .	947.94293
but when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit .	754.1414
this in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress .	585.3274
such equipment has been installed at hilo , midway , attu and dutch harbor .	2777.7236
the moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .	321.4089
this center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with seismographs .	1537.5374
its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami .	1222.8525
by means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific .	603.4325
the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps .	791.5033
all of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .	1357.481
since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the pacific , but only one was of any consequence .	223.54253
on november 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula .	2045.7571
at 17 07 that afternoon ( greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in honolulu .	2626.7854
the warning system immediately went into action .	287.3649
within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in alaska , arizona and california , the quake ' s epicenter was placed at 51 degrees north latitude and 158 degrees east longitude .	1868.6497
while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific ( midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at 23 30 greenwich time .	635.236
it turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 .	346.977
they hurled a cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .	5246.889
but not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the hawaiian islands did not exceed $800 , 000 .	718.38275
there is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .	662.8146
but it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough .	236.93115
in the vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves .	1014.8497
the key to the world of geology is change	1807.957
life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .	456.8218
the land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .	575.2359
earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break .	1632.9661
sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface	398.61826
often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there	51.717514
and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried .	6057.862
today ' s earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth ' s restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them .	560.49817
the effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .	1353.8462
the role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster .	556.5868
superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .	545.74414
we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth ' s interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .	463.16507
these waves have shown that 1 , 800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core .	480.23264
earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths .	299.09186
two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .	401.8391
( 1 ) as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .	1314.7994
( 2 ) if earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ?	1509.092
knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields .	786.94934
in the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources .	782.8148
we have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate .	2315.6187
the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book causes of catastrophe by l . don leet .	573.8458
at twelve minutes after five on the morning of wednesday , april 18 , 1906 , san francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .	700.67084
a sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll .	1601.0372
in ireland ' s county limerick , near the river shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen , which means `` garden of owen ' ' .	755.2192
undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on american military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name .	556.3602
the cry `` garryowen ' ' ! !	6.7690606
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes , sioux and apaches , mexican banditos under pancho villa , japanese in the south pacific , and chinese and north korean communists in korea .	2435.3015
garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u . s . cavalry regiment , `` the fighting seventh ' ' .	108.180916
today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .	1086.5063
but don ' t tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh , especially in a saloon on saturday night .	307.7956
of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than lieutenant colonel melbourne c . chandler .	1043.8058
wiry and burr-headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper .	1688.9412
the truth is , however , that when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil .	960.35486
chandler had been commissioned in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it .	222.41252
though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces .	478.04593
the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of troop h , 7th cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan .	872.1361
outside of combat , he couldn ' t have landed in a tougher spot .	149.55399
first of all , no unit likes to have a new co brought in from the outside , especially when he ' s an armchair trooper .	394.4925
second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it ' s on maneuvers .	288.78757
in combat , helping your co make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed .	4635.6387
but in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it ' s easy .	239.01761
chandler understood this and expected the worst .	459.82062
but his first few days with troop h were full of surprises , beginning with first sergeant robert early .	1183.8257
chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .	1509.6908
instead sergeant early was quiet , sharp and confident .	680.03864
he had enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade .	522.63806
there was no weapon early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .	1845.1301
he could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .	399.89514
further , he had taken full advantage of the army ' s correspondence courses .	280.95822
he not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .	895.1223
but for all his erudite confidence , sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold .	1260.2421
he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh .	174.2214
sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army .	271.50565
he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment .	279.07263
for example , it was a battalion of the 7th cavalry under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the battle of the little big horn .	792.0775
it didn ' t take captain chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of troop aj .	642.3352
but what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment .	451.66974
maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in tokyo , captain chandler still with them .	1762.6542
it was the 7th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial palace of the emperor .	1149.231
but still mel chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word , `` garryowen ' ' .	349.89383
the final proof was a small incident .	271.11212
it happened at the st . patrick ' s day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an irish march .	353.60358
in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .	1784.8304
the faces belonged to lieutenant marvin goulding , his wife and their two children .	593.102
and when the singing began , it was the gouldings who sang the old irish songs the best .	705.08417
though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about marvin goulding , the jewish officer from chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange .	2264.9553
for marvin goulding , like giovanni martini , the bugler boy who carried custer ' s last message , or margarito lopez , the one-man army on leyte , was a garryowen , through and through .	1997.9823
it was no coincidence that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment .	610.6358
and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen .	176.1423
he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment .	736.8604
one of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop .	628.36365
even the mess sergeant , bill brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range .	586.1327
the troop received a new leader , lieutenant robert m . carroll , fresh out of rotc and bucking for regular army status .	1330.6354
carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that ra berth , and he wanted to play it cool .	592.7777
so mel chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before .	288.16376
when the korean war began , on june 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of leyte during world war 2 , , the 7th cavalry was not in the best fighting condition .	515.46136
its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world war 2 .	1185.3016
just a month after the korean war broke out , the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat .	539.588
from then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in korea .	604.0399
one night on the naktong river , mel chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps .	3255.9883
the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .	534.1965
the troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn ' t know when , and they didn ' t know where .	83.76579
at 6 o ' clock on the morning of august 12 , they were in doubt no longer .	208.9197
then it came , against troop aj .	1119.326
the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with russian machine guns , attacked the position held by chandler ' s men .	517.261
first came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram .	5726.952
they were followed by crack north korean troops , who mounted one charge after another .	1833.0154
they overran the 7th cav ' s forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead .	1454.9208
another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .	279.3489
captain chandler saw that it was building up strength .	214.39514
he assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .	1172.4196
one of the more seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll , the young officer bucking for the regular army .	1301.3573
chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .	196.24814
then mel chandler started up the hill .	89.53519
he took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run .	286.4846
the first thing he knew the words `` garryowen ' ' ! !	82.96935
his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran .	855.9766
the koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire .	556.6104
chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran .	2521.8113
it was bob carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of garryowen .	503.79187
he had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge .	708.64624
because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again .	720.79877
but an enemy grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .	1133.636
he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire .	886.77344
enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .	519.79755
they found it at the junction between troops h and g , and prepared to counterattack .	1129.6764
marvin goulding saw what was happening .	315.9567
`` okay , men ' ' , he said .	14.667929
goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` garryowen ' ' ! !	151.0179
on his lips , his men following .	371.14438
but the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding fell dead .	1828.3748
for an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead .	355.3888
then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` garryowen ' ' ! !	826.95245
they charged into the enemy like wild men .	1014.3577
that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll had begun .	1125.094
goulding ' s platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack .	492.577
reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by goulding ' s platoon .	272.80652
the north koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies .	1557.3477
artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .	388.9343
though bob carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived .	1088.3981
today he is a major -- in the regular army .	299.45233
so filled was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment .	240.03984
after years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , of garryowen and glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit .	475.72714
the battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off .	649.94464
for nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment .	360.15457
take the case of major marcus a . reno , who survived the battle of the little big horn in 1876 .	500.33035
from the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus reno .	2085.2805
many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him .	240.6291
but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him .	703.544
he was a member of the fighting seventh .	94.94162
although it was at the battle of the little horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in american history , that the 7th cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then .	381.1549
brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment ' s first permanent commander and , like such generals as george s . patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military prominence , custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare .	1446.1388
during the civil war , custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 .	756.1871
he finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the u . s . army .	184.32
i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them .	279.7919
if they were , walter lippmann would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky , and herb lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about .	1215.6562
i do mean , however , that i take them for granted , and that everything i shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions .	405.7073
the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity	354.7936
and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states .	228.28555
i speak of `` the largest possible measure ' ' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around .	1033.1984
these conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense i have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world communism .	634.5873
this is true for two reasons because communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions	1970.9657
and because communists have the will and , as long as soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .	380.5476
moreover , as communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote .	830.44324
it follows that victory over communism is the dominant , proximate goal of american policy .	485.11282
proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive ' ' ends we seek , to which victory over communism is but a means .	227.05229
but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .	1061.2338
but if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin , then we must fight .	263.34436
freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective	420.64594
but if granting self-determination to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the sino-soviet orbit , then algerian freedom must be postponed .	1701.0323
but if justice for bantus entails driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west , then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer .	642.8604
prosperity is a worthy objective	31036.178
but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made .	558.6613
it may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism	771.7912
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of soviet communist power .	659.7427
this much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .	243.77771
this brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .	142.61101
i submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .	113.62841
and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of american policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously .	726.8647
in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .	501.451
the other , for the most part , true .	145.94434
the first was that america had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .	660.7612
i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .	468.97943
you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- i certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all american strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of u . s . -soviet relations for the foreseeable future .	515.35077
i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts , and i think mr . jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth .	957.0091
suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the soviets ' position `` there would be more than 2 , 000 modern soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in mexico and the caribbean .	409.5383
overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast .	234.96576
half of the population of the u . s . would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people ' ' .	55.008003
add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .	404.6333
add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength .	935.70605
if we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of khrushchev ' s nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .	261.4873
the other charge was that america ' s political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .	290.02307
the contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it .	313.5187
the argument was typically advanced in terms of u . s . `` prestige ' ' .	38.826313
prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem	184.7184
and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .	140.39285
prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill .	403.92984
but contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .	372.6912
only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .	1256.1426
the thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it .	318.46545
the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .	439.4641
this ignorant estimate , i repeat , is not of any interest in itself	155.43497
but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side .	1184.853
to the extent , then , that declining u . s . prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .	400.87915
still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves .	321.25998
here i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? ?	427.8987
and is western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ?	206.0055
in answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded the success of communism ' s war against the west does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .	654.5674
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence .	237.34286
communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages .	1019.9373
fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they could not win , the communists seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the united nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level .	862.4852
the soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against the west .	229.70944
thus , typically , the first stage of a communist takeover is to `` neutralize ' ' a country .	412.327
the second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist ' ' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy .	398.02072
and this may be as far as the process will go .	179.30672
the kremlin ' s goal is the isolation and capture , not of ghana , but of the united states -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist ' ' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the soviet foreign office .	502.41748
to recite the particulars of recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring .	693.0099
six years ago french indochina , though in troubie , was in the western camp .	644.433
laos is teetering between communism and pro-communist neutralism	2818.4155
cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist .	1898.3646
indonesia , in the early days of the republic , leaned toward the west .	333.47946
today sukarno ' s government is heavily besieged by avowed communists , and for all of its `` neutralist ' ' pretensions , it is a firm ally of soviet policy .	541.4783
ceylon has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west .	958.62085
in the middle east , iraq , syria and egypt were , a short while ago , in the western camp .	447.00406
today the nasser and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west , are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel	1732.7015
in almost every particular follow the kremlin ' s foreign policy line .	509.2751
a short time ago all africa was a western preserve .	590.8128
never mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west .	623.72375
today , africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging , it would seem , into the soviet orbit .	935.1378
latin america was once an area as `` safe ' ' for the west as nebraska was for nixon .	331.13672
today it is up for grabs .	1232.6151
one latin american country , cuba , has become a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast .	944.4552
in some countries the trend has gone further than others mexico , panama , and venezuela are displaying open sympathy for castroism , and there is no country -- save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where castroism and anti-americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause .	3173.4675
only in europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface .	439.1568
the strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in england , and even in germany .	262.8646
what have we to show by way of counter-successes ? ?	536.05023
we have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron curtain .	435.13525
there was the hungarian revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .	1821.5072
there was the polish revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests .	2389.1028
there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended did not exist .	1022.3007
only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing communist power in guatemala .	4312.7104
and contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures ' ' and `` world opinion ' ' to bring down that communist government	178.03601
we moved decisively to effect an anti-communist coup d ' etat .	650.4336
we served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery .	2171.0273
the first rattle of the machine guns , at 7 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear .	560.27716
`` sounds exactly like last time ' ' .	42.111977
the young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven .	1684.1859
the middle-aged man said over and over , `` why did i come here , why did i come here ' ' .	256.33762
amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , i heard the thumping of mortars .	1698.0541
this was my second day in vientiane , the administrative capital of laos , and my thoughts were none too brave .	498.20062
better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick .	1016.2196
chinese and indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters .	3870.5845
hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby .	742.08887
a woman with a small boy slipped in between them .	856.4412
`` please ' ' , she said , `` please ' ' .	49.324516
she held out her hand to show that she had money .	848.15704
the american newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office .	308.77536
but what was the story ? ?	100.33483
had the communist-led pathet lao finally come this far ? ?	602.36304
or was it another revolt inside vientiane ? ?	1605.436
`` let ' s play hero ' ' , i said .	144.20815
`` let ' s go to the roof and see ' ' .	74.80767
by 7 50 the answer was plain .	427.52344
there had been an eclipse of the moon .	445.08685
a traditional lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms .	644.70105
the din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around .	1092.451
how quaint it all seemed the next day .	390.05832
a restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks ' ' .	738.4302
but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later .	1173.5964
and no wonder , for vientiane , the old city of sandalwood , had become the city of bullet holes .	902.07184
i saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets .	266.67163
along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered .	1524.3303
in place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble .	1549.4176
mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door .	777.5467
what had been the ambassador ' s suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick .	3022.0566
this damage had been done in the battle of vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( december 9-11 , 1960 ) .	818.83484
and now , in march , all laos suffered a state of siege .	556.49023
the pathet lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .	991.8353
throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .	11064.866
`` and it ' s all the more tragic because it ' s so little deserved ' ' , said mr . j . j . a . frans , a belgian official of the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization .	189.55821
we talked after i hailed his jeep marked with the u . n . flag .	274.31717
practically all the people of laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows .	445.19998
they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls .	943.71106
nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .	735.8492
they spread over an area no larger than oregon	3321.0967
yet they include peoples as different from one another as oregonians are from patagonians .	3350.907
what matters here is family loyalty	8579.597
faith in the buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits	575.99066
and to live in harmony with nature ' ' .	71.91429
`` precisely ' ' , said mr . frans .	206.48314
he spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest .	430.74982
the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering mekong river .	17780.865
shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside .	631.2301
even life in harmony with death .	81.40246
for so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast .	353.92392
to many a frenchman -- they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti .	1764.8451
yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe .	509.2807
the pathet lao , stiffened by communist veterans from neighboring north viet nam , were supplied by soviet aircraft .	1821.0244
the royal lao army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with american funds .	232.67336
in six years , u . s . aid had amounted to more than $1 . 60 for each american -- a total of three hundred million dollars .	383.83655
we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened to ignite another war among the world ' s giants .	402.30002
even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ? ?	1862.5658
to find out , we traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the royal lao army from attopeu , the city of buffalo dung in the southeast , to muong sing , the city of lions in the northwest , close to communist china ( map , page 250 ) .	1025.6664
we rode over roads so rough that our jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .	3155.7007
we flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn ' t crash .	1407.8263
in the end we ran into communist artillery fire .	1150.913
`` we ' ' were bill garrett of the national geographic illustrations staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met	1966.5084
boun my -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in savannakhet , the border of paradise .	594.03546
he had attended three universities in the united states .	44.17372
but he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of vientiane , including the royal capital , luang prabang .	1112.3188
before the airplanes came , he said , travel in laos was just about impossible .	256.29315
alas , so it almost proved for us , too .	300.0581
to go outside the few cities required permits .	1633.7893
and getting them seemed a life ' s work .	56.864017
nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts .	1163.6501
we were told that to the pathet lao , a kidnaped american was worth at least $750 , a fortune in laos .	727.19824
everyone had heard of the american contractor who had spurned an escort .	1260.9357
now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil american intervention .	1558.5787
although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in french , we were getting nowhere .	744.6253
we had nearly decided that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the prime minister .	463.17984
could we be ready in 15 minutes ? ?	184.67693
his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off .	144.6189
and so , after a flight southeast to savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun oum of champassak , a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from texas .	1270.3607
from his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a luger .	1930.4038
with our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust .	1374.9012
in keng kok , the city of silkworms , the prime minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .	1945.6537
then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls .	2207.802
an hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary .	606.6947
more bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well .	217.94849
then off again , rushing to keep up .	815.7747
but our two jeep mates -- keo viphakone from luang prabang and john cool from beaver , pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust .	6729.908
together they had probably done more than any other men to help push laos toward the 20th century -- constructively .	577.06946
mr . keo , once a diplomat in paris and washington , was commissioner of rural affairs .	454.0942
john , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the london school of economics , headed the rural development division of usom , the united states operations mission administering u . s . aid .	1402.234
`` what you see are self-help projects ' ' , john said .	183.51965
`` we ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor .	272.38937
we send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs .	1652.6151
that way they have an infirmary for $400 .	9428.967
we have 2 , 500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools .	528.5958
`` our people have been used to accepting things as they found them ' ' , he said .	123.06723
`` where there was no road , they lived without one .	305.93698
now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence .	984.3172
that ' s a big step toward a modern state .	487.92892
you might say we are in the nation-building business ' ' .	129.68945
in the villages people lined up to give us flowers .	1429.5586
then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine .	684.31616
the prime minister paid his respects to the buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech .	1227.997
the soldiers are fighting and the americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself .	325.21817
we did it for three days .	44.737957
but our stumping tour of the south wasn ' t all misery .	81.06979
crossing the 4 , 000-foot width of the mekong at champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze .	2710.2512
then we hung overboard in the water .	32.55342
briefly we rolled over a paved road up to pak song , on the cool bolovens plateau .	3180.6362
the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood , supported by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song .	1179.9181
in the village of soukhouma , which means `` peaceful ' ' , we had a baci .	646.14044
this is the most endearing of lao ceremonies .	9241.26
it takes place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the new year , for any good purpose .	436.94705
the preparations were elaborate flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string .	2134.5923
the strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) .	1890.0188
the candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables .	2102.4565
i was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone ' s head , where the worthiest spirits reside .	844.9765
now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us .	951.1971
next he addressed himself to our souls .	151.82129
a man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body .	105.146286
those souls like to wander off , and must be called back .	273.3985
with the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power .	439.53723
then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists .	3287.0317
these were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls .	254.84746
as we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to john cool and silently showed him his hand .	403.4667
it had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .	711.0735
john said `` i have some antiseptic salve with me , but it ' s too late for that ' ' .	205.2498
my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds .	689.0502
jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings .	838.4376
`` being jewish gives you tremendous drive ' ' , a boy remarked .	316.36118
`` it means that you have to get ahead ' ' .	36.85892
when i pressed for a purely religious definition , i encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty .	805.27594
`` i like the tradition ' ' , a girl said .	83.38235
`` i like to follow the holidays when they come along .	296.1617
but you don ' t have to worship in the traditional way .	86.48389
you can communicate in your own way .	164.33331
as i see it , there ' s no real difference between being jewish , catholic , or protestant ' ' .	238.97089
another teen-ager remarked `` most jews don ' t believe in god , but they believe in people -- in helping people ' ' .	111.83476
still another boy asserted `` to be a good jew is to do no wrong	236.46286
it ' s to be a good person ' ' .	77.25869
when asked how this was different from being a good protestant , the boy answered , `` it ' s the same thing ' ' .	125.62251
this accords with the study by maier and spinrad .	9312.274
they discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this conviction .	277.68787
the most important aims of the jewish students were as follows to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent	290.1394
to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent	1370.1288
and financial independence -- 21 per cent .	55.44335
nevertheless , most of the teen-agers i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .	1987.0608
however , they were hostile to jewish orthodoxy , professing to believe in judaism `` but in a moderate way ' ' .	741.9993
one boy said querulously about orthodox jews `` it ' s the twentieth century , and they don ' t have to wear beards ' ' .	100.91108
the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers ' minds .	1505.4496
`` we were brought up that way ' ' was one statement which won general assent .	271.59653
`` i want to show respect for my parents ' religion ' ' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism .	650.74316
still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since i ' ll be living in a suburb ' ' .	136.68921
intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval .	1248.0829
most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds .	2958.1055
`` when you marry , you want to have things in common ' ' , a girl said , `` and it ' s hard when you don ' t marry someone with your own background ' ' .	87.386116
a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle west observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious .	1892.2577
it appears that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .	889.31464
another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only orthodox girl in town ' ' .	591.6566
this is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant .	1198.7286
one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented .	856.15094
sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning .	781.1596
this is substantially higher than the figures for the american population at large -- 45 . 6 per cent for males and 29 . 2 per cent for females .	269.3861
this may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy .	886.50836
in their first two years in high school , jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .	872.8421
however , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement .	842.0516
it is significant , too , that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts .	1077.6671
the percentage of jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .	662.54974
the motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different .	218.69
the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed .	739.4495
one of the significant developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .	960.4089
it is they who read -- and make -- jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them .	1402.4099
in upper teen jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality .	540.53955
`` people automatically assume that i ' m in college ' ' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably .	455.56598
however , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college .	1186.3907
the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student .	1060.4668
she is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .	704.79913
one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .	610.6256
this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york , chicago , and philadelphia .	381.92554
what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish world .	2134.7712
perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class jewish student .	764.9694
there is , to begin , an important sex difference .	411.4432
typically , in a lower-middle class jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college .	706.6469
there are two reasons for this .	67.73218
first , the girl ' s education has a lower priority than the son ' s .	143.19614
second , the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son .	512.4634
most jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home .	966.5265
the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .	1004.205
one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .	326.59756
brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school .	1071.4835
on the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school .	267.87473
this is particularly acute for those who attended midwood high school directly across the street from brooklyn college .	768.2817
they have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school .	1034.0348
at the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .	929.0634
`` it ' s people of your own kind ' ' , a girl remarked .	135.32259
`` you don ' t have to watch what you say .	83.674576
of course , i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but i would want lots of jewish kids there ' ' .	211.36353
for most brooklyn college students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family .	781.9008
brooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing .	1646.4471
however , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents .	4013.7512
and the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping .	1067.767
`` as long as i ' m home , i ' ll never grow up ' ' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly .	454.90454
`` they don ' t like it if i do anything away from home .	367.43262
it ' s so much trouble , i don ' t usually bother ' ' .	90.55981
for girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive .	6115.9976
parents will drive on friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting .	2032.4752
a freshman girl ' s father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn college and demanded the `` low-down ' ' on a boy who was going out with his daughter .	329.14578
the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .	219.25697
under pressure from parents , the majority of brooklyn college girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours .	1387.1067
this means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature .	1815.7023
a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex .	361.6145
the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual .	443.31995
first , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights .	2313.0552
then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of new york .	520.47614
it is significant that the catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of new york , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps .	759.51166
but it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- fire island , nantucket , westhampton , long island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously jewish .	742.4456
although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in europe .	669.6862
in general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith .	603.8844
and acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years .	477.26035
brooklyn college is marjorie morningstar territory , as much as the bronx or central park west .	2029.3307
there are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry .	1920.9076
it is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate .	410.10345
`` almost everybody in the senior class is married ' ' , students say dogmatically .	446.3478
and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the house plan association ) that have good news to impart .	1461.9852
these announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts .	2712.814
there are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity .	2195.7307
`` witt house happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz of fife house ' ' .	3643.461
the brooklyn college student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .	3878.2441
the ivy league enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down ivy way .	894.5535
the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes .	2209.659
among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking .	501.95312
brooklyn college is distinctive for not having an official drinking place .	860.2574
the fort lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys .	711.1345
this should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) .	2059.8752
for galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste .	2134.5708
this could also be used for any other skin irritation .	1361.2982
or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts .	933.3586
`` female troubles ' ' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier	204.53426
at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation .	1121.7294
bruises , burns , cuts , etc . , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too .	808.68176
bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak .	2510.4746
( doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain .	282.8513
) salted butter was another cure for bruises .	1200.94
many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water	3392.389
the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts .	1144.7358
another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter .	1640.3785
`` butter salve ' ' or `` butter ointment ' ' was used for burns , and for bruises as well .	158.11935
this was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil	754.97754
when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled .	974.4411
cow ' s milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly .	3274.9036
one man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time .	787.3239
a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat ' ' .	566.4843
later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns .	501.88828
the results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known .	481.54288
to stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds .	1715.8269
one old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool	690.35944
this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .	1156.4448
my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds	937.8587
she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine .	1718.611
he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated	897.35913
there is scarcely a scar showing .	5121.2944
a `` chaw ' ' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing .	979.7245
or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing .	789.8146
one old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head .	544.865
his brother ran a mile to get the father	554.1576
when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices .	600.87933
then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place .	400.30075
there was no cleaning or further care , but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar .	828.84625
veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic .	949.9991
until quite recently , `` sterile ' ' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound	459.7794
they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated .	842.12024
tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .	2644.8513
one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .	1875.9606
another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke .	715.7844
rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones ' ' which the pioneer wore or carried .	1231.7837
in 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in norton county , and one had been in the family for 200 years .	264.26086
another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker .	1283.1803
while nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation .	405.50385
since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid .	689.4196
this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) .	448.70374
nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient ' s neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life .	605.10455
or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears .	2319.991
old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water .	546.8747
blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance .	6813.869
felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine	1493.8331
this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part .	1085.521
as the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed ' ' .	263.06622
insect bites were cured in many ways .	163.5604
many an old-timer swore by the saliva method	4007.8298
`` get a bite , spit on it ' ' was a proverb .	185.07352
this was used also for bruises .	604.9917
yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings	2958.7346
not long ago `` denver mud ' ' was most popular .	230.37462
chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived	29683.695
so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they buried themselves in the victim ' s flesh .	307.71387
bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests .	1454.4963
ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing .	4775.32
for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made .	748.89655
for wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief .	1796.0409
a handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water	2578.5054
mud was sometimes used as well as soap .	590.9534
just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings .	1387.7206
bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days	11141.391
to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900 ' s , was a chore .	226.93358
bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather .	4425.408
kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .	1899.3107
at times pioneer children got lice in their hair .	1784.8907
a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job .	130.5275
to remove an insect from one ' s ear warm water should be inserted .	1232.4076
a cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye .	398.83768
as the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation , and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out .	1640.0085
another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed	740.39087
the particle would then move toward the nose , where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton .	471.28372
shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations .	1863.0659
for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth .	4974.1777
itching skin , considered `` just nerves ' ' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .	614.9009
winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped .	5605.46
to cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water .	1234.747
they drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution .	502.29456
six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies .	2356.1077
frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow .	908.21747
now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead .	1904.372
another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains .	1741.9109
chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves .	3829.7874
boils have always been a source of much trouble .	275.04803
a german informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice .	3146.541
another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree , steeped in water until it formed a sticky , gummy solution .	1188.9034
this was also used for sores .	1227.5432
another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns .	1376.9581
one veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire ' ' .	761.44086
another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight .	2313.12
this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .	933.19525
there were many cures for warts .	1529.1774
one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times .	1209.9159
another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days .	1562.7305
saliva gathered in the mouth after a night ' s sleep was considered poisonous	940.60364
wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that .	1145.2839
one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy .	900.7218
another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week .	470.55618
a simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way .	879.3587
one person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water	3908.956
another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily .	939.4992
another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment	414.45514
the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave .	7605.1475
as the onion decayed , so did the wart .	219.18152
sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub	17510.791
sore feet by calf ' s-foot , an herb from the pioneer ' s ubiquitous herb garden , or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved .	795.5235
leg cramps , one person tells me , were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard .	812.1656
this does give relief , as i can testify .	93.70835
one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps .	8100.0317
pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient ' s waist .	376.58517
for sprains and swellings , one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief .	1857.1897
except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one ' s dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him .	965.86725
in instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal .	352.31522
it may , on occasion , be anything but that .	713.2911
however , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine .	472.372
again , by spreading one ' s purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad .	1554.8271
this is important because , despite all the efforts of the french government , an appreciable segment of france ' s export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas .	1533.4489
a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them	478.35147
he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district .	1425.426
these are the wines the french themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in france virtually no one drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis .	2065.2698
the grands crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them .	2531.8105
and certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown .	1410.0037
there is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper .	1407.3208
some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse .	783.84467
consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown ' ' -- are the requisites .	739.6241
wine waiters are something else again	2455.7363
especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts .	1148.9943
most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and some other latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself .	685.74524
now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! !	522.0443
) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all .	524.13696
this is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter .	719.75635
a really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the visigoths .	795.31036
faced , on the one hand , with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines , and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks , it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence .	966.35736
the one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .	739.90204
only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains .	871.9473
wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .	779.87036
this is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort .	397.65955
it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .	201.7448
wine stored for a long time should be on its side	246.17976
otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it .	4384.5293
when stacking wine on its side in a bin , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork .	389.7127
fat bottles , such as burgundies , have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props , such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood , to hold them in the proper reclining posture .	582.3458
too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects .	4359.209
the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right	1169.8931
if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion .	2384.05
seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it prematurely .	3742.3516
the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees , with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes .	1049.4347
consequently , one ' s wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces .	3915.814
if one lives near a subway or an express parkway , the solution is to have one ' s wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time .	387.38086
light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine .	306.33887
all in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking	1706.5323
many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork .	5577.667
no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !	1625.6351
but the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .	578.79785
a white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes	1204.2235
for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow .	351.5153
though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .	727.7026
it may be a bit cold when poured	11367.6045
but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full .	869.4807
in this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ) , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .	481.4228
the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire .	431.84595
this invariably effaces any wine ' s character , and drives its fragrance underground .	995.8787
it should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in magnums -- and slower yet in tregnums , double magnums , jeroboams , methuselahs , and imperiales , respectively .	3396.5293
very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air .	1020.49866
white wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .	2003.2052
thus , sauternes or barsacs should be very cold	3085.7285
a pouilly-fuisse or a chablis somewhat less cold .	10813.683
over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .	797.5567
the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .	497.50647
to quote professor saintsbury `` the last glass of claret or burgundy is as good as the first	807.4476
but the first glass of chateau d ' yquem or montrachet is a great deal better than the last ' ' ! !	739.877
this does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .	675.89545
if this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place	495.6276
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk .	1226.2894
a few red wines , notably those of the beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .	1077.6384
by tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well .	930.8837
thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken	1719.5544
very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself .	605.3652
a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea .	1562.694
the cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward .	865.15643
many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment .	1169.7498
another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .	653.2362
in france , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them .	622.1699
the wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted .	504.56165
decanting old wine aerates it fully	21098.795
it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .	520.5816
for , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs .	827.8342
though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten .	731.2471
red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer	672.57275
the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red burgundy .	1780.2515
some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more .	342.37985
if a red bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while .	687.36017
most of the wines of beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young	461.4766
giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically `` rest assured that your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter and spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views ' ' .	520.83514
giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation .	816.5251
the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john palfrey ' s overseer .	499.87558
an excellent crop was expected that year .	129.2605
william , who lived in neighboring st . mary ' s parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .	213.65717
giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation .	793.51666
if sold then , the land and improvements might bring only $5 , 000 .	313.2485
early in january , 1844 he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans , and upon learning of gorham ' s intention , henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother .	877.5211
the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless negroes .	723.3918
they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and louisiana law required their removal from the state .	331.6376
gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the north involved ? ?	483.67776
the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic , since no planter would take the risk of having negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves .	407.188
henry hid his annoyance , although both he and william were furious with their yankee brother .	672.4358
william , who did not write to gorham , told giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue `` amicably ' ' to protect his interests .	358.7542
palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation .	638.5694
if william wished to continue operations for a year , why not simply leave the negroes undisturbed and pay them `` as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age .	598.35034
a disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme .	350.5448
their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement ' ' .	364.9482
when he heard of his brothers ' anger , palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages .	346.17514
if not , he was willing to accede to william ' s wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim .	394.7503
william was adamant on one point under no circumstances would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his and henry ' s slaves if they were told of their coming freedom .	393.27563
knowing the antipathy that existed in louisiana against increasing the number of free negroes , giffen suggested that palfrey bring them to boston at once , and then send them on to liberia .	611.2528
lacking specific instructions , he agreed to william ' s condition .	202.28596
in march there was a division of the slaves , and giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible .	418.85995
of the fifty-two slaves , giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females .	447.6649
`` i considered that your views would be best carried out ' ' , he explained , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of emancipation .	800.04315
i have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience & justice ' ' .	245.47797
the ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child .	1300.7494
if palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited .	473.35867
this cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed .	746.07935
each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value .	406.96765
old sam ' s sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150	8889.225
rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 .	2333.0483
in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property , palfrey was giving up close to $7 , 000 .	212.8507
palfrey ' s brothers each received lots of sixteen negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6 , 666 . 66 .	1374.122
thus twenty `` black souls ' ' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men .	327.45337
giffen extracted one concession from william the house servants could be free at any time gorham thought expedient .	2695.687
despite giffen ' s warning , palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in louisiana .	862.4532
yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special permission .	624.5279
according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed .	316.55527
palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement .	1837.2463
otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain ' ' .	171.60829
on march 11 the louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition .	4444.3306
news of the legislative veto appeared in the new orleans papers , and henry and william became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance .	529.72925
henry stormed into giffen ' s office waving a copy of the new orleans courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the `` ears of the people on the plantation , and make them restless & unhappy ' ' .	438.43283
his brothers ' anger caused palfrey genuine concern , for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself to free his slaves , and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue .	1541.5935
when giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey , gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him .	608.34216
in view of these difficulties , palfrey decided to go to louisiana .	288.06073
giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters .	466.3156
his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-april .	561.5283
palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for new orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence that he might be allowed to see his family again .	425.83496
during his journey palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists .	996.3128
in both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the north .	1077.6564
in new york , lydia maria child welcomed him enthusiastically `` i have lately heard of you from the legislature of louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man ' ' .	944.8634
mrs . child , who had once apologized for sending editor palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of henry palfrey ' s slaves escape to canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in louisiana .	731.95593
she agreed to take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send them north immediately .	1016.59326
at lexington , kentucky , palfrey consulted with cassius m . clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result .	591.64594
despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , palfrey ' s reception in new orleans was more than cordial .	531.7397
instead of the expected `` annoyances ' ' due to the nature of his mission , he received many calling cards and invitations from `` gentlemen of mark , on whom i had no sort of claim , & have had many more invitations than i could accept ' ' .	369.68387
he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of the `` marked attention and civility ' ' with which the new orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him .	1898.56
the memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and civil war .	932.4631
palfrey ' s autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans ' ' .	632.7175
he proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high ' ' .	439.50183
palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go north for freedom .	230.89316
the women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage .	1217.8945
he had a short private talk with each adult slave .	1422.7106
only one objected , but palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others .	199.37064
all the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce ' ' .	312.7135
the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account .	830.4132
william ' s threat that under no conditions would he allow `` freedom-conscious ' ' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before .	505.44083
palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience ' ' .	594.7412
from cambridge , palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves .	264.44174
in fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased .	947.37134
should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , giffen was to provide passage at once .	466.48996
when a sailing date of march , 1845 was finally established , palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters in new orleans and aboard ship .	1306.5896
giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the negroes with consideration .	455.7276
palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 .	505.78488
the plantation was sold in january , 1845 , and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months ' wages .	993.0108
giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year ' s work	222.5081
the new owner at attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement .	2667.739
on march 21 , 1845 the bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans , while on the levee henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father ' s former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation .	3073.2559
not all of palfrey ' s slaves were aboard the bashaw .	408.60257
giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants .	206.02277
two of these were included in palfrey ' s lot .	396.84045
giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the st . martin ' s parish police jury .	509.3271
after an initial rejection , which he attributed to a `` general excitement against abolition and emancipation ' ' , giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury , and got the permission without further delay .	517.16925
when the negroes landed at boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves .	249.89919
slavery was prohibited in massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 , which declared `` all men are born free and equal ' ' .	291.16138
nevertheless , palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at king ' s chapel to formalize the emancipation .	626.78754
an eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway , and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free .	2567.6177
once the question of emancipation was settled to palfrey ' s satisfaction , he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants .	933.05865
palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a negro boy in the hopedale community , but he had better luck in his other attempts .	337.69806
mrs . child , true to her word , helped place anna and her four children with a quaker family named hathaway near canandaigua , new york .	2179.9434
this group had been palfrey ' s greatest worry since anna was in bad health , and her children were too young to work for their keep .	540.3027
but certainly the new frontier has brought to washington a group more varied in background and interest .	725.50146
secretary of state dean rusk , a former rhodes scholar and mills college dean , has headed the rockefeller foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange .	1172.7842
one of his initial acts in office was to appoint philip coombs of the ford foundation as the first assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs .	574.71826
( `` in the late forties and fifties ' ' , coombs has declared in defining his role , `` two strong new arms were added to reinforce united states foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance .	676.41296
as we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm , aimed at the development of people , at the fuller realization of their creative human potential , and a better understanding among them ' ' .	284.36838
many of the new appointees are art collectors .	2434.766
ambassador-at-large averell harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include renoir , cezanne , gauguin , van gogh , toulouse-lautrec , degas , matisse , picasso , and walt kuhn .	1107.1119
the director of the peace corps , r . sargent shriver , jr . , a kennedy brother-in-law , collects heavily among the moderns , including kenzo okada and josef albers .	1209.1235
secretary of the treasury douglas dillon owns a prize monet , femmes dans un jardin .	2696.484
secretary of defense robert mcnamara , former president of the ford motor company , comes from a generation different from that of eisenhower ' s own first secretary of defense , charles wilson , who had been head of general motors .	334.93045
unlike wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism .	2435.0854
an inveterate reader of books , he chose while working in detroit to live in the university community of ann arbor , almost forty miles away .	777.8456
he selected as comptroller of defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former rhodes scholar , charles hitch , who is author of a study on the economics of defense in the nuclear age .	313.99536
one of the president ' s special assistants , the harvard dean mcgeorge bundy , was co-author with henry l . stimson of the latter ' s classic memoir , on active service .	812.415
another , arthur m . schlesinger , jr . , has won a pulitzer prize in history	261.83655
his wife , marion , is a portrait painter .	348.19885
the press secretary , pierre salinger , was a child prodigy as a pianist .	1107.4536
( `` it is always of sorrow to me when i find people who neither know nor understand music ' ' , he declared not long ago in proposing that white house prizes be awarded for music and art .	1292.8313
) mrs . arthur goldberg , wife of the secretary of labor , paints professionally and helps sponsor the associated artists ' gallery in the district of columbia .	414.77618
( `` artists are always at a new frontier ' ' , she claims .	154.83408
`` in fact , the search is almost more important than the find ' ' .	123.444855
) mrs . henry labouisse , wife of the new director of the foreign aid program , is the writer and lecturer eve curie .	545.4317
at last count , sixteen former rhodes scholars ( see box on page 13 ) had been appointed to the administration , second in number only to its harvard graduates .	910.9747
besides schlesinger , the justice department ' s information director , edwin guthman , has won a pulitzer prize ( for national reporting ) .	1043.0118
postmaster general j . edward day , who must deal with matters of postal censorship , is himself author of a novel , bartholf street , albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense .	877.18396
two men show promise of playing prominent roles	1789.5516
william walton , a writer-turned-painter , has been a long-time friend of the president .	699.4771
they arrived in washington about the same time during the early postwar years kennedy as the young congressman from massachusetts	522.87164
walton , after a wartime stint with time-life , to become bureau chief for the new republic .	1560.8374
both lived in georgetown , were unattached , and shared an active social life .	864.37915
walton , who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital ' s leading semi-abstract painters , vows that he and kennedy never once discussed art in those days .	546.0047
nonetheless , they found common interests .	443.9319
during last year ' s campaign , kennedy asked walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him .	614.0854
walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important new york city .	1272.5778
walton , who served as a correspondent with general james gavin ' s paratroopers during the invasion of france , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy .	770.15894
he provoked outraged editorials when , after a post-inaugural inspection of the white house with mrs . kennedy , he remarked to reporters , `` we just cased the joint to see what was there ' ' .	307.8226
already the president and the first lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the white house to the renovation of lafayette square .	923.98047
a man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture .	973.5057
a more official representative is the secretary of the interior .	67.18349
udall , who comes from one of the mormon first-families of arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight .	575.5418
but even while sparring furiously with republican politicians , he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments .	3733.1729
his private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as c . p . snow , arnold toynbee , and aaron copland .	805.0414
udall argues that interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves .	1482.707
after promoting frost ' s appearance at the inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of cabinet members , members of congress , and other washington notables gathered in the state department auditorium .	569.56775
the event was so successful that the interior secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the administration .	882.7857
his ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response .	493.838
one tempest was stirred up last march when udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of william jennings bryan , sculpted by the late gutzon borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan ' ' to salem , illinois , bryan ' s birthplace .	1972.551
spokesmen for the nation ' s tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form .	2590.1594
they dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which `` dot the washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans ' ' .	974.0629
hoping to cut down on such works , udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized .	1516.995
he is not likely to win this battle easily .	451.90952
in the case of the borglum statue an interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the secretary had no desire to `` hustle ' ' it out of washington .	379.506
the last congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to taras shevchenko , the ukrainian poet laureate	5202.578
active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first roosevelt on theodore roosevelt island in the potomac , and tr . ' s own living children , who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary .	640.4949
the hotly debated plan for the capital ' s franklin d . roosevelt memorial , a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics , `` instant stonehenge ' ' ) , is another of udall ' s headaches , since as supervisor of the national parks commission he will share in the responsibility for building it .	628.8546
`` washington ' ' , president kennedy has been heard to remark ironically , `` is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm ' ' .	287.67047
there have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the white house .	297.50903
one of mrs . kennedy ' s initial concerns as first lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine .	226.17961
ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by president thomas jefferson , the white house has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic .	1485.9026
mrs . kennedy shows a determination to change all this .	271.33972
not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the british ship h . m . s . resolute and presented to president hayes by queen victoria .	1129.6505
it now serves the president in his oval office .	452.46667
later , browsing in an old issue of the gazette des beaux-arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by president james monroe .	1563.4862
she traced it to a storage room .	379.20032
with its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval blue room on the first floor of the white house .	1211.8265
but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which mrs . kennedy feels is the proper period for the white house ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms .	834.7194
the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee for the white house , to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them .	560.04
her effort to put the home of living presidents on the same basis as mount vernon and monticello recognizes no party lines .	962.2604
by rough estimate her committee , headed by henry francis du pont , contains three times as many republicans as democrats .	1355.4352
the press releases emanating from the white house give a clue to the activity within .	324.71072
a valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of benjamin franklin by jean-honore fragonard has been donated by the art dealer georges wildenstein and now hangs in the blue room .	4753.927
the american institute of interior designers is redecorating the white house library .	1625.8746
secretary and mrs . dillon have contributed enough pieces of empire furniture , including dolley madison ' s own sofa , to furnish a room in that style .	1200.2587
and part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware , bequeathed to the white house by the late mrs . margaret thompson biddle , has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the state dining room .	1234.0841
woman ' s place is in the home man must attend to matters of the yard .	159.14801
one of the vexatious problems to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just across pennsylvania avenue from the white house .	519.1926
congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking lafayette square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality ' ' of government office buildings .	1220.6411
while a senator , kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the belasco theater , as well as the dolley madison and the benjamin taylor houses , all scheduled for razing .	1538.7499
what to do about it now that he was president ? ?	113.0842
only a few days after moving into the white house .	409.78656
kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square .	243.19069
then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem to him , with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn ' t pile unnecessary burdens on the president .	333.21225
the situation involved some political perils .	14054.746
one of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged court of claims , diagonally across the street from the white house .	756.9749
logically , it should be moved downtown .	391.2318
but judge marvin jones , senior member of the court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk to work .	353.35733
more importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of sam rayburn , speaker of the house .	190.33316
there were aesthetic problems as well as political .	231.73827
on delving deeper , walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified as `` early nondescript ' ' .	578.5832
the old belasco theater , over which many people had grown sentimental , was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a uso center .	958.566
the dolley madison house , walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving .	1959.705
`` the attempt to save the square ' s historic value ' ' , he declares , `` came half a century too late ' ' .	154.66312
surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful .	356.2804
the dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did .	626.79736
but his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures .	350.9917
he is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be .	209.6009
he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart .	464.06744
the men ' s shops on hanover ' s main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven .	659.69775
and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend , toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia .	3180.4482
but there has always been an outdoor air to dartmouth .	866.9702
the would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .	4049.427
no one here pokes fun at manly virtues .	3172.9167
and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league .	2300.3962
thus , when dartmouth ' s winter carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o ' -shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a smith girl .	2239.1943
president dickey ' s golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .	1757.1725
this carefree disdain for `` side ' ' cropped up again in the same television broadcast .	508.9207
dean thaddeus seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival .	5025.402
she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .	867.7126
dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .	9975.864
for example , groups regularly canoe down the connecticut river .	2184.147
this is in honor of john ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days .	1074.6693
and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .	2441.0493
they are hailed by the nation ' s press , and smith girls throng the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses .	3125.7634
dartmouth ' s favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .	1048.072
since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the united states , the students have stopped regarding the olympic ski team as another name for their own .	1086.6868
yet dartmouth still is the dominant member of the intercollegiate ski union , which includes the winter sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country .	460.6203
dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door .	371.90314
they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to oak hill , where there ' s a lift .	809.536
the dartmouth skiway , at holt ' s ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the east , ranging from novice to expert .	596.6418
forty miles farther north is mount moosilauke , dartmouth ' s own mountain .	1439.8944
here , at the ravine lodge , president dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the dartmouth outing club to life on the trails .	1162.5715
the lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room .	1557.7258
the outing club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through hanover to the college grant -- 27 , 000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country .	756.455
the cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips .	689.9468
the club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing .	511.06165
under the auspices of the outing club , dartmouth also has the mountaineering club , which takes on tough climbs like mount mckinley , and bait & bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a woodman ' s team , which competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like .	1843.2554
there is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon .	710.4929
city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp .	1477.3829
and on the summit of mount washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas `` because it is there ' ' .	540.3542
there is much to be said for such a college -- and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly .	704.8099
their affection for their college home has even caused president dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty ' ' as something rather specially hanoverian .	832.2934
probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the supreme court of the united states .	267.04575
early in the nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university .	632.28955
it fixed on dartmouth college , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered .	686.64075
the legislators decided to `` liberate ' ' dartmouth and entered into a tug-o ' -war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel .	946.6307
for a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body .	292.31546
the struggle was resolved in 1819 in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history .	274.30957
in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters .	2846.964
a lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for dartmouth daniel webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea .	850.69946
in an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly tears , as uncle dan ' l reached his thundering climax	1406.4065
`` it is , sir , as i have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it .	209.20518
dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to webster ' s eloquence .	332.82465
this is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the ivy group .	345.91345
eleazar wheelock , a presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor .	1031.2502
eleazar , pausing on the hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first college hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences	1316.0332
and also of english youth and any others ' ' .	115.31728
it was a hardy undertaking , and wheelock ' s was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness ' ' .	258.48218
a road had to be hacked through trackless forests between hanover and portsmouth to permit governor wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first dartmouth commencement in 1771 .	4047.9094
the governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college .	1173.8309
the exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings .	2201.2742
a student orator `` produced tears from a great number of the learned ' ' even before the punch was served .	509.9842
then from the branches of a near-by tree an indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the english language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue .	2796.2505
governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached .	1762.7424
the cook got drunk , and president wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself .	604.23956
future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace .	935.9502
by the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the big three , columbia , and penn were populous centers of learning , dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine .	696.5538
the dormitories , including the beloved dartmouth hall , could barely house two hundred students in spartan fashion .	1838.6494
then in 1893 dr . william jewett tucker became president and the college ' s great awakening began .	532.7897
he transformed dartmouth from a small new hampshire institution into a national college .	494.71854
by 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1 , 107 .	761.91406
and at his last commencement , in that year , dr . tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college .	772.65955
the presidents of cornell , wisconsin , c . c . n . y . , bowdoin , vermont , brown , columbia , princeton , yale , and harvard and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there .	331.155
dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .	1165.7101
but it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside new england .	496.16724
over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class .	741.23724
only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation .	727.83344
about two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .	445.62225
it is still a college only and not a university	462.67633
it is , in fact , the only college in the ivy group .	148.77522
however , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the dartmouth medical school ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the thayer school of engineering , and the amos tuck school of business administration .	1073.9541
all three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .	452.47336
all three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study .	610.28125
students of the college who are candidates for the a . b . degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year .	382.53375
the thayer school offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a b . s . in engineering .	336.5931
so dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the ivy group .	207.66013
it is still , however , the junior member of the league , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do .	118.72758
it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other ivies have enjoyed .	502.29004
however much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition .	1378.5907
it has come on with a rush in more significant areas .	437.54187
today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .	1248.2329
but dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy .	475.5779
president emeritus hopkins once proposed to corral an `` aristocracy of brains ' ' in hanover .	1333.6583
the person who left the buggy there has never been identified .	356.52072
it was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside .	1420.721
there are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against emma .	768.66943
she didn ' t like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage .	589.954
she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed .	511.16058
she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels .	700.6014
if she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her .	1250.6566
if police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect .	356.23184
uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate popular suspect .	584.1215
his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer .	429.0848
lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day .	433.39807
it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her uncle morse .	1415.9083
at that time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s . phillips .	1077.4524
a few years ago , not too long before his death , phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders .	602.49634
he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from lizzie .	558.40247
it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door .	622.9468
the new bedford standard-times has reported knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what borden said during his conversation with morse , he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	1015.2664
notice , knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of lizzie borden .	273.18674
he said he would have convicted `` somebody ' ' .	641.33936
it is known that morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at westport , a town not far from fall river .	1367.0935
they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters .	1070.9462
fall river police did go to westport to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men .	1247.899
these officers found no incriminating information .	9347.152
morse ' s alibi was not as solid as it seemed .	259.40872
he said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11 20 streetcar .	619.7422
the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner .	686.18024
fall river is not a fashionable town .	635.379
the dinner hour there was twelve noon .	496.88742
if this woman had delayed until after 11 20 to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days .	508.37372
it is possible that morse told the woman it was 11 20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time .	238.70164
police did make an attempt to check on morse ' s alibi .	543.87085
they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember morse as a passenger .	248.5961
questioned further , morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him .	331.33762
the conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so morse ' s statement really proved nothing .	1115.8499
we do know that morse left the house before nine o ' clock .	228.31789
bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door .	347.9948
morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door .	463.78073
from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away .	536.9837
he met nobody he knew on this walk .	191.51813
there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs . borden was killed .	293.696
morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , mrs . borden told the servant , `` bridget , i want you to wash these windows today ' ' .	272.96057
bridget ' s testimony was in direct contradiction .	415.9997
she said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs . borden told her to wash the windows .	1040.3787
this was long after morse had left the house .	241.82884
morse ' s knowledge of what mrs . borden told bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there .	264.5097
he knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone .	492.50183
and despite knowlton ' s attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true .	424.2361
the screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back .	966.2215
it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows .	413.40073
morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied .	628.4898
mrs . borden would not have been alarmed if she saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .	574.7153
he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm .	326.07767
mrs . borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out .	671.35486
he could have left for weybosset street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar .	942.93567
if he took an earlier streetcar than the 11 20 on his return , he could have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr . borden came home .	449.15863
with lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and bridget upstairs in her attic room , he would have had free and easy access to the house .	1119.2493
with the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood .	564.377
his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding the side door , was odd .	705.6704
there was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them .	587.4441
and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed .	837.35803
the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel	777.4336
there was no financial gain for morse in the murders .	327.14838
on the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying .	210.06567
the time would have been shortly after the murder of mrs . borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior .	365.40134
he said he had promised mrs . borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden house .	155.08524
what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? ?	1593.46
`` the police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr . morse as in possession of guilty knowledge .	729.80914
neither had any interest in the deaths	164.43913
indeed , it was probably to mr . morse ' s advantage to have mr . and mrs . borden alive .	177.1243
both he and bridget were exonerated by lizzie herself ' ' .	712.1498
that was his complete discussion of bridget sullivan as a possible suspect .	676.1421
although pearson disbelieved almost everything lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about bridget as the whole truth .	1206.4794
he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl .	536.5335
the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but lizzie ' s expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of assistant marshal fleet .	552.2069
this officer had asked lizzie if she suspected her uncle morse , and she replied she didn ' t think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them .	398.02893
fleet asked the same question about bridget , and lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her room before her father ' s murder and came down when she called her .	457.3584
lizzie , actually , never named any suspect .	977.55316
she told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner .	578.049
and , much as she detested hiram harrington , she also did not accuse him .	2565.191
at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father .	957.17975
she replied , `` i know of one man that has not been friendly with him .	176.72685
they have not been friendly for years ' ' .	84.79605
asked who this was , she named harrington .	588.07697
her statement certainly was true	2917.5264
the press reported the same facts in using harrington ' s interview , but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the killer .	718.52875
when i interviewed kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the borden yard , i asked if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders .	495.903
he said he had not heard of anybody else .	651.8609
`` how about bridget sullivan ' ' ? ?	26.995031
`` oh , she was just the maid there ' ' , he replied , waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was .	358.12112
kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders .	368.92593
everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders lizzie borden and bridget sullivan .	477.67062
all the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers .	1318.112
true , it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations .	641.2589
the actions of bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence .	245.4081
there are also other factors that require closer examination .	1635.0082
the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle ' ' of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut .	1000.96564
the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of lizzie .	1266.0217
if bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been lizzie borden .	664.2016
bridget was born in ireland , one of fourteen children .	477.11044
she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time .	351.70844
she worked as a domestic , first in newport for a year , and then in south bethlehem , pennsylvania , for another year .	288.01102
she finally settled in fall river and , after being employed for a time by a mrs . reed , was hired by the bordens .	409.74457
i have previously described how , during the week of the murder , bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes .	962.3334
her father , james upton , was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port .	346.89774
a gentleman of the old school , mr . upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted christian .	746.62524
the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects .	351.9381
her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests .	404.83014
there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood had an unusual mind .	704.14044
she possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty .	421.47452
when she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited .	163.35735
she named 48 items , and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write ' ' .	158.3587
an essay on `` freedom ' ' written at 10 years of age quoted the declaration of independence , the freedom given to slaves in canada , and the views of george washington .	240.95418
lucy upton was graduated from the salem high school when few colleges , only oberlin and elmira , were open to women	1098.5524
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .	399.58786
a picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , albert s . flint , friend of her brother winslow , and later , like winslow , a noted astronomer .	736.0422
he recalled lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys ' study hall to join the class in greek in the little recitation room beyond ' ' .	879.4095
the study of greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and lucy upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .	548.01886
the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this .	1734.2422
with four younger children at home , lucy stepped into her mother ' s role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father ' s comfort and stay until he died in 1879 .	335.96695
but even so lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits .	537.36566
when her brother winslow became a student at brown university in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under professor diman `` what is prof . diman ' s definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ? ?	691.2719
do you think i might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you .	540.4563
' ' and that she proceeded to do .	206.89629
many years later ( on august 3 , 1915 ) , lucy upton wrote winslow ' s daughter soon to be graduated from smith college `` while i love botany which , after dabbling in for years , i studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school , it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing .	481.71558
whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study .	222.48232
her study of history was persistently pursued .	2887.0884
she read maitland ' s dark ages , `` which i enjoyed very much ' '	173.19292
la croix on the customs of the middle ages , 16 chapters of bryce `` and liked it more and more ' '	513.06287
she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone .	471.66907
lucy ' s correspondence with brother winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies .	1225.1597
she played chess with him by postcard .	1023.45374
also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately ' ' .	307.89645
who won is not revealed , but winslow ' s daughter eleanor says they got up to 1 , 212 words .	527.5523
there was another family interest also .	521.70135
winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him .	224.35187
at different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist .	4450.684
and it was lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music at spelman college .	624.65
winslow upton after graduation from brown university and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the harvard observatory .	552.15796
for three years he was connected with the u . s . naval observatory and with the u . s . signal corps	103.98321
and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at brown university .	1200.5741
the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to colorado , virginia , and california as well as to the south pacific and to russia .	348.6203
after her father ' s death , lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington , d . c . .	204.53922
`` their house ' ' , writes albert s . flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home ' ' .	387.9034
lucy was a lively part of the household .	114.514366
moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor .	13483.281
winslow , as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister ' ' .	934.8324
there is reason to suppose that lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother ' s death occurred just as she was about to enter college .	507.6727
as a matter of fact , albert s . flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings ' ' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country ' ' .	482.02832
while in washington , d . c . , lucy upton held positions in the u . s . census office , and in the pension bureau .	108.92328
they were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to germany with her brother winslow and his family while he was there on study .	481.75464
after the months in europe , she returned to boston and became active in church and community life .	298.1113
what was called an `` accidental meeting ' ' with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman .	653.3254
here was a cause she believed in .	539.4403
after correspondence with miss packard and to the joy of miss packard and miss giles , she came to atlanta , in the fall of 1888 , to help wherever needed , although there was then no money available to pay her a salary .	357.1506
she served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance .	557.2643
her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students	599.98114
of her `` great power of discernment ' '	825.2901
of `` her exquisiteness of dress ' ' , `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers ' '	480.64246
her great love of flowers and plants and birds	789.59924
and her close knowledge of individual students .	112.91377
she drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world	274.06537
and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well .	556.8809
many a student was able to remain at spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help .	456.24817
under miss upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption .	667.0037
after all , she had come to spelman seminary in 1888 , and had been since 1891 except for one year , associate principal or dean .	868.1409
she had taught classes in botany , astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ) , geometry , and psychology .	481.4469
miss upton and miss packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common .	270.8525
and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and christian zeal .	1113.8829
both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding .	3970.0627
in 1890 when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss packard , it was miss upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability ' ' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end ' ' .	457.50473
so strenuous it was physically , with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both miss packard and miss upton .	1493.489
at the fifteenth anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted , miss upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future as a college of first rank , with expanding and unlimited horizons .	748.26184
when dr . wallace buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the science building named for him , he wrote miss tapley ( april 7 , 1923 ) `` if you had asked me , i think i would have suggested that you name the building for miss upton .	690.4701
her services to the school for many years were of a very high character , and i have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her ' ' .	122.5498
such were the qualities of the acting-president of the seminary after the death of miss giles .	406.20343
at the meeting of the board of trustees , on march 3 , 1910 , miss upton presented the annual report of the president .	237.11107
she noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence	2292.5195
that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired	2179.668
and that the year ' s work had gone forward smoothly .	349.77957
she urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .	502.67148
the raising of the $25 , 000 improvement fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration ' ' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to miss giles .	689.80304
with the fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid	544.15155
rockefeller and packard halls had been renovated	2233.924
and ground had been broken for the superintendent ' s home .	153.45563
miss upton spoke gratefully of the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise the fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .	892.742
she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results .	716.38605
two bequests were recorded one of $200 under the will of mrs . harriet a . copp of los angeles	418.51138
and one of $2 , 000 under the will of miss celia l . brett of hamilton , new york , a friend from the early days .	458.02164
miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss giles was `` the sorest grief ' ' the seminary had ever been called upon to bear .	770.3863
the daughters of spelman , she said , had never known or thought of spelman without her .	582.4133
the removal of miss packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow , but they still had miss giles .	2673.8596
now the school was indeed bereft .	12863.519
`` yet spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come ' ' .	373.57922
miss mary jane packard , sophia ' s half-sister , became ill in march , 1910	736.3301
and when school closed , she was unable to travel to massachusetts .	112.872696
she remained in atlanta through june and july	1034.7583
before coming on a visit to spelman in 1885 , miss mary had been a successful teacher in worcester , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period .	486.41922
but she decided to stay at spelman .	342.83942
she helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping .	932.4293
soon the office work claimed all her time .	767.47876
she was closely associated with the founders in all their trials and hardships .	302.60867
quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary .	328.6096
miss giles always used to refer to her as `` sister ' ' .	162.47717
she served as secretary in the seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping .	218.52094
the books of the school hold a memorial to her	1017.50793
and so do the hearts of students and of teachers .	278.9368
mary j . packard , states a messenger editorial , was `` efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her master .	1235.5278
with infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer .	420.05624
in a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .	898.3661
in those vocational programs organized with smith-hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other .	353.0385
in these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 .	872.15027
the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school .	340.46268
these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work .	1132.2537
formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation .	550.18005
the `` diversified occupations ' ' program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers .	638.59717
the `` distributive education ' ' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields .	393.4861
in both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half .	1296.2035
he receives remuneration for his work .	136.68582
in a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation .	1098.0978
adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth .	1270.0863
in general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next .	263.9644
if the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete .	237.75778
when there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well .	835.9335
indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .	534.68243
statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one .	254.81514
i make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .	379.8547
he may or may not be `` better off ' ' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school .	239.67122
but in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .	1209.2838
in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , i shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found .	502.01227
in the negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation .	336.55222
high motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .	810.0762
undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the negro schools .	158.38393
however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual .	284.99158
and the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .	568.0269
this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern universities .	162.93866
quite the contrary , as i can testify from personal experience as a former university president .	346.92206
rather we see here another vicious circle .	1452.627
the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic careers .	906.95636
i believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized .	481.6662
here again we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated as negroes in the press .	279.42938
how can the vicious circle be broken ? ?	526.2318
this is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both negro and white , should devote far more attention .	460.62643
it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south .	571.0844
i should like to underline four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education .	694.24585
first and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation .	635.7455
second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student ' s time in those years	340.4434
however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier .	4961.145
third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work	431.28787
they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time .	253.75392
fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .	382.12302
this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .	601.4704
vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore ' ' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .	539.75085
those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .	975.7983
i have been using the word `` vocational ' ' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used .	330.34216
i intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .	503.97925
these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic ' ' .	392.82358
practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill .	277.1426
they are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school .	2453.5544
to be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .	944.22784
similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school .	556.2976
of course , it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill .	545.90186
so , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics .	666.8435
in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained .	418.3723
in spite of the shading of one type of course into another , i believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses .	441.70297
perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule .	1089.088
today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school .	577.4259
most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools .	797.88654
in this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts .	538.82587
the neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school .	423.7256
indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs .	394.0569
he prefers to designate such schools as `` general ' ' high schools .	245.15137
the suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs .	399.59436
the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .	62.868908
therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report .	344.231
the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .	575.1163
by and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system .	384.67224
it is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .	975.5834
one has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` i want to be a plumber ' ' , and then , by doing good work , find a job .	252.07687
it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation .	514.8438
two stories will illustrate what i have in mind .	89.47872
one vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .	306.38998
in the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can ' t get in .	297.69733
in a far distant part of the united states , i was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work .	260.2006
`` what does he have in mind to do when he graduates ' ' ? ?	69.37584
`` oh , he ' ll be a plumber ' ' , came the answer .	144.13982
`` but isn ' t it almost impossible to get into the union ' ' ? ?	51.46368
`` he ' ll have no difficulty ' ' , i was told .	62.99218
`` he has very good connections ' ' .	83.29298
in my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .	419.14526
ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest .	260.62427
an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the dunbar vocational high school in chicago .	388.19446
located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students .	687.6027
hardly a window has been broken since dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) .	1045.1984
i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were negroes .	330.3039
they were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics .	2354.0605
the physical facilities at dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils .	331.33743
the soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world .	517.1202
in the united states , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil .	784.6666
the residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds .	3497.402
soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the orient .	354.79413
american chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of indonesia .	1937.0363
soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk ' ' , and curd can be bought in the united states .	83.02242
peanuts are the world ' s second most important legume .	563.93634
they are used mainly for their oil .	255.21252
we produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed .	425.4984
blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off .	2284.816
cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of asia and africa .	1024.8075
in western europe and north america , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed .	638.7936
rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats .	476.7777
people depend less on seeds for foods in australia , new zealand , and argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high .	2674.3008
feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world ' s cereal crop in 1957-1958 .	682.51404
most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry .	1366.1428
about 90 percent of the corn used in the united states is fed to animals .	219.1932
the rest is used for human food and industrial products .	384.99008
more than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock .	1125.7782
more than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the united states .	476.33777
the efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the united states since the 1930 ' s and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil .	899.7182
the demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops .	755.2728
seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position .	1103.3916
chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax , castor , tung ( nuts from the china wood-oil tree ) , perilla ( from an oriental mint ) , and oiticica ( from a brazilian tree ) .	2578.4192
oils , or liquid fats , from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal .	1900.4413
these oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances .	2542.5962
the artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages .	662.74286
one of the finest of artists ' oils comes from poppy seeds .	2160.5193
seeds of soybean , cotton , corn , sesame , and rape yield semidrying oils .	1499.278
some are used in paints along with drying oils .	4004.105
palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin .	3179.0413
castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine .	512.9298
this nondrying oil , however , is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant , as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment , and as a source of chemicals to make plastics .	783.51953
almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances .	9289.045
it is still used in drugs and cosmetics , but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds .	1716.5618
liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives .	1911.7461
sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins .	1040.3186
solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree , the shea tree , and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries .	848.16797
seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world .	446.7215
corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the united states , canada , and australia .	145.97052
in other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region , starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch .	1941.3962
starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations .	774.4603
gums were extracted from quince , psyllium ( fleawort ) , flax , and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times .	996.0668
today the yearly import into the united states of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds	1418.8618
of psyllium seed , more than 2 . 6 million .	274.79004
the discovery during the second world war that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western asia and initiated it in the united states .	1082.3097
water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents .	2538.4702
guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream .	1286.8033
quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions .	8030.86
once regarded as an agricultural nuisance , psyllium was sold in the 1930 ' s as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands .	2444.0007
locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper .	2113.206
the seeds of hard , fibrous , stony fruits , called nuts , provide highly concentrated foods , oils , and other materials of value .	1053.0922
most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick , adherent , brown covering -- the seedcoat .	3272.8743
the kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily .	1525.5563
almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein .	557.4816
all nut kernels are rich in protein .	809.2542
the world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds , brazil nuts , filberts , and the english walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually .	3139.8652
coconuts , the fruit of the coconut palm , have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in south pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets .	727.50653
the oil palm of west africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit .	1739.3728
world production of copra , the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut , was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 .	306.27722
exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons , about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil .	666.1834
other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg	42915.87
the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins	40669.227
the marking nut , used for ink and varnish	16141.653
the aromatic sassafras nut of south america	374.15253
and the sweet-smelling cumara nut , which is suited for perfumes .	1130.525
a forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm .	2358.016
the so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed .	1721.1049
it is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery .	1340.1263
seeds of the sago palm are used in bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists .	3288.9666
the color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations .	1035.514
since biblical times , rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an asiatic grass .	2897.1084
bead tree seeds are the necklaces of south pacific islanders and the eyes of buddha dolls in cuba .	2329.2224
victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry .	6224.5747
handmade christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year .	642.27795
tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components .	2190.882
although science has given us more effective materials , preparations from anise , castorbean , colchicum , nux vomica , mustard , fennel , and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments .	1073.1412
flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons .	660.57184
peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection .	3090.868
still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible .	11648.317
the common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group .	1810.4476
each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported .	1110.4889
single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica .	1251.4357
less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom .	4661.68
white pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit .	811.5276
sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in egypt , brazil , and central america , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds .	1058.8645
it is a main flavoring for halvah , the candy of the middle east .	714.628
sesame sticks , a snack dip , originated in the southwest .	1464.0613
beverages are made from seeds the world over .	1357.3251
coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree .	601.96014
world production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons .	678.0214
per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the united states .	90.43346
cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree .	1222.9762
world production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between africa ( 63 percent ) and south america ( 27 percent ) .	779.95557
several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts , the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the west indies and south america .	1837.863

the japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain .	6096.362
arrack is distilled from fermented rice in india .	2028.5238
beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage .	3410.9578

brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley .	1283.7238
distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol .	5564.1143
seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the united states .	99.22482
the farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year .	267.89633
cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised .	748.19446
the economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater , because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn , oats , barley , and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed , cottonseed , and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry , meat , and dairy products .	823.9214
seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock .	342.70084
hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed .	675.96155
seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed .	3640.0537
more than 11 thousand business establishments in the united states were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 .	485.55692
the value of products from these industries was 15 . 8 billion dollars , of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes .	482.43372
not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products .	1148.2352
cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the american diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry .	856.6442
to hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin ' ' ' ' em .	326.35907
to keep ' em scattered somewhat and yet herd ' em was called `` loose herdin ' ' ' .	569.9989
to hold ' em in a compact mass was `` close herdin ' ' ' .	245.59142
cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted .	296.65244
that became their `` home range ' ' .	29.204
yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin ' grass and water .	1378.327
these became `` strays ' ' , the term bein ' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses ' ' , not merely `` strays ' ' .	250.26671
cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over .	662.80225
you had to go with ' em or wait till the storm was over , and follow .	444.95615
such marchin ' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift ' ' , or `` winter drift ' ' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range .	212.78604
the cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals .	394.9864
the single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays ' '	390.15076
but when a large number were `` bunched up ' ' or `` banded up ' ' , and marched away from their home range , as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a `` drift ' ' .	298.9409
drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede .	523.3603
drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had ' nough sense to avoid ' em , and to find shelter for ' emselves .	570.75525
the wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards , and sometimes droughts , over a wide range of territory was called a `` die-up ' ' .	606.43066
followin ' such an event there was usually a harvest of `` fallen hides ' ' , and the ranchers needed skinnin ' knives instead of brandin ' irons .	1954.1594
cattle were said to be `` potted ' ' when `` blizzard choked ' ' , that is , caught in a corner or a draw , or against a `` drift fence ' ' durin ' a storm .	281.6427
cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill ' ' .	249.57706
when cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up ' ' .	749.4817
this term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin ' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` he arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm ' ' .	476.86615
cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature ' em into prime beef were said to be `` double wintered ' ' .	693.20416
cattle brought into a range from a distance were called `` immigrants ' ' .	268.30206
them new to the country were referred to as `` pilgrims ' ' .	131.70282
this word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot .	1248.2799
hereford cattle were often called `` white faces ' ' , or `` open-face cattle ' ' , and the old-time cowman gave the name of `` hothouse stock ' ' to them newly introduced cattle .	290.69318
because holstein cattle weren ' t a beef breed , they were rarely seen on a ranch , though one might be found now and then for the milk supply .	209.84023
the cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies ' ' .	488.19403
a `` cattaloe ' ' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle .	843.4919
`` dry stock ' ' denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin ' no milk .	509.09784
a `` wet herd ' ' was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows , while `` wet stuff ' ' referred to cows givin ' milk .	328.2184
the cowboy ' s humorous name for a cow givin ' milk was a `` milk pitcher ' ' .	383.5502
cows givin ' no milk were knowed as `` strippers ' ' .	929.0103
the terminology of the range , in speakin ' of `` dry stock ' ' and `` wet stock ' ' , was confusin ' to the tenderfoot .	287.1542
the most common reference to `` wet stock ' ' was with the meanin ' that such animals had been smuggled across the rio grande after bein ' stolen from their rightful owners .	1190.0685
the term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals .	716.4794
`` mixed herd ' ' meant a herd of mixed sexes , while a `` straight steer herd ' ' was one composed entirely of steers , and when the cowman spoke of `` mixed cattle ' ' , he meant cattle of various grades , ages , and sexes .	446.83783
in the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass , this was spoken of as `` turn-out time ' ' , or `` put to grass ' ' .	390.63382
`` shootin ' ' em out ' ' was gettin ' cattle out of a corral onto the range .	521.5895
when a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin ' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin ' ' ' .	461.35052
to stir cattle up and get ' em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle ' ' , and the act was called `` ginnin ' ' em ' round ' ' , or `` chousin ' ' em ' ' .	345.70715
after a roundup the pushin ' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called `` throwin ' over ' ' .	1177.9707
a cow rose from the ground rear end first .	2590.8857
by the time her hindquarters were in a standin ' position , her knees were on the ground in a prayin ' attitude .	795.89954
it was when she was in this position that the name `` prayin ' cow ' ' was suggested to the cowboy .	226.61954
they were said to be `` on their heads ' ' when grazin ' .	366.31354
`` on the hoof ' ' was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin ' to cattle travelin ' by trail under their own power as against goin ' by rail .	1275.2062
shippin ' cattle by train was called a `` stock run ' ' .	128.84863
a general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers ' ' .	1103.5206
when a cowboy spoke of `` dustin ' ' ' a cow , he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes .	514.487
the cow , unlike a bull or steer , kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin ' , and a cow `` on the prod ' ' or `` on the peck ' ' was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges .	455.40396
the injun ' s name for beef was `` wohaw ' ' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the injun on the trails .	381.82907
the first cattle the injuns saw under the white man ' s control were the ox teams of the early freighters .	1113.5623
listenin ' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted `` whoa ' ' , `` haw ' ' , and `` gee ' ' , they thought them words the names of the animals , and began callin ' cattle `` wohaws ' ' .	408.03152
rarely did a trail herd pass through the injun country on its march north that it wasn ' t stopped to receive demand for `` wohaw ' ' .	421.7047
`` tailin ' ' ' was the throwin ' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope .	227.03975
any animal could when travelin ' fast , be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin ' the brute , seizin ' its tail , and givin ' the latter a pull to one side .	1510.7538
this throwed the animal off balance , and over it ' d crash onto its head and shoulders .	629.84344
though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin ' results , many men assured success through a turn of the tail ' bout the saddle horn , supplemented sometimes , in the case of cattle , by a downward heave of the rider ' s leg upon the strainin ' tail .	1150.5688
such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough `` tailin ' ' ' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed ' im that he ' d behave for the rest of the day .	425.79434
it required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin ' rider .	1809.6932
when cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was ' round .	799.36176
when the cowboy used the word `` tailin ' s ' ' , he meant stragglers .	211.19215
`` bull tailin ' ' ' was a game once pop ' lar with the mexican cowboys of texas .	762.2269
from a pen of wild bulls one would be released , and with much yellin ' a cowhand ' d take after ' im .	1753.1544
seizin ' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin ' the bull off balance , and `` bustin ' ' ' ' im with terrific force .	578.69574
rammin ' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold ' im down was called `` peggin ' ' ' .	399.022
colors of cattle came in for their special names .	220.0506
an animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a `` brindle ' ' or `` brockle ' ' .	494.69308
a `` lineback ' ' was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin ' down its back , while a `` lobo stripe ' ' was the white , yeller , or brown stripe runnin ' down the back , from neck to tail , a characteristic of many spanish cattle .	527.15155
a `` mealynose ' ' was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter ' n the rest of its body ' round the eyes , face , and nose .	323.12308
such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed ' ' .	108.99742
`` sabinas ' ' was a spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin ' .	3993.1262
the northern cowboy called all the red mexican cattle which went up the trail `` sonora reds ' ' , while they called all cattle drove up from mexico `` yaks ' ' , because they came from the yaqui injun country , or gave ' em the name of `` mexican buckskins ' ' .	532.3595
near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin ' on the sides and belly , were called `` zorrillas ' ' .	1308.3322
this word was from the spanish , meanin ' `` polecat ' ' .	587.66034
`` yeller bellies ' ' were cattle of mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color .	8643.73
an animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a `` marker ' ' .	549.17926
such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler .	473.7934
countin ' each grazin ' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin ' it back so that it didn ' t mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count ' ' .	314.022
the countin ' of cattle in a pasture without throwin ' ' em together for the purpose was called a `` pasture count ' ' .	309.7686
the counters rode through the pasture countin ' each bunch of grazin ' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn ' t get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead .	2340.6658
this method of countin ' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd .	155.31836
them notes and mortgages were spoken of as `` cattle paper ' ' .	141.38115
a `` book count ' ' was the sellin ' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller .	312.95172
this led to the famous sayin ' in the northwest of the `` books won ' t freeze ' ' .	150.39241
this became a common byword durin ' the boom days when eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests .	2373.6301
the origin of this sayin ' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of luke murrin .	1634.7128
his saloon was a meetin ' place for influential wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin ' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin ' long faces , he said , `` cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won ' t freeze ' ' .	1777.7355
in this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin ' custom of buyin ' by book count , and created a sayin ' which has survived through the years .	911.2766
`` range delivery ' ' meant that the buyer , after examinin ' the seller ' s ranch records and considerin ' his rep ' tation for truthfulness , paid for what the seller claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it .	1018.80524
when a cowhand said that a man had `` good cow sense ' ' , he meant to pay ' im a high compliment .	188.47656
no matter by what name cattle were called , there was no denyin ' that they not only saved texas from financial ruin , but went far toward redeemin ' from a wilderness vast territories of the northwest .	2145.2769
the first use of the word `` rustler ' ' was as a synonym for `` hustler ' ' , becomin ' an established term for any person who was active , pushin ' , and bustlin ' in any enterprise .	505.7752
again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler , and when the order was given to go out and `` rustle the hosses ' ' , it meant for ' im to go out and herd ' em in .	341.61438
eventually herdin ' the hosses was spoken of as `` hoss rustlin ' ' ' , and the wrangler was called the `` hoss rustler ' ' .	269.5912
later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief , startin ' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to `` get out and rustle a few mavericks ' ' .	1309.5706
it was john who found the lion tracks .	488.0455
he found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and jones knew it was a hot trail .	612.6918
he stifled the comanche yell and let john lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain .	3575.9185
this mountain was known as the black reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass .	2555.908
on the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly .	1723.664
kearton and ulyate had started the day together while jones followed the dogs , and means and loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the reef and pointed .	448.5142
`` that ' s the colonel ' ' , he said , `` but i can ' t see the dogs ' ' .	43.378315
as they watched , jones rode straight for the reef .	773.5314
then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him .	496.49072
the dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ?	797.43616
the pack had made a bend to the north , swinging back toward the reef , and kearton and ulyate could hear them faintly .	859.4104
kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring loveless and means and the rest of the party .	621.81433
`` not yet ' ' , cautioned ulyate .	315.67358
jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern toe of the reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , old john with his grand canyon voice outstanding above the others .	638.6507
there was sounder , too , also a veteran of the north rim , and rastus and the rake from a pack of english fox-hounds , and a collie from a london pound , and simba , a terrier .	969.7113
a motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty .	415.99017
jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on .	3308.49
ulyate said , and kearton touched a match to the pile of grass , blew on it and flame licked out .	2336.758
he threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose .	335.07565
`` that will fetch the gang and tell the colonel where we are ' ' .	156.74484
then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying .	7711.942
then the heavy roar of a lion .	103.30441
kearton and ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound .	518.2547
it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away .	473.161
at the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot .	915.61444
the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when kearton lost sight of ulyate and called , ulyate answered from ten feet away .	2730.2656
nice country to meet a lion in face to face .	389.25638
ulyate and kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the crest , and peering through the branches of a bush , this is what ulyate saw jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside , sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness , who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs whirled around her .	874.574
ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to lips , almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off , `` the dogs have got her bayed .	1023.607
she ' s just the other side of that bush ' ' ! !	86.14523
and when they had drawn back a step he added `` jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her .	685.07227
why she doesn ' t charge him , i don ' t know .	31.512352
and he hasn ' t even got a knife on him .	256.96005
he couldn ' t get away from her in this kind of ground .	144.78131
careful , don ' t disturb her ' ' .	32.849598
jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the reef .	262.3114
she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared , opening her mouth wide , lashing her tail , and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation , as much as to say `` how dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct ' ' ? ?	922.5387
intuition told him , however , that she was tired and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge , yet .	311.4731
he moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less predictable than the male .	569.5425
( in the graveyard at nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso .	2371.9094
of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses .	1058.8337
) she snarled terribly but intuition told him , again , that she was bluffing , and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs .	475.9318
it was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock .	272.64603
even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her .	336.9787
but john nipped her rear end -- one lion ' s rear end was as good as another to john , africa , arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at john , but he ducked back .	588.60016
jones then recoiled his rope and threw again , this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her .	1315.7709
she whirled and faced him , roaring terribly , and ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him , because he wouldn ' t have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace uncertain	374.50507
while jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer .	640.9654
from the lioness ' point of view , this strange creature on the back of another creature , lashing out with its long thin paw , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with .	1222.694
but now she sank lower to the rock .	392.6728
her roar changed to a growl .	643.79175
although she appeared more subdued and defeated , jones knew she was growing more dangerous .	1380.0219
she was rested and could mount a charge .	619.098
just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet .	1562.9392
at this moment , loveless and means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks .	955.5709
the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded old john .	1222.8088
`` we ' ve got to get her out of there ' ' ! !	68.46187
jones yelled , `` or she ' ll kill ' em all .	540.109
for such an emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of their equipment .	2342.347
lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed .	1298.7252
`` ain ' t she a beauty , though ' ' ? ?	93.81736
called out means as she ran .	258.9311
`` don ' t you go a step nearer her than i do ' ' , jones warned , `` and if you do , go at a run so you ' ll have momentum ' ' ! !	238.51427
for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the reef , trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw .	384.97888
but she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away .	356.9652
it was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again .	1718.1251
and the sun was beginning to go down .	177.42065
if dark came they would lose her .	196.31448
`` i ' ll get a pole ' ' , jones said finally , `` and i ' ll poke a noose over her head ' ' ! !	167.56865
at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the reef .	1808.4916
ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions ' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason .	534.1182
`` it won ' t work , colonel ' ' .	50.476604
`` just the same we ' ll try it ' ' .	32.737713
but without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain .	503.68518
john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood .	828.19867
john himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning .	353.25928
she took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up .	513.53357
she had chosen the spot well .	775.3785
with the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land .	219.6098
`` careful , now ' ' , jones warned .	144.3467
very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion .	2273.3213
they tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion , but these didn ' t .	230.47197
again she snarled , and again he edged .	841.8842
the pony was sidewise to her .	111.817375
with a whirling jump , it could get into gear .	193.32622
however nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a cheetah .	1105.5588
for thirty yards she gained rapidly .	1038.5784
she was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here jones and loveless and ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound .	622.78284
means held steady one jump ahead of her .	605.8985
then gradually he began to pull away .	277.48392
a western cowpony had outrun an african lion , from a standing start .	932.8651
photos showed later that she ' d been about six feet from means .	233.61464
of course the factor of head start made all the difference .	178.62418
the lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn ' t catch means , and made for jones .	200.56375
as she had done with means , she gained rapidly at first , but then baldy began to draw away .	681.4243
somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point .	752.86694
when jones too drew away , she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully , crouched low and waited as before .	781.3626
this new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance .	546.35913
there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went .	653.28705
so means edged around on the north side of her , jones moved in from the south .	163.31451
tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .	1072.2001
he succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back .	605.655
from behind her means shot forward at a run .	450.78693
kearton began shouting , `` wait , wait -- the camera ' s jammed ' ' ! !	305.52252
he raced by within twenty feet of her , roped her around the neck , but a lioness ' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off .	872.54956
the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies .	939.0862
but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life .	413.7364
the christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .	506.50238
the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .	373.9501
most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .	385.25525
they may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical rover boys ' ' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so .	567.3023
as long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt .	766.68024
the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .	599.68854
progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference ' ' of the national council or the world council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors .	385.19794
the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .	2045.3855
until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality .	411.18372
as things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main street in the nation .	929.2287
the crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community .	631.14764
the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members .	245.33568
it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .	347.15222
it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .	511.71295
it has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots ' ' .	463.86234
this way of describing the matter is unfortunate .	156.95966
one is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top ' ' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels ' ' .	201.27856
the truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world .	228.54161
the other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .	608.2244
however needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ in the world .	166.6039
the basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation .	638.90717
it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .	298.2613
most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .	844.27527
the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .	253.47917
the jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the christian congregation , but hinduism , buddhism , islam , confucianism , taoism , shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .	1002.616
their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship .	386.0968
how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia ! !	991.0217
what is now called christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .	795.97845
the koinonia of acts and of the epistles means sharing in a common relation to christ .	1276.362
it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of christ in his people .	252.91968
as dietrich bonhoffer puts it , `` our community with one another consists solely in what christ has done to both of us ' ' .	244.56606
this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all .	281.48642
there is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .	567.92346
whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal church , in vital relation with the whole body of christ and participating in his mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .	359.60645
the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .	764.9066
the local and the ecumenical are one .	617.1171
of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place .	236.68927
each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .	283.92584
neither is adequate if it stands alone .	338.6228
our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .	2832.604
and this is what all too often happens .	1263.9401
a little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor bela vasady at the end of the second world war .	622.29926
with great difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world council of churches .	423.17136
when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .	1093.5632
he often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical ' ' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church .	238.5974
it is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both .	992.4522
as things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other .	243.5415
on the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town .	288.93454
they do not escape the pitfall into which charles dickens pictured mrs . jellyby as falling .	4208.911
her concern for the natives of borrioboola-gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son peepy ! !	3041.2888
likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in east germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary china , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .	654.90326
on the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission .	390.4664
as a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families .	268.93866
it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members .	339.34467
the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .	201.30708
the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .	1001.99
it is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .	328.15033
its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .	1324.9689
it provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .	398.69525
it helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible .	566.4457
it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation .	646.01013
and it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .	666.65717
but what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians in the world ? ?	648.39105
all too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind .	638.4619
it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of christ .	252.00537
it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .	278.91232
it is not making them sensitive to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .	621.4713
it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples .	879.5197
it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in asia and africa .	714.3029
to put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want .	1022.1658
it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility in relation to the world .	218.56479
we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness and mission to the world .	448.6299
there is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community .	541.0676
he built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn .	290.84833
desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it .	661.9435
a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` do you belong to this church , mr . rancher ' ' ? ?	171.6624
`` why , no , ma ' am ' ' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me ' ' ! !	88.55257
the story reflects the way too many people feel .	1041.2357
as long as the congregation regards the church as `` our ' ' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my ' ' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .	605.0696
there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to christ , and that it is his purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do .	208.76474
a local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .	517.2558
it would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the church of christ .	167.081
yet the truth , according to the new testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place .	302.82275
yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms	515.947
and buggies and wagons and chugging fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap .	1133.5004
this was a bitterly fought game , carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight , with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd .	1151.4569
every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision .	4150.4565
at one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys , he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead ' ' or the base runners were free to score .	987.20374
this was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship .	536.5732
when the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly , `` you bunch of hay-shakers ! !	1145.2355
baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business .	315.86786
radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the cubs or the pirates or the indians or the red sox .	557.0745
young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major leagues .	565.91895
nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the three i league , or the pony league , or the coastal plains league , or the fast eastern league , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere .	808.13635
even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over .	660.7792
babe ruth , of course , was everyone ' s hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball .	402.40805
his face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life .	655.2044
as the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by babe ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account .	841.66547
boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up ' ' on a bat as willie keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done .	1276.1917
other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching ruth , who was still called jidge by all his friends , or leo or two-head by those who dared to taunt him ( leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` kid ' ' .	634.7985
lou gehrig was given the nickname buster , and he ran ruth a close race in home runs .	764.0231
but the nickname never stuck and gehrig was no match for ruth in `` color ' ' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field .	626.4319
ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it .	473.9308
a few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with daddy browning ' s , al capone ' s , earl sande ' s , and the prince of wales ' .	688.0859
one who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was charles arthur shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , art the great , or the great shires .	418.36972
it was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists .	304.6757
he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond	2687.7239
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in art ' s pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first baseman for some forgotten reason .	751.66455
( this made a sportswriter named pegler wonder in print if art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager .	10383.274
) the sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public .	556.80475
in his minor way charles arthur shires was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these scott fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers .	759.7931
there were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down	3058.8726
or who ingested strange objects , like live fish	1917.954
or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner	856.1227
or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .	5692.968
one young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the yale-army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once .	908.3123
but the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition .	1133.7922
the business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to george herman ruth ' s spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too .	1237.0436
while fifty years before , albert goodwill spalding , secretary of the chicago ball club of the national league , could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in august , in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate .	517.9397
and while less than ten years earlier the wayward black sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy charles comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season .	1494.5641
the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new york yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named ed barrow and miller huggins .	2009.6046
boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the red sox -- sold to millionaires huston and ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire .	1238.2982
ruth himself , still owning his farm in massachusetts and an interest in the massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from fenway park , followed by pitchers carl mays , leslie `` joe ' ' bush , waite hoyt , herb pennock , and sam jones , catcher wally schang , third baseman joe dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio ' ' of ruth , dugan , and hoyt ) , and shortstop everett scott .	1878.7278
by 1926 , when the mighty yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like tony lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , mark koenig , lou gehrig , george pipgras , and gray-thatched earl combs .	2755.7605
the deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two world ' s series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said .	291.93448
but there is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one world ' s series game in 1926 like best to recall .	584.80743
babe ruth , as he always did in the stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and tommy thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st . louis cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where ruth could not reach it .	637.75085
the ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` where ' s the -- -ing ball ' ' ? ?	622.5314
but , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me ' ' , so little tommy ran all the way home .	464.7025
the ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those golden days , or of any other sporting event for that matter .	329.12143
promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .	329.14246
radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers ' ' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .	990.28766
in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .	1656.6683
this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .	848.53937
while women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport ' ' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one .	556.6497
the questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers	2544.5454
for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male american in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists .	842.90967
and women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball .	441.4282
radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` ladies ' days ' ' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home .	472.31927
women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears .	1961.4298
the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .	1019.0855
this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal ' ' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .	1167.7753
our discussion of this involves using erik erikson ' s schema of `` identity vs . identity diffusion ' ' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .	2836.3574
our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers .	1914.7684
we hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .	729.135
hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual ' s infancy and end in his old age , erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises .	372.34674
the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual ' s positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .	926.4237
within erikson ' s schema , the adolescent ' s delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion ' ' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively .	914.3129
the adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs . time diffusion .	618.1096
time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives .	452.73514
erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .	997.4037
experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately .	1074.9666
these polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .	752.1439
some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .	454.2129
others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .	228.98625
for many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general .	422.4536
however , as erickson has noted , the individual ' s failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .	938.7898
and , as shown in chapter 6 , , some snp females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .	914.7168
in the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .	362.21906
the adolescent experiences two closely related crises self-certainty vs . an identity consciousness	3697.5352
a sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one ' s own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy .	633.7859
however , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups	1513.7109
inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards	655.3665
and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded .	729.29285
her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .	878.4036
to be different is to invite shame and doubt	1767.9336
and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one ' s parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one ' s peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status .	491.08167
the attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .	1545.8195
many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others	1298.773
but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one ' s self .	389.4021
another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs . work-paralysis .	1395.9149
the adolescent ' s capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood .	906.60913
the developmental process involves the individual ' s progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one ' s own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be ' ' ) .	450.4337
these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .	446.11313
if she has not had such experiences , the female ' s normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded .	376.71414
she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e . g . , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker	316.02332
whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school	1887.5923
whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school	792.72894
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .	287.62836
erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship ' ' .	216.72107
this paralysis may be expressed in the female ' s starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study	399.49814
and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes .	515.44293
the absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .	777.2949
the comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .	2528.2854
they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made	1704.0004
they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .	563.25964
these things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .	290.89938
as their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs .	1088.026
these affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done .	709.79504
childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy .	837.9736
the excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .	1329.9003
for example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence	1351.7781
they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .	2267.2603
on the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .	808.3186
the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs . diffusion of ideals .	2229.7969
in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose erikson ' s concept on our data .	1496.9221
adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or ' ' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant .	1016.8498
this tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .	1023.88184
erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man ' s-land between childhood and adulthood .	3894.7117
it provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .	618.7091
the positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty .	475.2424
most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .	819.0063
the diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .	385.53348
a pronounced ideological diffusion -- i . e . , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .	241.98952
for example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice .	628.5111
it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .	736.96124
in another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers ' ' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs .	225.60573
the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother ' s inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .	837.1229
for example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly ' ' .	452.51694
they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .	2477.383
they condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .	9088.283
they criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong	4063.834
and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive ' ' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant ' ' .	395.35535
in the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent ' s search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .	493.53033
for example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys ' ' and the `` bad guys ' ' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences .	637.608
in the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .	3020.469
an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive .	1124.1143
yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure .	965.6872
the duration and other circumstances of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions .	780.447
the suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the american patent system .	768.0194
chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .	5540.16
in a long and angry footnote to his opinion , judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism .	1500.9254
`` it is a duty ' ' , said hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the supreme court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation .	527.29456
as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , i fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of equity ' ' .	2718.0693
observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples ' ' , hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures .	1358.981
he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case record	1303.6833
the duplication of testimony and exhibits	577.0661
the numerous squabbles over minor matters	10489.33
the `` objections stated at outrageous length ' '	1439.1112
and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , `` uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct ' ' .	5829.729
the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example ' ' , concluded hough , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony ' ' .	484.1129
not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the selden suit .	737.60596
william a . redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years .	371.53412
inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the selden litigation as a `` horrible example ' ' .	407.0232
its costive deliberations were likened to those of the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in bleak house .	5052.8613
parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects .	564.9882
but he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried .	2540.817
in a detailed letter published in the scientific american in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements ' ' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts .	365.25812
the suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases .	1660.2649
parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony .	739.73553
in a private communication written in 1911 , parker had been more to the point .	184.45796
noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded ' ' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent .	547.7362
the vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance ' ' for or against the patent , said parker .	435.79556
`` this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur ' ' .	239.68013
parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony .	567.9327
the most important of these found him in agreement with hough ' s plea for reform .	604.609
parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony .	593.7367
the taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony .	1396.9257
`` i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that ' ' .	623.8927
in the end hough ' s acidulous protest , which parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' selden ' case ' ' , did not go unheeded .	903.9121
in 1912 the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on february 1 , 1913 .	458.1348
the revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform .	4729.242
under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character .	976.5292
other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits .	1402.7556
one of the a . l . a . m . lawyers observed that if the selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume ' ' .	254.34813
while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money .	1570.2382
there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme court as a direct result of the selden patent suit .	383.45108
even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the a . l . a . m . was succeeded by the automobile board of trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturers association .	396.29926
the trade bodies which came in the wake of the a . l . a . m . were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion .	247.58525
nevertheless , it is from the selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .	845.3485
one of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of american industrial cooperation .	444.603
its origin lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath .	1318.0334
from the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the a . l . a . m . was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem .	317.75406
many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .	2801.9219
the fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims .	999.8084
as early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers .	2562.4963
this scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 .	1158.1931
in this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the a . l . a . m . at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation .	609.619
the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the a . l . a . m . patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology .	714.8962
one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among a . l . a . m . members .	219.3674
within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement .	616.90735
its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly .	480.01126
since the a . l . a . m . holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry .	845.6081
the highly important dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the a . l . a . m . pool .	298.39816
but henry ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor .	495.56427
for those affiliated with it , the a . l . a . m . pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 .	496.5554
by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions .	2333.1094
it was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail .	1641.7871
`` purely from the business man ' s standpoint and without regard to the lawyer ' s view ' ' , commented a trade journal , `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation ' ' .	579.9438
occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .	1171.988
one manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said `` i would readily put over $50 , 000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits ' ' .	395.6369
the prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee `` the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste ' ' .	874.36176
by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information .	2282.1003
at this point charles c . hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the national automobile chamber of commerce , successor to the automobile board of trade .	357.93283
hanch was treasurer of the nordyke & marmon company , an indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the marmon car in 1904 .	7481.06
he had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890 ' s .	316.46033
anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , hanch went to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading a . l . a . m . members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan .	853.9374
the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal , but hanch did not abandon his scheme .	1180.1245
after the demise of the a . l . a . m . , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool .	123.466805
most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .	616.9053
`` it is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned ' ' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day ' ' .	412.4216
with the other members of the patents committee -- wilfred c . leland , howard e . coffin , windsor t . white , and w . h . vandervoort -- hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution .	1780.8909
the plan was supported by frederick p . fish , counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce .	693.809
it will be recalled that in his summation for the a . l . a . m . before judge hough , fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial community .	363.1164
he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value .	1859.2959
`` my personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making ' ' , he later told a congressional committee .	386.8387
the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .	651.16815
drawn up in 1914 , the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 .	721.4992
it remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925 .	750.50775
a little farther along the road you come to the church of santa sabina , called the `` pearl of the aventine ' ' .	338.06073
continue another hundred yards to the piazza of the knights of malta .	243.55914
on the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .	779.77893
the massive gate of the maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in rome .	568.0396
if you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of st . peter ' s framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees .	814.68164
retrace your steps a few yards on the via di santa sabina and turn right on the via di s . alessio , a street lined with stately homes .	1138.422
oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section .	990.5015
turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the via di santa prisca to the viale aventino .	1676.4955
here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city .	215.07237
these two walks take you through the heart of rome .	248.27437
you will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi .	1431.4282
you will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the spanish steps , and the lovely pincian gardens .	936.21
by seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of renaissance rome .	667.4791
you will realize why rome is indeed the eternal city .	713.569
start on the via d . teatro di marcello at the foot of the capitoline hill .	1039.4022
the majestic circular tiers of stone of the theatre of marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the emperor augustus erected in 13 b . c . .	731.3901
twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in roman days .	1775.5625
andrea palladio , an italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its doric and ionic columns .	1180.3738
wander past the three superb columns of apollo by the arches of the theatre .	484.67142
the remains of the portico of octavia are now in front of you .	1308.8969
climb the steps from the theatre to the via della tribuna di campitelli for an even better view of the columns of apollo .	904.12726
turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny piazza campitelli , then proceed along the via dei funari to the piazza mattei .	2291.3271
here is one of the loveliest fountains in rome , the fontana delle tartarughe or `` fountain of the tortoises ' ' .	1202.6885
it ' s typical of rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square .	242.69153
stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin .	736.76697
the figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement .	795.5729
opposite is the palazzo mattei , one of rome ' s oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the italo-american association .	499.42484
go inside for a closer look at a renaissance palace .	912.9555
in the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall .	1161.0807
the palazzo caetani , still inhabited by the caetani family , adjoins the palazzo mattei .	5588.1665
keep straight ahead on the via falegnami , cross the wide via arenula , and you will come to the piazza b . cairoli , where you should look in at the church of san carlo ai catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling .	921.3438
follow the colorful and busy via d . giubbonari for a hundred yards or so .	1018.28015
now turn left at the via dell ' arco del monte to the piazza dei pellegrini .	6393.4727
just a few yards to the right on the via capo di ferro will bring you to the palazzo spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the council of state .	683.90967
paintings by titian , caravaggio , and rubens are on display ( open 9 30 to 4 00 ) .	1560.551
before you enter the palazzo , note francesco borromini ' s facade .	2371.0623
the great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts .	2672.8196
the large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of pompey at the base of which julius caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) .	487.51337
( this is shown in the afternoon and on sunday morning .	172.99515
by tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard borromini ' s unusual and fascinating trick in perspective .	454.14294
when you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away .	430.02863
the sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front .	360.06784
the gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive .	2783.295
from the palazzo spada you continue another block along the via capo di ferro and vicolo de venti to the imposing palazzo farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all .	1503.8812
michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it .	1317.0822
today it is occupied by the french embassy .	227.43297
its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen sundays ( 11 00 to 12 00 noon ) .	1145.5221
ask to see the modern tapestries of paris and rome designed by lurcat .	2805.0017
directly in front of the palace along the via d . baullari you will come to the campo di fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of renaissance rome .	855.4351
today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market .	551.7
continue on the via d . baullari to the corso vittorio emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the church of sant ' andrea della valle .	1329.2808
as you approach the church on the via d . baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the roman theatre of pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where julius caesar was assassinated .	669.58307
the dome of the church is , outside of st . peter ' s , one of the largest in rome .	129.4693
opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of tosca .	415.45316
at this point you cross the wide corso vittorio emanuele 2 , , walk along the corso del rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the via dei canestrani to enter the splendid piazza navona , one of the truly glorious sights in rome .	1483.821
your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk .	1309.114
the site of the oblong piazza is domitian ' s ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races .	2098.4573
for centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events .	3991.489
from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages .	423.52664
giovanni bernini ' s `` fountain of the rivers ' ' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a roman obelisk from the circus of maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the danube , the ganges , the nile , and the plate .	581.6623
the eyes of the figure of the nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the church of sant ' agnese in agone , the work of bernini ' s rival , borromini .	714.56525
in the piazza navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square .	352.56934
the scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about rome .	2946.822
perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch .	408.35913
take the via di s . agnese in agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful church of santa maria della pace .	542.00574
inside you will find the lovely sibyls painted by raphael and a chapel designed by michelangelo .	3844.8538
the church ' s cloisters are among donato bramante ' s most beautiful creations .	4662.0625
now return to the piazza navona and leave it on the opposite side by the corsia agonale	4193.3857
in a moment cross the corso del rinascimento .	437.31287
in front of you is the palazzo madama , once belonging to the medici and now the italian senate .	1780.4663
walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the via giustiniani you will come to the piazza della rotonda .	1062.8092
you are now facing the pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient rome .	1423.4088
this circular edifice , constructed by agrippa in b . c . 27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the emperor hadrian .	1494.5563
it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century .	144.70663
as you pause in the piazza by the egyptian obelisk brought from the temple of isis , you will admire the pantheon ' s impressive corinthian columns .	710.1593
the pantheon ' s interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph .	613.3749
its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling .	404.68115
the only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .	2532.4697
standing before the tomb of raphael , the great genius of the renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of rome .	664.62006
as you leave the pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the via del seminario , a block to sant ' ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city .	439.61984
( along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , la sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in rome .	393.42905
) the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set .	1193.1129
this is one of the most charming little squares in this part of rome .	233.82616
one block along the via de burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the stock exchange in the old temple of neptune .	450.74005
a few yards farther , on the via dei bergamaschi , is the piazza colonna .	1103.8754
the great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor marcus aurelius .	2815.3545
you are now at the corso , though narrow , one of rome ' s busiest streets .	490.38342
horse races took place here in the middle ages .	177.79346
if you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the palazzo doria ( open sunday , tuesday , and thursday , 10 00 to 1 00 ) .	541.03046
here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives .	191.96915
otherwise , cross over the corso and walk a block or so to the left .	292.58276
you will come to alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries .	2632.635
either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of rome .	265.5184
the second walk through the heart of rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the pincian hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best .	317.84592
rare , indeed , is the harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality .	677.2934
i myself have witnessed and endured it more than once .	493.63812
the businessmen and racketeers also have a story .	306.0279
( and this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss harlem ' s very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to harlem , that they are nearly all downtown .	346.62308
it is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves .	613.3737
he , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed .	692.78784
he has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ?	274.19827
-- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it .	531.2062
there is no way for him not to know it there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people .	661.1183
he moves through harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country	685.5108
which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes .	472.8644
and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company the people who are watching him know why , too .	378.7751
any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination .	1255.0051
and these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination .	344.13895
the white policeman standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world .	302.17004
he is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him .	220.19722
even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in .	2113.219
he cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children .	186.41348
he knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .	419.56317
he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature .	1435.2181
he becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased .	414.50275
one day , to everyone ' s astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up .	1308.4457
before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened .	1384.976
what happened is that negroes want to be treated like men .	331.95877
negroes want to be treated like men a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words .	1263.0587
people who have mastered kant , hegel , shakespeare , marx , freud , and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable .	2587.1968
the idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions .	2956.7378
a kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place .	1051.1581
i once tried to describe to a very well-known american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south .	408.39203
my recital disturbed him and made him indignant	1456.8438
and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` why don ' t all the negroes in the south move north ' ' ? ?	137.30307
i tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of negroes move north .	840.6487
they do not escape jim crow they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety .	16478.664
they do not move to chicago , they move to the south side	282.46017
they do not move to new york , they move to harlem .	417.38855
the pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent .	1294.2407
white people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence .	511.13382
but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto .	308.76743
the white people fall back bitterly before the black horde	5438.613
the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep	2060.23
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf ' ' .	222.33511
this is precisely what happened when the puerto ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as i write , being fought out all up and down those streets .	735.2655
northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury .	2006.1991
they seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil war , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the south , without taking any responsibility for it	335.1426
and that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse .	991.2793
well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse ' ' .	155.17392
i know negroes who prefer the south and white southerners , because `` at least there , you haven ' t got to play any guessing games ' ' ! !	201.86229
the guessing games referred to have driven more than one negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river .	970.83
i know another negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` the spirit of the south is the spirit of america ' ' .	131.12775
he was born in the north and did his military training in the south .	177.62152
he did not , as far as i can gather , find the south `` worse ' '	159.25908
he found it , if anything , all too familiar .	455.20312
in the second place , though , even if birmingham is worse , no doubt johannesburg , south africa , beats it by several miles , and buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world .	522.3152
the world has never lacked for horrifying examples	15989.179
but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes .	468.7496
this perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling .	155.85437
the emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes .	297.9277
thirdly , the south is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us .	576.08514
as far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the southern white and the northerner the southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of eden in which he loved black people and they loved him .	548.9924
historically , the flaming sword laid across this eden is the civil war .	422.3414
personally , it is the southerner ' s sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past .	698.6084
everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need .	754.4795
the resulting , indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the basis of the southern hysteria .	1203.6575
none of this is true for the northerner .	401.48343
negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality .	491.80106
southerners see them all the time .	43.675354
northerners never think about them whereas southerners are never really thinking of anything else .	4461.3975
negroes are , therefore , ignored in the north and are under surveillance in the south , and suffer hideously in both places .	660.70917
neither the southerner nor the northerner is able to look on the negro simply as a man .	228.16434
it seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many negroes , comparatively , bought cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) .	581.4737
they are two sides of the same coin and the south will not change -- cannot change -- until the north changes .	288.0349
the country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .	882.9065
in the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us .	1966.802
it is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one ' s own in the face of one ' s victim , one sees oneself .	325.4852
walk through the streets of harlem and see what we , this nation , have become .	359.02222
east river , downtown postscript to a letter from harlem	3687.3406
the fact that american negroes rioted in the u . n . while adlai stevenson was addressing the assembly shocked and baffled most white americans .	1412.4578
stevenson ' s speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in katanga , the day before , of patrice lumumba .	328.66397
stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the united states was `` against ' ' colonialism .	109.53287
god knows what the african nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the u . n . were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the u . s . abstention when the vote on algerian freedom was before the assembly -- but i think i have a fairly accurate notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking .	181.04657
i had intended to be there myself .	231.12248
it was my first reaction upon hearing of lumumba ' s death .	325.55084
i was curious about the impact of this political assassination on negroes in harlem , for lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there .	787.1238
i was curious to know if lumumba ' s death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our ' ' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric .	577.3199
and i was curious about the african reaction .	276.34796
however , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the u . n . gallery .	202.64104
had i been there , i , too , in the eyes of most americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the communists .	135.93536
the climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold ' ' war , have given americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were `` communist ' ' inspired .	350.27045
nor was it long , naturally , before prominent negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the u . n . rioters do not represent the real feeling of the negro community .	273.25632
according , then , to what i take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , stalinist-corrupted provocateurs .	1622.8972
it is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict .	1212.937
one has only , for example , to walk through harlem and ask oneself two questions .	562.055
the first question is would i like to live here ? ?	203.75015
and the second question is why don ' t those who now live here move out ? ?	211.35565
the answer to both questions is immediately obvious .	722.7026
unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that negroes are , somehow , different from white people , i do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the negro ' s status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability .	326.26694
now , i do not doubt that , among the people at the u . n . that day , there were stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .	329.83173
wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found .	357.95996
their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .	882.9638
what i find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the american assumption that the negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest .	697.014
it is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .	733.7385
color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties .	576.6305
movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .	459.50674
each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen .	386.87173
as long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .	467.40106
motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as times square .	513.1027
brief snips of actual events were shown parades , dances , street scenes .	1649.7571
the sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .	992.90094
an early edison production was the execution of mary , queen of scots .	605.1874
the unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold	1172.7808
an early film by a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .	1623.8085
in the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows .	1501.0176
in response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .	309.3134
despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story .	508.4891
moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .	1440.3187
thus such great american documentaries as the river and the plow that broke the plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .	1342.0632
the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a french magician , georges melies , and an american employee of edison , edwin s . porter .	430.25632
of the two , porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands .	730.32294
melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film .	775.10016
one of these is the `` dissolve ' ' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .	648.92706
as the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .	980.2596
for a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .	852.8293
in a series of fairy tales and fantasies , melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions .	1168.4916
immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time .	1135.3792
physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers ' ' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .	396.2883
linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement .	1041.339
the `` projection ' ' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions .	796.35547
so is the time of the novel .	43.210964
the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .	280.85416
the time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .	2028.9581
the film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames ' ' , 35-mm . -wide .	536.35986
each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .	455.1107
this is the rate of projection	1159.9651
it is also the rate of photographing .	703.1613
time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time .	255.95166
now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .	189.97745
the `` moving ' ' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree	284.59232
the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo .	364.13507
in narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .	102.46159
almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .	2120.4685
this discovery of melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician ' s tricks produced on film .	1470.5913
it was porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .	509.93628
the movie was the great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .	1053.1438
overnight , for one thing , porter ' s film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten .	675.0609
the great train robbery is a one-reel film .	1410.7568
one reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of robbery , 1903 , until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of a nation in 1915 .	950.5052
the reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .	469.4202
the material of the porter film is simplicity itself	2846.7104
much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old west -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950 ' s .	302.2447
a band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes .	1472.4277
a posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .	1716.6101
the robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .	767.4564
as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .	878.4845
all this is simple enough , but in telling the story porter did two important things that had not been done before .	1301.7173
each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , porter ' s camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play .	447.0241
the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen .	153.12532
if the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen .	593.9687
in that apparently simple shift porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device .	451.07568
he revealed the potential value of the `` cut ' ' as the basic technique in the art of the film .	101.699326
cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film .	259.0977
the meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .	345.33316
the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .	275.23645
if , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .	1082.8848
if , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child ' s grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film	373.12738
you are employing the basic technique of film	1065.9478
as the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher ' s little daughter arrives with her father ' s dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor .	648.4894
the two events are taking place at the same time .	201.66862
time and space have both become cinematic .	7816.015
we leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in `` reality ' ' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance .	395.5686
the `` chase ' ' as a standard film device probably dates from the great train robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device .	292.7631
the chase in itself is a narrative	483.94098
it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both .	1138.4882
the simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .	506.33746
the cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence	1627.9747
these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .	1742.8373
the creator of the art of the film d . w . griffith	227.35999
there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .	340.43884
when he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .	1044.3689
in about seven years griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker .	1436.01
before he was forty griffith had created the art of the film .	348.4922
not that there had not been attempts , mostly european , to do exactly that .	427.3991
but in general the european efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .	605.1005
staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .	1026.16
great actors and actresses -- the most notable being sarah bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera .	1459.2014
in all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author .	692.19806
the phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .	852.5329
not surprisingly , this approach did not work .	237.27136
the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names .	416.9531
but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .	206.28445
in general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis	290.11893
congregational membership , however , is another thing .	75.69135
a congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership	1366.5155
that is , when it can preserve economic integration .	290.96887
religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining	633.7487
the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .	387.0769
the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches .	1055.901
central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes	403.05325
( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .	403.07767
the central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations they have too few middle-class people	770.7093
they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents .	922.6359
central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities .	1360.6072
with few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .	619.60547
the key to protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation .	118.704765
members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes	1346.1754
but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum .	291.64508
the congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood	520.68665
moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive	637.0758
they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .	729.361
the congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group	2663.2385
it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .	3485.5913
if it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the new protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do .	408.49585
they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .	458.82407
the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit ' ' of protestant religious life	660.8633
in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal ' ' roman catholic parish .	635.837
we have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers	2095.955
consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations	373.24713
actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection .	285.69855
the vulnerability of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration .	288.24567
this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .	90.86069
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .	428.8463
there is much talk in theological circles about the `` church as mission ' ' and the `` church ' s mission ' '	220.6154
theologians have been stressing the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .	128.82646
a crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism .	485.08853
if economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration .	812.70984
the task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .	391.36896
( co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy	582.2728
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .	254.9791
) in a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment	2676.4187
this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation	332.42288
therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated .	586.4497
evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches	416.5662
one study in pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .	132.35442
in a sample of new members of pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members ' ' .	566.3725
if we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church ' ' ( 11 . 2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .	279.39114
on the surface , this seems a sound approach to christian mission members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people	610.3546
the new people respond in kind by joining the church .	415.77994
missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods	1642.4778
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position	670.15326
association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .	516.63074
this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation	510.93472
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation	1142.268
the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation .	551.0115
churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration	556.3798
once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going .	1872.1584
the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .	585.2197
the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17 . 3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .	1013.55945
publicity accounted for 1 . 1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .	119.813774
in general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church	583.49634
economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .	879.217
the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together	3419.9543
the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership .	378.21198
economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation .	395.74652
in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation .	1088.2787
the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .	402.90012
the expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society	797.8838
nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the protestant development .	569.86035
it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .	1945.893
these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .	493.43762
residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .	29443.314
the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized	4212.895
the schism between central city and suburb , negro and white , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .	773.12683
it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .	804.32733
the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .	1234.5962
this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .	2121.472
more than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples .	799.7922
since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .	1048.0581
consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests .	102.743004
negroes , puerto ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .	499.9445
soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .	456.63382
the identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .	555.6208
mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion .	1178.7062
this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .	407.356
it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .	756.4221
it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .	4016.121
whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .	323.9687
attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches	355.88327
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .	364.57602
the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .	5677.072
these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .	624.4603
`` fellowship by likeness ' ' and `` mission by friendly contact ' ' form the iron cage of denominational religion .	399.72125
its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .	863.2127
what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church .	741.4691
an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .	1260.3141
the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need .	479.6234
with capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue .	318.09894
the directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company .	353.09442
these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .	734.03033
the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to france in company ships .	569.7353
the company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show .	233.98431
in accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians .	585.8244
the lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men .	370.91528
traders from the english colonies were far more generous , and indian loyalty turned to them .	1008.0744
protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company .	2400.4062
in 1721 the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .	360.81876
they ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75 , 000 livres with which to build forts .	680.7634
they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts .	803.15643
in each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses .	364.91638
for southeastern louisiana , mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by british traders .	303.05255
mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the tennessee river .	418.5962
fort toulouse , on the alabama river , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas and choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present nashville , tennessee , and this was soon abandoned .	789.3714
west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district , of which new orleans was headquarters .	398.19843
dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of new spain .	705.865
on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas .	231.92986
it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the arkansas river .	662.965
on the ohio or wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers ' ' .	357.17532
other posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication with canada .	948.95056
on the upper mississippi the illinois post was to be established near kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the missouri , `` where there are mines in abundance ' ' .	287.87302
each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at new orleans .	717.2105
an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way .	204.64117
concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors .	181.5072
engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended .	245.267
the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires .	288.53305
only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at mobile , the other at new orleans .	490.84314
new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi , and west of that river , and on the ohio and wabash .	197.50563
mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district .	368.5662
the power that bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .	448.37073
regulations for the indian trade were made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane , and bienville apparently did not have control of that body .	589.6806
the conseil even treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade ' ' .	811.1531
it decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen carolinians .	1012.45856
during the first administration of bienville , the peltry trade of the mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue .	610.41595
the alabamas brought in annually 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 deerskins , and the choctaws and chickasaws brought the total up to 50 , 000 pelts .	589.4346
these deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods .	753.461
during his first administration , bienville succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country .	915.60657
the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the indian needs .	440.80478
the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply .	1698.0768
de la laude , commander of the alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the british as poor competitors .	264.91678
diron d ' artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors .	556.1255
he became , after a time , commander of a post on the alabama river , but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade .	297.0465
the chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district .	281.33963
their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the alabama , the tombigbee , the tennessee , and cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees .	713.7105
in 1720 some chickasaws massacred the french traders among them , and did not make peace for four years .	388.08414
venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the french markets .	195.93929
british traders from south carolina incited the indians against the french , and there developed french and british factions in the tribe .	621.13837
the chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana .	383.53723
to hold them was an essential part of french policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile .	612.87695
they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french settlements near the gulf .	537.86017
bienville realized that if the french were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british goods , french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the carolinians and at reasonable prices .	625.257
the company of the indies promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins .	1755.5972
but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country .	567.48413
the insistence of bienville upon giving liberal prices to the indians , in order to drive back the carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 .	517.6805
for two years his friend and cousin , boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance .	956.4411
although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the carolina advance continued .	698.90765
the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina , and when perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district .	396.78558
but the company of the indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices .	630.1087
to the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .	681.0111
perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the indians .	579.7149
these agents were to ascertain the difference between english and french goods , and the prices charged the indians .	341.1729
they were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina .	991.1314
they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering .	733.89276
the savages divided into two factions	6731.2114
one was british and the other , french .	156.47041
so hostile did these factions become that , among the choctaws , civil war broke out .	551.1429
perier ' s efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country .	258.5676
he asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest english traders and disloyal indians .	635.0716
in spite of the company ' s restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .	146.45248
he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians ' pelts .	471.7046
no help came from the crown , and perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d ' artaguette .	209.32285
d ' artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters .	561.9084
but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon french trade in the region was at an end .	385.94824
perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france .	709.479
the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the mississippi .	350.24203
with the loss of the mobile trade , which ended all profits from louisiana , the natchez indians revolted .	1217.9027
they destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed french shipping on the mississippi .	847.03546
the war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .	586.9919
in january , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony .	138.10783
it stated that it had lost 20 , 000 , 000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade .	600.7335
it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity .	1238.0922
the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1 , 450 , 000 livres .	328.03784
thenceforth , the commerce of louisiana was free to all frenchmen .	563.4213
company rule in louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies .	1262.7275
the difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .	1044.9298
others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the indian trade .	148.86357
if this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois .	453.8721
this was a slow and difficult course , and french trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders .	307.24805
these men were without capital or experience .	460.9978
perier and salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts .	1773.4581
bienville , who returned to succeed perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits .	506.2491
he reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king ' s goods .	639.21893
he did find some to trust , however , and he employed the king ' s soldiers to trade .	144.25394
with no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders .	336.42545
in order to compete with english traders , bienville radically changed the price schedule .	1932.5757
the king should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders .	249.85939
they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury ' s expense .	854.8818
they would be particularly displeased with the state department if it were the source of such reports .	215.54514
few things are more perilous for the state department than a displeased congressman .	762.01465
the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are so available .	818.85046
first , the state department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters .	962.0939
the farmers may be aroused if congress cuts into the agriculture department ' s budget .	707.3704
businessmen will rise if congress attacks the commerce department .	886.8517
labor restrains undue brutality toward the labor department	363.15033
the chamber of commerce , assaults upon the treasury .	695.4459
a kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the department of health , education , and welfare .	377.79022
the congressman ' s patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense department .	468.43478
tampering with the post office may infuriate every voter who can write .	1920.5248
with all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly .	2362.9324
no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the state department in anger .	1159.4934
in many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .	727.67377
after all , the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners .	604.8945
not only do these foreigners not vote for american congressmen	2800.2815
they are also probably ungrateful for uncle ' s sam ' s bounty .	1508.108
and are not the state department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ? ?	3927.861
will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ? ?	983.77106
the chances are excellent that he will .	185.59839
the result is that the state department ' s perpetual position before congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife .	939.5108
people in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers .	1107.7167
state keeps the junketeering list a secret .	553.0974
the department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion .	764.8246
state is expected to arrange the touring cicero ' s foreign itinerary	1335.3148
its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way	422.34323
embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children ' s college tuition .	392.42926
but come the next session of congress , state can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats .	1032.6699
the congressman who , in paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury .	1998.5453
in the matter of money state ' s most unrelenting watchdog during the eisenhower years was representative john j . rooney , of brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses .	864.91846
diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with nikita khrushchev , but with john rooney .	1145.5084
in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps .	6973.1143
`` the trouble , ' ' explained loy henderson , then deputy undersecretary for administration , `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we do ' ' .	481.0123
one year the department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government ' s entertainment bills out of personal income .	604.0376
news of the project reached the press .	289.332
next day , reports went through the department that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar .	900.8373
the department ' s constant fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the senate .	1247.557
armed with constitutional power to negate the executive ' s foreign policy , the senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department ' s back , or on the head of the secretary of state .	249.20651
with its power to investigate , the senate can paralyze the secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with dean acheson .	1118.5391
john foster dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson , who was then operating the senate , refused to let it become an inquisition .	440.39886
during dulles ' s first two years in office , while republicans ran the senate , the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 .	522.6249
an internal police operation managed by scott mcleod , a former f . b . i . man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance .	712.33014
so was the attack upon charles e . bohlen when eisenhower appointed him ambassador to moscow .	2283.9019
the principal mauler , however , was senator joseph mccarthy .	342.6722
where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the department , dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates .	2374.1282
fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way .	2011.7561
in view of eisenhower ' s reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country ' s foreign policy .	434.00964
in any event , the example of acheson ' s trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke it .	867.67413
he elected to `` get along ' ' .	57.514236
during this dark chapter in state department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol hill .	1768.2742
their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent .	559.4053
their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas .	160.56236
this , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats took control .	891.3188
in the new style , the department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the russians .	803.4587
for three or four years in the mid-1950 ' s , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon .	826.29535
it became smart to say that the fault was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself .	862.38324
an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the senate ' s own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation .	1200.6858
there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in washington .	1419.3444
they range from the soviet embassy on sixteenth street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what congressman rooney has called `` that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street ' ' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the belgians .	2720.1038
here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired lothario .	2051.7869
into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies .	1938.9075
here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner .	442.21744
out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington .	4345.1675
some , like the british and the french , maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the american scene .	686.12823
other embassies cable home the new york times without changing a comma .	1542.328
the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage headquarters .	3643.4436
when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over in 1957 from georgi zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea .	453.17557
menshikov hit washington with a tv announcer ' s grin and a hearty handclasp .	2709.596
to everyone ' s astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov .	10896.656
where his predecessors had glowered , menshikov smiled .	12132.634
where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers ' assistants , menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails .	4115.4365
overnight he became the most available man in washington .	307.44327
speeches by the soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club alike .	4484.522
in senator joseph mccarthy ' s phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of .	324.50314
a newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked menshikov `` what should we call you ' ' ? ?	269.31277
and that menshikov replied `` just call me mike ' ' .	458.44006
`` smilin ' mike ' ' was the sobriquet washington gave him .	456.9063
his english was usable and he used it fearlessly .	1013.0197
toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator ' s wife and gaily cried `` up your bottom ' ' ! !	368.1573
for a few giddy months that coincided with one of moscow ' s smiling moods , he was the sensation of washington .	311.97372
at the state department , hard-bitten russian experts complained that the capitol was out of its wits .	990.6863
newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that judas , too , had been able to smile .	429.54312
the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians usually end .	1480.8213
finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics , moscow resumed scowling and `` smilin ' mike ' ' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west .	1354.054
the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs ' , and the most inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians .	894.1198
when king saud visited washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family .	392.6015
rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds .	539.8832
the state department was little help on this , or on much else about saudi arabia .	1521.258
a reporter who consulted a middle east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the arabian-american oil company .	3508.4563
`` this is where i get my information from ' ' , he confided .	167.27487
`` but bring it right back .	1151.8644
it ' s the only copy i ' ve got ' ' .	109.81359
the size of saud ' s family was still being debated when the king appeared for his first meeting with eisenhower .	435.46527
when it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into hagerty ' s office to report on the interview .	1895.5043
the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american friendship to bore in on the central question .	2813.013
how many children did the king have ? ?	133.15938
`` twenty-one ' ' , replied the sheik .	287.08646
and how many of these were sons ? ?	197.78091
`` twenty-five ' ' , the sheik replied .	245.0247
`` do you mean to tell us ' ' , a reporter asked , `` that the king has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons ' ' ? ?	146.16093
the sheik smiled and murmured `` that is precisely correct ' ' .	354.96097
the egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language .	1271.4502
when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east peace after israel ' s 1956 invasion of egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo , a language as anarchic as casey stengel ' s .	1229.2606
the reports of president nasser ' s pledges which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the israeli foreign minister , mrs . golda meir .	2853.809
finally he reported that nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli concessions .	1137.8369
the deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside .	204.88274
i know now why our japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom .	1055.3186
of course , most toilets are eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside .	1115.761
a few newer homes have western flush toilets , but even with running water , they are usually eastern style .	5230.7466
the next day i visited international christian college which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know japan well .	921.06055
they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning .	553.4599
the library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom .	15311.335
spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be christian .	167.18382
they have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates .	428.9109
in the afternoon miss hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young mrs . kodama to see the famous spring dances of the geisha dancers .	786.7324
mrs . hosaka is one of the japanese women one reads about -- beautiful , artistically talented , an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a pampered , gentle japanese woman .	1306.2264
she was a real experience ! !	159.32912
the dances were as beautiful as anything i have ever seen -- they rival the new york rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination .	1197.022
because don was leaving the next day , i spent the evening with him at asia center .	210.24104
the following morning mr . morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- mr . yoshimoto ' s school .	355.25696
there is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected -- some think too much .	471.25702
there is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools .	197.87723
with the loss of the emperor diety in japan , the people are left in confusion with no god or moral teachings that have strength .	752.28955
the older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents .	561.992
there seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability .	656.5448
as a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value .	634.656
gambling is everywhere , especially among students .	684.8364
the government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused .	381.10675
i was told that it is quite likely that japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? ?	686.36615
it will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop .	423.27548
in the evening the former oregon state science teachers met for dinner at the new tokyo restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good .	1438.7222
they suggested several new foods , and usually i found them good , except the sweets , which i think i could learn to like .	257.26654
six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun .	418.43433
after a day at nikko , mrs . kodama put me on the train for kyoto .	929.1702
my instructions were that mr . nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome .	403.20844
my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by masu and the japan travel bureau and were more elegant than i would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be elegant -- i did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their salaries are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well .	311.0078
they understood and teased me a bit about it .	382.5201
i think i would have been much disappointed in japan if i had not seen kyoto , nara , and hiroshima .	463.86966
kyoto is the ancient capital of japan and still its cultural center .	452.35883
it , along with nara , was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar japan .	608.42487
here i was accompanied by mrs . okamoto ( fumio ' s mother ) , her son , mr . washizu ( a prospective student with whom i have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and mr . nishima , one of the science teachers .	223.51813
i arrived at 7 00 a . m . and by 9 00 a . m . i had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned .	87.64614
we walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens .	1443.9407
we visited the okamoto home -- where for the first time i saw the famous tea ceremony .	450.96365
at 6 00 p . m . we went to the kyoto spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated .	270.50378
they were even better than those of tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .	922.3716
after a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of mt . fuji ) , i returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day .	1695.5856
we started at 9 a . m . to visit the kyoto university where mr . washizu is attending .	143.97557
i was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school .	882.1591
they apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and i was a little at a loss to know what to say .	317.41092
there seemed to be no excuse ? ?	396.97238
i don ' t have the answer yet .	462.5003
we had tea at mr . washizu ' s home where i learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family .	162.33632
and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest .	165.53362
this is a significant fact in japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice .	185.91336
in his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big .	346.24594
also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc . .	1685.5325
he had displayed more of them than usual so that i could enjoy them .	412.36792
about 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum .	257.76376
the house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older , less-hurried times .	1172.3939
mr . nishima went with me on the train to nara .	284.81128
we passed his house and school on the way .	59.554512
in nara i stayed at the hotel where the prince and princess had stayed on their honeymoon .	314.72974
a new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but i walked on it , too .	165.51854
here mr . yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches .	881.09595
even though we had walked miles in kyoto that day , we started out again to see nara at night .	552.5644
in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to osaka to put me on the train for hiroshima .	399.67953
again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn ' t let me .	83.87419
at osaka , mr . yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home , but mr . nishima and i had an hour and a half before train time to see osaka at night .	272.93127
it is the second largest city in japan , with about four million people .	299.2612
one spot in osaka i shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river .	328.10135
in the midst of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light .	736.28754
my train arrived in hiroshima at the awful hour of 4 45 a . m . .	167.53838
i had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which mr . uno would arrive and pilot me around .	408.34003
but there he was at the train with an oregon state pennant in his hand .	344.94577
i know now why the students insisted that i go to hiroshima even when i told them i didn ' t want to .	207.18446
they knew that i was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if i could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret pearl harbor , i would be happier and would understand better a new japan .	344.07315
there were no words to say this but there was no need .	232.35835
the teachers of mr . uno ' s school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming .	279.99716
hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace and understanding .	207.33351
i was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience .	436.4885
a better world may yet come out of hiroshima .	588.0105
on arriving in tokyo later we were met by masu who took us immediately to her university , the japanese women ' s university .	412.72632
this day was `` open house for parents ' ' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables .	1231.5535
everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun .	1230.8108
it was thrilling to see the effect of an american-trained teacher on japanese students in a class in home planning .	627.4283
our masu is one of the very few architects in japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women ' s needs .	333.26917
i am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants .	256.89548
many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american homes , but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using japanese artfulness in our own western architecture at the same time that the japanese are adopting western utility patterns .	890.68024
at this women ' s university we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that japanese women also should be educated .	502.4232
even today there are some doubts about the value of education for japanese women , but this university continues to grow and to send its students out into the community .	310.39728
active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings .	458.10245
as far as i am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions .	623.33545
masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for japanese widows in tokyo .	2903.9424
here the women learn to keep house as maids	471.54227
they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests .	1044.4307
they learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family .	156.56572
they have model kitchens , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a nursery with a life-like doll .	561.7051
although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough .	259.09918
graduates of this maid ' s school are much in demand and can always find work immediately .	266.3633
occasionally they return for additional training .	436.17493
masu ' s home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials .	2317.302
masu also uses the training she got in an american home where she learned to polish furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a shiny house .	767.8847
her education in the united states , not just in a classroom , but also in an american house with an american housekeeper , stands her in good stead .	364.97015
after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria , the kitchen of which masu had planned , mr . washizu and i left to meet representatives of the usis for a visit to the university of tokyo .	224.1688
here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could not see , but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant .	241.31796
the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between attorney general rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be applauded .	1218.0276
but for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case .	458.98666
the suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the south , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in new york and general company policy .	624.03107
then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one .	99.29597
it would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which , for love ' s sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , indivisible from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy .	242.25034
perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation .	417.04517
such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification .	1553.4784
action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate .	989.45886
moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-civil war south , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) .	545.65906
in any case , anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by white citizens ' councils in the entire state of mississippi against every local philco dealer in that state , in protest against a philco-sponsored program over a national tv network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a `` high yellow gal ' ' smooching with a white man .	1061.098
it is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different .	144.61229
but since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force .	402.5274
the need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that white citizens ' councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence .	942.05743
an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means .	1411.0873
the end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e . g . , against negroes who register to vote in fayette county , tennessee , at the present moment .	385.55646
here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies .	3862.2625
this , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used .	446.9908
it is also sufficient to show the christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i . e . , that , if economic pressure has to be resorted to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them .	510.1934
it is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian morality , like any other form of resistance .	711.62604
the language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) .	579.4714
one of the sit-in leaders has said `` nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom of hell can stop the march to freedom .	325.806
everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them ' ' .	437.47034
the present writer certainly agrees with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice .	220.8836
however , it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward .	1077.4956
and when charity interpenetrates man ' s struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will .	504.32135
it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means .	535.6174
r . b . gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance .	1255.1481
he suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him ' '	628.7497
and again , that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope .	391.6124
in another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values ' ' .	800.26746
a trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent	391.7958
and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause .	417.65173
this makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified .	585.4737
the question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him .	814.2176
here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives	1041.8933
and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently .	710.2812
a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression .	456.9477
among christian groups , the mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the christian use of all forms of pressure .	515.1586
since the will and word of god are for them concentrated in christ-like love , it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing .	603.82104
`` the primary objective of non-violence ' ' , writes the outstanding mennonite ethicist , `` is not peace , or obedience to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage ' ' .	446.37976
without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the mennonite position and affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance .	780.5594
these principles we have now set forth .	313.29605
economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified	442.02283
and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action .	944.37195
economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed .	2236.337
that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals .	1457.1877
there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent .	396.91653
the justification in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good .	536.25885
in these terms , the `` economic withdrawal ' ' of the negroes of nashville , tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out .	361.31097
we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above .	1125.139
there may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people .	231.45436
an excellent article was published recently in the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in south africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the united states in these conditions .	337.06177
`` billions of american dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of u . s . taxpayers ' ' , this author states , `` are being poured into south africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white ' ' .	497.5838
both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail .	881.18256
this leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is inescapable that america does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue ' ' .	282.3663
our leadership in a wide economic boycott of south africa would be not only in accord , it seems , with the moral conscience of america , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in accord with our law , u . s . code title 19 , section 1307 , which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor .	472.8662
not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every american who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation ' ' .	497.9975
northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .	461.44116
they have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .	125.2546
and both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners who are called bourbons .	783.95044
the name presumably derives from the french royal house which never learned and never forgot	485.7586
since bourbon whiskey , though of kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the north as by conservatives in the south .	416.44684
the nature of the opposition between liberals and bourbons is too little understood in the north .	572.5533
the race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .	2785.297
it is these other differences between north and south -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which i chiefly discuss herein .	1209.454
i write about northern liberals from considerable personal experience .	714.9296
a southerner married to a new englander , i have lived for many years in a connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .	555.65814
most of them are democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .	772.6437
this is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government .	548.7673
yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view jefferson as one of their patron saints .	1004.9475
when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , i find that they fall into two categories the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis	660.8255
and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don ' t count any more in the world of to-day .	469.74014
i am naive , they say , to make use of such words .	116.65152
i take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? ?	443.22607
-- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it .	533.0186
this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a president of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court .	986.29193
as for states ' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .	2590.3062
the american liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case	227.7188
but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .	746.66016
why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ? ?	1899.9456
if he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? ?	235.31479
and if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? ?	641.46625
i am concerned here , however , with the northern liberal ' s attitude toward the south .	91.5483
it appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friends .	514.30426
his assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .	600.8128
time ' s editor , thomas griffith , in his book , the waist-high culture , wrote `` most of what was different about it ( the deep south ) i found myself unsympathetic to .	515.44714
' ' this , for the liberals i know , would be an understatement .	195.41603
theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against fascism .	823.47406
i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the north .	325.90015
in business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found .	370.23392
but in our case -- and neither my wife nor i have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more .	2128.1975
in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .	1014.81104
accounts have been published of northern liberals in the south up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .	1234.0012
but these accounts do not show that northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings .	1740.5791
from my wife ' s experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles .	362.86557
the strong feeling is certainly there	2539.67
but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the south , especially among those who studied in the north .	922.6298
and social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting northerners .	3159.974
also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problems .	1612.763
but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven ' t .	565.65375
my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war .	935.4322
nobody knows how many southerners there are in this category .	221.96754
i suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the north likes to believe .	609.62976
i never heard of a poll being taken on the question .	198.19885
no doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .	753.1046
prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerners would have voted against the confederacy .	493.45645
since the supreme court ' s decision of that year this is more doubtful	235.9711
and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to little rock i believe the majority would have been for the old south .	359.2109
belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .	396.47958
probably a larger percentage of virginians and south carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with georgia , north carolina , and alabama following along after them .	1705.2993
old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont	4473.604
so that a line running down the length of the south marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the old south from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .	707.5485
the long-settled areas of states like virginia and south carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .	796.4261
also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on charleston had closer ties with england and the west indies than with the north even after independence .	1471.5629
the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .	191.26788
in certain respects defeat increased the persistent anglophilia of the old south .	1384.2451
poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .	504.49307
and no doubt many people in states like the carolinas and georgia , which were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the crown .	561.66595
among bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .	630.7276
all southerners agree that slavery had to go	647.21356
but many historians maintain that except for northern meddling it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did .	862.21423
southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and reconstruction	295.01004
their fears now are of miscegenation and negro political control in many counties .	1138.1017
but apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed south -- to use the moderate words favored by mr . thomas griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the north .	560.3493
and this , in effect , means most of modern america .	452.2346
it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .	215.57115
and therein , i feel , many northerners delude themselves about the south .	824.4563
for one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed .	617.25543
there seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .	6212.708
i suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking don ' t talk about the final stages of reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .	278.37357
or else the north really believes that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the american dream , like everybody else .	841.7296
if the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .	287.5809
the situation of the south since 1865 has been unique in the western world .	529.6843
regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre-world-war- 1 great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .	1138.916
and the great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or celtic descent .	671.8442
this is the only case in modern history of a people of britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .	1715.7876
the fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .	669.82
in every war of the united states since the civil war the south was more belligerent than the rest of the country .	101.61862
so instead of being tests of the south ' s loyalty , the spanish war , the two world wars , and the korean war all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion .	423.2107
and there is no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold war against communism .	329.05222
had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , england been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to new england , there is little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain .	973.1001
it is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as southerners should have been as docile as they have .	539.5465
the north should thank its stars that such has been the case	357.84033
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .	1449.4559
the two main charges levelled against the bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .	2097.0579
there is much truth in both these charges , and not many bourbons deny them .	485.19492
whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .	328.9832
most of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .	185.9123
many northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .	227.54968
the bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of northern conservatives .	311.5096
but those among the bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .	2467.4705
they believe that if the south had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern america .	490.45404
as it is , they consider that the north is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` american way ' ' has been proved inferior to the english and scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .	429.08725
the south ' s antipathy to northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .	1583.1853
their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to southerners	5399.357
and i have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .	947.52216
in the past , the duties of the state , as sir henry maine noted long ago , were only two in number internal order and external security .	449.1918
by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders .	780.94653
outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior ' ' peoples of the non-western world , a position of dominance .	246.84485
it became the sole `` subject ' ' of `` international law ' ' ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world arena .	280.65695
( that corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .	304.17688
speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the western powers .	569.369
the enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era .	391.5909
beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .	1022.6986
this was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires .	2329.8674
that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .	1736.2844
his duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated .	409.97382
thus , to cite but one example , the pax britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the british navy ruling the seas or with the city of london ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e . g . , the united states ) may have incidentally benefited .	483.2013
at the same time , all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted .	543.6406
social darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century .	851.71375
however , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity .	1465.0271
a concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .	2331.528
already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters .	162.78993
a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned an important corner .	372.37802
in what has aptly been called a `` constitutional revolution ' ' , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` night-watchman state ' ' ) to one with affirmative duties to perform .	438.07968
the `` positive state ' ' came into existence .	71.4073
for lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the supreme court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in `` the switch in time that saved nine ' ' , president roosevelt ' s ill-starred but in effect victorious `` court-packing plan ' ' , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation .	632.47174
of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the american people .	201.21983
labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms , and all the many facets of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom .	470.53442
a national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary .	2414.4575
ratified in the republican party victory in 1952 , the positive state is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be .	657.1838
the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i . e . , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the american people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in american constitutional history .	317.3469
the other , of course , was the civil war , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation .	410.14468
a third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed american immersion and involvement in world affairs .	1297.7378
internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented .	529.28156
nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept .	306.41132
thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces ' ' to operate and cure the distress .	464.4141
that guiding principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege guns of the new deal	779.8231
less than a score of years later congress enacted the employment act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment .	434.68524
hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution .	590.8368
in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state ' s-responsibility ' ' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus .	1144.1688
the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .	656.04816
internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the industrial revolution .	293.48474
reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era .	267.50266
national responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or even to the western nations .	221.70172
a measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the international congress of jurists in 1959 .	241.06749
meeting in new delhi under the auspices of the international commission of jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the congress redefined and expanded the traditional rule of law to include affirmative governmental duties .	690.8086
it is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations .	293.01462
the rule of law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court ' ' before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare .	930.0887
recognizing that the rule of law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society ' ' , the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized ' ' .	338.43814
the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-soviet world .	605.5866
for better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .	630.8834
whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation ' s external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish .	365.30585
the hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .	1286.6241
the content is not the same , however rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group ' ' -- those in the `` free world ' ' -- that is basic .	170.80458
external national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations .	596.91156
if internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .	2015.3683
reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .	317.01523
in its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the church .	948.756
the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .	744.06525
( since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the united states as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging .	291.6782
) the concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure .	2050.1252
but it is more than that .	298.07687
for it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit .	852.5415
today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world .	483.24756
almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .	1839.8606
historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the western civilizational group .	241.92307
by subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty .	440.1125
within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied .	1054.8088
while the pattern is uneven , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the western peoples well .	740.74506
( whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today ' s nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions .	467.6657
it is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) .	1135.2064
but it is more than irony one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet .	741.9314
in other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population	955.79425
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .	1495.7847
complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty .	214.71495
the former receives its legitimacy from the latter .	816.31445
operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state .	988.34216
while sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern .	480.7777
jean bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood .	326.16165
austin ' s nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today ' s legal and political thinking .	476.94415
to him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the english monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i . e . , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations .	259.40005
these fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .	1047.145
the nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control .	1414.0852
in fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined .	794.8907
high-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .	2211.3762
that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular ' ' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .	178.86923
nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .	358.24905
is there a different reality behind the facade ? ?	524.32324
does the surface hide a quite different picture ? ?	288.29886
the short answer to those questions is `` yes ' ' .	103.573616
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .	409.45743
as evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances .	910.6155
can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ?	311.2216
what steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ?	2567.4536
are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ?	128.334
is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ?	328.32468
will the danger increase or decrease ? ?	240.09743
i have just asked these questions in the pentagon , in the white house , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` sherwood forest ' ' .	964.5463
i asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons ' ' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons .	1866.7856
to the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow ' s impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .	2979.2754
there is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .	194.72539
`` readiness exercises ' ' are almost continuous .	227.22624
each could be the real thing .	342.30185
in the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since `` e hour ' ' .	1193.774
`` e ' ' stands for `` execution ' ' -- the moment a `` go order ' ' would unleash an american nuclear strike .	343.96582
there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks .	172.1883
they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines .	2687.9895
they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .	1632.7347
accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks .	556.1973
among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware ' ' , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man ' s flair for what the professionals in this field call `` scenarios ' ' .	706.406
as an air force psychiatrist put it `` you can ' t have dry runs on this one ' ' .	829.2886
the experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might .	1513.9404
only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men the more highly placed they are -- that is , the more they know -- the more concerned they have become .	237.15608
already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security .	480.49008
only recently new `` holes ' ' were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more .	294.84534
work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons .	578.09503
meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by `` false pre-emption ' ' , `` escalation ' ' , `` unauthorized behavior ' ' and other terms that will be discussed in this report .	504.38458
they inhabit a secret world centered on `` go codes ' ' and `` gold phones ' ' .	172.0213
their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions .	5244.3926
one arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs ' ' .	214.99146
yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me -- and the experts .	323.8723
it is their job to think about the unthinkable .	400.38245
unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more russians and communist chinese , too -- thought about accidental war .	755.24725
the first systematic thinking about this pandora ' s box within pandora ' s boxes was done four years ago by fred ikle , a frail , meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist .	1397.8265
he was , and is , with the rand corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the u . s . air force .	385.29456
his investigations made him the paul revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased .	1776.8228
in recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the kennedy administration , basic united states strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible .	773.83826
the chain starts at bmews ( ballistic missile early warning system ) in thule , greenland .	4469.5913
its radar screens would register soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states .	639.60156
bmews intelligence is simultaneously flashed to norad ( north american air defense command ) in colorado springs , colorado , for interpretation	2187.7483
to the sac command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base , near omaha , nebraska	2744.3442
to the joint war room of the joint chiefs of staff in the pentagon and to the president .	244.79475
telephones , teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points .	711.7292
alternate locations exist for all key command centers .	919.63556
for last-ditch emergencies sac has alternate command posts on kc-135 jet tankers .	11826.968
multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .	701.4056
the same principle of `` redundancy ' ' applies to all communications on these special networks .	494.5688
and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources .	1458.4745
additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications .	4144.7725
only the president is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons .	312.39737
but what if somebody decides to break it ? ?	184.64407
the president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger .	1592.0048
hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons .	559.64276
what if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the russians ? ?	1376.9358
what if the president himself , in the language of the military , `` goes ape ' ' ? ?	129.00749
or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets without provocation ? ?	855.28424
nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .	134.05263
however , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war .	1530.3357
even the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a `` go ' ' order .	317.12497
even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the `` go code ' ' .	194.3457
in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` gold-phone circuit ' ' .	299.9119
a system of `` gold ' ' -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the secretary of defense , the joint chiefs of staff , the sac commander and other key men .	597.05304
all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes .	273.615
all could help the president make his decision .	1029.5326
the talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble .	1998.027
vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda .	1565.6251
officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the president ' s decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from aj .	722.16113
if communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order .	706.54315
for these centers , too , are on the gold circuit .	239.07631
they include the navy ' s atlantic command at norfolk , virginia , which is in contact with the polaris subs	611.9548
air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases	1046.0186
and sac , which controls long-range bombers and atlas missiles .	2808.6086
let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- sac at omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their aj .	1368.9749
the key man almost certainly would be col . william w . wisman , sac ' s senior controller .	371.76785
he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day .	1091.3707
it is a quiet but impressive room -- 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high .	3680.0825
movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information .	2448.718
and bill wisman , forty-three , a farmer ' s son from beallsville , ohio , is a quiet but impressive man .	846.1361
his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .	705.3421
his movements and speech are precise , clear and quick .	571.8419
no question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .	512.94574
wisman , who has had the chief controller ' s job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .	880.9645
at least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him .	518.5874
in front of him is a gold phone .	485.1121
in emergencies the sac commander , gen . thomas power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman and his staff .	610.5336
at general power ' s seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .	294.60883
general power would participate in the decision making .	175.86343
wisman , below , would listen in and act .	383.86105
his consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every sac aircraft .	1162.1476
he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert .	733.417
( there are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .	849.3574
but wisman , too , does not know the go code .	263.33755
he must take it from `` the red box ' ' .	114.43565
in point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to wisman ' s right .	366.5501
the box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( `` it ' s real obnoxious ' ' ) .	1301.3368
now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation ' s most guarded secrets .	307.87457
the codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed x-ray-proof `` unique device ' ' .	708.1223
they are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by wisman or his staff , at random intervals .	525.99194
but even the contents of wisman ' s box cannot start a war .	336.00638
they are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .	671.3632
what these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .	723.15625
the pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by wisman ' s staff .	217.1283
in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator ' ' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .	1150.666
i asked wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .	847.55994
`` i ' d wind up full of bullet holes ' ' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .	361.56366
now let us imagine a wing of b-52 ' s , on alert near their `` positive control ( or fail-safe ) points ' ' , the spots on the map , many miles from soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets .	452.73795
they , too , have fragments of the go code with them .	817.5501
as wisman put it , `` they have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie .	1049.8182
once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it .	219.00943
unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing ' ' .	229.09425
why does wisman ' s ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ?	2057.273
the answer is a cryptographic secret .	44262.207
at any rate , three men out of a six-man b-52 crew are required to copy down wisman ' s go-to-war message .	4116.555
each must match wisman ' s `` pie ' ' with the fragment that he carries with him .	162.30186
all three must compare notes and agree to `` go ' ' .	153.31763
after that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .	690.2051
unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done .	659.16095
suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended .	732.9073
they went as rigid as black statuary six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still .	2662.8562
their heads were in the air sniffing .	1597.2765
they all swung at the same instant in the same direction .	181.82469
they saw it before i did , even with my binoculars .	436.60593
it was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth .	650.6532
in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more .	1839.3922
a white man would not have seen it .	113.75966
the aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .	1446.0457
watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land .	986.86914
at once the whole band set off at a lope .	1471.1671
they were chasing a rain cloud .	1448.3906
they went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .	4704.295
i followed them in the jeep and now they did not care .	170.16171
the games were over , this was life .	190.94273
occasionally , for no reason that i could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot .	253.96443
sometimes i guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .	612.80396
sometimes it was to skirt a gulley .	12459.395
their gait is impossible to convey in words .	131.71832
it has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve .	663.4074
it is the gait of the human who must run to live arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful .	1085.9207
it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .	465.20203
finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall .	1186.0186
for ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering .	603.961
then the wind died and the rain squall held steady .	771.73676
suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground .	522.7004
he had found a depression with rain water in it .	697.77344
he bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground .	515.8868
with a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows .	1095.5889
the other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle .	5906.0415
in an instant he had sucked it dry .	13808.4795
the aborigine lives on the cruelest land i have ever seen .	765.00336
which does not mean that it is ugly .	134.63493
part of it is , of course .	57.615494
there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous .	1837.4136
they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand .	1477.848
such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality .	12581.796
but much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable .	906.7531
it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .	1676.4188
the malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the australian charles bean .	907.2526
he tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer .	2605.8105
they went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback ' ' country .	351.88742
the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps .	3262.9387
nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men .	754.5633
there might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps only -- there was not .	503.25616
it might have rained , any time	201.7521
there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise	594.64056
they lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them .	2166.19
and countless others like them have died .	766.51904
even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .	1146.2183
he knows that the land is hard and pitiless .	1695.9712
he knows that the economy of life in the `` outback ' ' is awful .	187.52837
there is no room for error or waste .	739.86176
any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done .	4871.014
i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but i suspect that it can .	184.64468
perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity .	802.8516
seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing .	150.2217
many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports .	1315.769
others are confined to vast reservations , and not only does the australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed .	970.9902
i persuaded an australian friend who had lived `` outback ' ' for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush .	286.57724
it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation , even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language .	313.6386
finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a land rover .	314.82278
we followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth .	560.7692
the rancher went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road .	581.005
at once he started to glance toward the instrument panel .	907.64813
it took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel there was a gimbaled compass welded to it , which rocked gently back and forth as the land rover bounced about .	2332.7256
the rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .	862.94684
`` do you always navigate like this ' ' ? ?	210.19482
`` damned right ' ' , he said .	9.504068
`` once i get out on the flat i do .	173.61957
some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks , a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there .	422.67606
but if you don ' t know the place like the palm of your hand , you ' d better use a compass and the speedometer .	198.77667
two miles northeast , then five miles southwest that sort of thing .	1706.9539
i would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless .	947.72144
finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .	813.39954
they were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder a man , his lubra , and two children .	1047.3481
the sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder .	378.0407
there was also a dog , a dingo dog .	1931.0271
its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches .	1193.1852
it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully .	1912.4216
it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .	2086.714
`` the buggers love shade ' ' , the rancher said .	186.43349
`` i suppose because it saves them some loss of body water .	586.4704
they ' ll move around that rock all day , following the shade .	447.72806
during the hottest part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there isn ' t any shade ' ' .	104.09433
we drove close to the boulder , stopped the land rover , and walked over toward the family .	466.5391
the man was leaning against the rock .	144.21558
he gazed away from us as we approached .	685.2046
he was over six feet tall and very thin .	544.5972
his legs were narrow and very long .	299.6726
every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving .	222.16545
he had long black hair and a wispy beard .	2724.8303
the ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .	1571.9852
there was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .	753.7524
it was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets .	5633.3647
a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man ' s lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink .	437.92386
the australian and i both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .	2407.309
i turned to look at the lubra .	449.58118
she remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there	398.36005
like the man , she was entirely naked .	395.36514
her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her .	769.54407
there were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent .	2224.2886
there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy .	2183.8105
there was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .	19336.781
everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless .	492.71182
the two children , both boys , wandered around the australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work .	612.0788
they squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground .	683.12225
they had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and pinched them dead .	401.62515
the tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple .	1156.5623
the odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines .	878.7266
the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .	1183.3511
it was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed .	450.34048
one ' s impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant .	398.34085
but that is a cliche and a dishonest one .	759.5399
the smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it .	634.3068
their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .	492.5248
they roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it .	1556.1147
in spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and i realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared	2052.9375
as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic .	1174.8865
the boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .	1781.5669
`` that smell is something , eh , mate ' ' ? ?	231.55956
`` they swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other .	3010.4155
at the corroborees , when they get to dancing and sweating , you ' ll see them rubbing up against a man who ' s supposed to have a specially good smell .	660.3725
idje , here ' ' , and he nodded at the man , `` is said to have great odor .	183.77754
the stink is all the same to me , but i really think they can make one another out blindfolded ' ' .	205.99242
`` here , idje , you fella like tabac ' ' ? ?	292.345
idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .	235.19374
the australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin i could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest .	541.1068
it was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in persian art .	180.57782
the architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through abbas ' s reign and those of his successors to enrich the city .	1418.7854
travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .	2591.2095
at the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be `` as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a market as any in the universe ' ' .	331.26874
in time isfahan came to be known as `` half the world ' ' , isfahan nisf-i-jahan .	409.83408
in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of london , started to decline .	245.47491
the safavids fell from power	4802.97
isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old persia and sometimes of the east .	321.00977
they think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor .	1275.1381
those who actually get there find that it isn ' t spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .	382.66003
but even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which persia lies well preserved but indeed dead .	570.54956
everyone is ready to grant the persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .	350.66415
it seems that for persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present .	498.90616
the one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called `` historical monuments ' ' .	413.24997
however , just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared .	473.29144
the values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes .	492.90613
often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply `` historical monuments ' '	537.4884
they are the places where persians live .	6037.9575
the promenade , for example , continues to take place on the chahar bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city ' s principal street .	774.8673
it takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square .	243.66092
on fridays , the day when many persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into chehel sotun -- a pavilion and garden built by shah abbas 2 , in the seventeenth century -- but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former .	758.3786
and of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar .	503.48853
those three other great activities of the persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of persian domestic architecture long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches .	858.5196
but more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities .	883.6929
water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness .	477.21805
i should like , by the way , to make it clear that i am not using the word `` persians ' ' carelessly .	206.74551
i don ' t mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool .	1063.6802
these things are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary .	483.76425
the men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer ' s night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses .	1227.414
a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor .	998.4387
not long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks .	1158.6897
the air , he said , was just right	161.73003
a cigarette would taste particularly good .	559.3759
i really didn ' t know what he meant .	62.229183
it was a nice day , granted .	214.91347
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .	1853.6313
the natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of persians a great deal of attention .	551.8158
the line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from hafiz , the purity of spring water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion -- these things are noticed , judged , and valued .	679.2906
nowhere in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge .	710.414
there has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city .	164.60646
for one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed	813.0261
for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in .	424.34573
it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that shah abbas 2 , in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge .	1095.1798
from upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river	2779.0195
from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .	741.88074
the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .	2420.5347
at either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses .	4052.2625
here , in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between .	427.7039
below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge .	2513.0652
these are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .	614.68134
down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools .	991.5658
here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults .	443.36496
on the downstream , or `` pavilion ' ' , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself .	984.28015
from the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river .	1639.4972
out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge .	446.31592
on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge .	440.37198
the bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera .	656.8345
crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege .	776.62103
all kinds come to walk in the promenade merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal	1409.4054
a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket	15637.39
dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions	2053.3499
the old kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines	7609.2466
students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns .	2076.1655
families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar .	648.77423
below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river .	423.05612
above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance .	1861.7329
here in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face .	463.46967
to a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for persians chase the golden calf as much as any people .	1141.6194
many of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant .	661.1965
nonetheless , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks .	575.3412
above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry .	292.9361
poetry in persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand .	1082.0522
it contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life .	204.55365
and it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form .	130.20717
poetry for a persian is nothing less than truth and beauty .	441.24722
in most western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .	522.04083
in persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for that matter , hardly any books , the twins run free .	702.2951
it is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on london bridge the teddy boys of the east end will gather to sing marlowe , herrick , shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .	729.58923
that , at any rate , is what happens at the khaju bridge .	425.0296
boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .	613.5697
here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which persian music is divided .	536.6891
each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .	250.2098
the singer simply matches the poem to a mode	512.23883
for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem `` they brought me news that spring is in the plains and ahmad ' s blood the crimson tulip stains	1829.1039
go , tell his aged mother that her son fought with a thousand foes , and he was one ' ' .	296.12302
or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet `` know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth , that here , with dust upon his eyes , iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .	1185.6538
in this true lover ' s tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred .	2132.3357
these songs ( practically all persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves .	641.59686
yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque .	1356.185
die frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben jahr , the maestro quoted the flying dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times .	1136.1107
the music director of the pittsburgh symphony orchestra , william steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life .	510.07004
when he added to his pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the london philharmonic orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting ' ' between the two cities .	724.37555
this schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious mr . steinberg .	468.51587
his london contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , `` i conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts ' ' ! !	771.1118
our meeting took place in may , 1961 , during one of the maestro ' s stop-overs in new york , before he left for europe .	234.15463
as we began to converse in the lounge of his fifth avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .	1067.2427
seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off .	1259.6005
unfortunately , it was muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured .	3731.183
as he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled .	1158.9427
did he come from a musical family ? ?	145.19933
yes though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family .	588.5286
in his native cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet .	250.84282
she even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values .	578.6179
when he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter a , instead of c , as in the scale .	288.31317
because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing czerny etudes , he composed his own studies .	3305.229
when he was eight he began violin lessons .	1133.5625
soon he was playing in the cologne municipal orchestra , and during world war 1 , , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well .	615.4729
steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .	1690.3575
`` by observing the conductor ' ' , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , `` i learned how not to conduct ' ' .	117.1121
the musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the gymnasium .	564.36835
simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano .	677.86914
his professional career began when he was twenty	208.70831
he became otto klemperer ' s personal assistant at the cologne opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor .	304.9985
wasn ' t this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? ?	861.422
had he always wished to be a conductor ? ?	45.536484
no , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such .	319.4443
however , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist .	292.29944
five years were spent with the cologne opera , after which he was called to prague by alexander von zemlinsky , teacher of arnold schonberg and erich korngold .	1422.7567
in 1927 he succeeded zemlinsky as opera director of the german theater at prague .	1252.1406
during his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the berlin state opera .	1347.4933
two years later he became director of the frankfurt opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the hitler regime .	342.18924
during these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in germany .	517.7683
he had presented the first german performances of puccini ' s manon lescaut and de falla ' s la vida breve .	1869.2379
the frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of berg ' s wozzek soon after the berlin premiere under erich kleiber , and the world premiere of schonberg ' s von heute auf morgen .	1178.5117
at the outset of his career , steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a schonberg work every year .	1128.4478
in frankfurt , too , he directed the museum and opera house concerts which , in addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like erdmann ' s piano concerto and mahler ' s sixth symphony .	962.4463
because of the political upheaval in germany in the 1930 ' s , steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the jewish community .	313.8244
through the frankfurt jewish kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with cellist emanuel feuermann .	6860.471
as more and more jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations steinberg united them into the frankfurt kulturbund orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other german cities .	1673.3049
in 1936 he accepted the leadership of the berlin kulturbund .	327.62344
in the fall of that year the best musicians of the berlin and frankfurt kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of bronislaw hubermann and steinberg to become the palestine orchestra -- now known as the israel philharmonic orchestra -- with steinberg as founder-conductor .	2154.7488
in 1938 , at the insistence of arturo toscanini , steinberg left germany for the united states , by way of switzerland .	434.61163
after he had spent the first three years in new york as associate conductor , at toscanini ' s invitation , of the nbc orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the united states and latin america .	314.82623
in 1945 he became conductor of the buffalo philharmonic .	774.4174
seven years later he was asked to become director of the pittsburgh symphony .	186.14604
since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the san francisco opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of verdi ' s falstaff .	980.67706
in recent years he has traveled widely in europe , conducting in italy , france , austria , and switzerland .	440.44968
he returned to germany for the first time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in cologne , frankfurt , and berlin .	245.05647
where in europe was he going now ? ?	1011.7381
first of all , to italy for a short vacation -- forte dei marmi , a place he loves .	1245.4369
since it is not far from viareggio , he will visit puccini ' s house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of la boheme , which he considers one of puccini ' s masterpieces .	482.4162
steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about italy `` rome is my second home .	577.217
i consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year ' ' .	99.49731
he will conduct two concerts at the accademia di santa cecilia , as well as concerts in munich and cologne .	1155.6737
`` then i return to the united states for engagements at the hollywood bowl and in philadelphia ' ' , he added .	105.10814
the forthcoming season in pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest .	491.48764
there will be premieres of new works , made possible through ford foundation commissions carlisle floyd ' s mystery , with phyllis curtin as soprano soloist .	5898.3926
other world premieres will be gardner read ' s third symphony and burle marx ' s samba concertante .	3511.5056
`` and next year we will do -- also a ford commission -- a piano concerto by elliott carter , with jacob lateiner as soloist .	1298.9209
of course , i shall conduct mahler and bruckner works in the coming season , as usual .	675.5977
we ' ll play bruckner ' s fifth symphony in the original version , and mahler ' s seventh -- the least accessible , known , and played of mahler ' s works .	432.14795
my pittsburghers have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner ' ' .	652.46265
he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour , especially mahler ' s first and fourth symphonies , and das lied von der erde , and bruckner ' s sixth -- which is rarely played -- and seventh .	652.1886
bruckner ' s eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony ' ' .	212.39627
he recalled that in california after a critic had attacked him for `` still trying to sell bruckner to the americans ' ' , the public ' s response at the next concert was a standing ovation .	423.79593
`` now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us , i am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of leonard bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner and mahler ' ' .	1280.9905
since he introduces so much modern music , i could not resist asking how he felt about it .	356.73633
`` there was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created .	251.25401
but i usually stick to the old phrase ' ich habe ein amt , aber keine meinung ( i hold an office , but i do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) .	316.83704
i consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today ' ' .	170.75685
with all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?	277.60608
he had just paid a brief visit to the frick collection to admire his favorite paintings by rembrandt and franz hals .	2862.0073
he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired claude lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a poussin exhibit he had been able to see in paris a year ago .	913.12744
and how did he feel about modern art ? ?	442.86755
again steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .	374.529
`` as my wife puts it ' ' , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , `` all you know is your music .	159.35388
but after all , you never learned anything else ' ' ! !	106.93418
what did he do for relaxation ? ?	465.8009
like his late colleague , mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular sir arthur conan doyle .	1448.5232
he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature .	1700.4987
but his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son .	348.7974
at the moment he was excited about his son ' s having received the prix de rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an etruscan tomb .	808.28894
`` both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement ' ' .	986.8263
`` is the attitude of german youth comparable to that of `` the angry young men ' of england ' ' ? ?	182.83853
was the topic for a round-table discussion at the bayerische rundfunk in munich .	13260.554
i was chairman , the only not youthful participant .	918.92676
since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , i added to my opening statement a sentence in which i claimed that german youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry .	1242.9854
i was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly .	579.1264
`` it is easy for you to talk ' '	186.744
countered a twenty year old law student , `` you travel around the world .	311.74994
we would like to do that too ' ' .	43.720665
`` but you want a job guaranteed when you return ' ' , i continued my attack .	386.6392
`` you must have some security ' ' , said a young clerk .	203.59448
when i mentioned that for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly .	705.94507
one girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .	290.6502
`` would you advise us to act the same way ? ?	133.3807
i think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck ' ' .	205.96906
others mentioned that i might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding .	369.55222
the debate needed no additional controversy and soon i could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .	448.5095
though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .	515.737
what they wished for most was security	830.44006
what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country .	520.71124
the ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children .	328.10104
no one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory .	516.29254
all expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .	607.42676
once again , as in the days of the founding fathers , america faces a stern test .	309.1652
that test , as president kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his state of the union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure ' ' .	401.5133
it is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril ' ' and of `` national opportunity ' ' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation .	184.17943
incapable of self-delusion , the founding fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty .	979.2126
seven founders -- george washington , benjamin franklin , john adams , thomas jefferson , alexander hamilton , james madison and john jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation .	644.3845
in certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way .	413.86542
as madison commented to jefferson in 1789 , `` we are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us .	949.20715
our successors will have an easier task ' ' .	145.58417
they thought of themselves , to use jefferson ' s words , as `` the argonauts ' ' who had lived in `` the heroic age ' ' .	156.33632
accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity .	1410.5133
their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved ' ' .	956.6518
strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the founding seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .	1115.7355
even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning american independence and founding a new nation .	830.4908
before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .	518.87335
certainly no other seven american statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years .	937.4174
eldest of the seven , benjamin franklin , a new englander transplanted to philadelphia , wrote the most dazzling success story in our history .	1035.8744
the young printer ' s apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman .	1044.0084
author of the albany plan of union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the revolution , he fought the colonists ' front-line battles in london , negotiated the treaty of alliance with france and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the federal convention .	723.0525
on a military mission for his native virginia the youthful george washington touched off the french and indian war , then guarded his colony ' s frontier as head of its militia .	825.4338
commanding the continental army for six long years of the revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory .	170.41742
retiring to his beloved mount vernon , he returned to preside over the federal convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected president .	619.6131
during his two terms the constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fixed .	656.14105
john adams fashioned much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of massachusetts , negotiated , with franklin and jay , the peace with britain and served as our first vice president and our second president .	547.80383
his political opponent and lifetime friend , thomas jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the declaration of independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the louisiana territory during his first term as president .	599.0495
during the greater part of jefferson ' s career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow virginian , james madison , eight years his junior .	633.81793
the active sponsor of jefferson ' s measure for religious liberty in virginia , madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the constitution and in securing its ratification in virginia , founded the first political party in american history , and , as jefferson ' s secretary of state and his successor in the presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with britain .	334.89084
if franklin was an authentic genius , then alexander hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy .	1256.7465
his revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders .	300.0734
principal author of `` the federalist ' ' , he swung new york over from opposition to the constitution to ratification almost single-handedly .	1231.8666
his collaboration with washington , begun when he was the general ' s aide during the revolution , was resumed when he entered the first cabinet as secretary of the treasury .	178.91376
his bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions .	481.86398
less dazzling than hamilton , less eloquent than jefferson , john jay commands an equally high rank among the founding fathers .	2085.8008
he served as president of the continental congress .	183.03593
he played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with great britain that ended the revolution , and directed america ' s foreign affairs throughout the confederation period .	667.5402
as first chief justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated john marshall .	3960.8806
he ended his public career as a two-term governor of new york .	1273.2224
these seven founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed .	1484.6207
their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with washington , jefferson and jay	477.64578
in others by business and professional acumen , as with franklin and adams , or , in hamilton ' s case , by an influential marriage .	384.58255
unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the revolution started .	1724.1704
as different physically as the tall , angular jefferson was from the chubby , rotund adams , the seven were striking individualists .	1652.5388
ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking .	1350.805
capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens .	1057.9445
john adams dismissed john dickinson , who voted against the declaration of independence , as `` a certain great fortune and piddling genius ' ' .	446.57883
washington castigated his critic , general conway , as being capable of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity ' ' .	2607.5283
and hamilton , who felt it `` a religious duty ' ' to oppose aaron burr ' s political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint .	611.84534
the seven founders were completely dedicated to the public service .	430.71283
madison once remarked `` my life has been so much a public one ' ' , a comment which fits the careers of the other six .	227.73172
franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests .	527.31616
washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management .	868.68713
he served as commander in chief during the revolution without compensation .	498.63217
john adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , jeremiah gridley , to `` pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it ' ' .	320.9862
in taking account of seventeen years of law practice , adams concluded that `` no lawyer in america ever did so much business as i did ' ' and `` for so little profit ' ' .	304.61017
when the revolution broke out , he , along with jefferson and jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice .	382.30746
hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter washington ' s cabinet .	310.4325
while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .	1117.8678
`` if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars ' ' , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was secretary of the treasury .	374.16092
to support his large family hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service .	529.9202
talleyrand passed his new york law office one night on the way to a party .	258.6765
hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle .	463.58197
`` i have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in order to support his family ' ' , he reflected .	249.26974
all seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .	1196.1644
john adams asserted in the continental congress ' declaration of rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the british constitution and the common law , and jefferson appealed in the declaration of independence `` to the tribunal of the world ' ' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature ' s god ' ' .	239.7638
they fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of 1783 .	1968.3894
this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between john jay and a tory refugee , peter van schaack .	1133.5398
jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend van schaack .	655.02637
yet when , at war ' s end , the ex-tory made the first move to resume correspondence , jay wrote him from paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement	727.35706
`` as an independent american i considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that john jay never ceased to be the friend of peter van schaack ' ' .	347.43225
the latter in turn assured him that `` were i arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , i should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause ' ' .	422.91336
all seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation .	501.2992
`` we have now a national character to establish ' ' , washington wrote in 1783 .	288.43845
`` think continentally ' ' , hamilton counseled the young nation .	226.72925
this new force , love of country , super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one ' s own state , was epitomized by washington .	1641.5656
his first inaugural address speaks of `` my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love ' ' .	653.37146
all sought the fruition of that nationalism in a federal government with substantial powers .	241.18843
save jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the federal constitution .	464.61636
they supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable .	277.78696
historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the seventeen nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs . limited government , with hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and jefferson and madison upholding the latter position .	1309.0873
the state ' s rights position was formulated by jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better hamiltonians than jeffersonians .	1225.4688
in purchasing louisiana , jefferson had to adopt hamilton ' s broad construction of the constitution , and so did madison in advocating the rechartering of hamilton ' s bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a hamiltonian protective tariff .	932.09595
indeed , the old jeffersonians were far more atune to the hamilton-oriented whigs than they were to the jacksonian democrats .	4375.6943
when , in 1832 , the south carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which madison had advanced in his old virginia resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman .	1799.5599
in his political testament , `` advice to my country ' ' , penned just before his death , madison expressed the wish `` that the union of the states be cherished and perpetuated .	636.4549
let the open enemy to it be regarded as a pandora with her box opened	1039.5525
and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into paradise ' ' .	1201.1261
nostalgic yankee readers of erskine caldwell are today informed by proud georgians that tobacco road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the dow-jones average than with the cotton crop .	4176.918
thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the south -- an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of southern writers .	417.1637
indeed , it seems that only in today ' s southern fiction does tobacco road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom .	1785.1981
those writers known collectively as the `` southern school ' ' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize	1721.4258
according to many critics , in fact , the south has led the north in literature since the civil war , both quantitatively and qualitatively .	248.4109
such writers as william faulkner and robert penn warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .	1827.308
it is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season ' s cotton and tobacco crops	1909.637
of the stereotyped negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields	11599.287
of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the south its progressive leaps of the past century .	1345.2744
this is not to say that the south is no longer agrarian	604.5571
such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .	1597.8774
but the south is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature .	532.1214
in 1900 the south was only 15% urban	4055.1272
in 1950 it had become 47 . 1% urban .	6038.0957
in a mere half-century the south has more than tripled its urban status .	815.17126
there is a new south emerging , a south losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades .	1298.4087
as the new south snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the north -- a tendency which willard thorp terms `` yankeefication ' ' , as evidenced in such cities as charlotte , birmingham , and houston .	1010.56885
it is said that , even at the present stage of southern urbanization , such a city as atlanta is not distinctly unlike columbus or trenton .	573.71173
undoubtedly even the old southern stalwart richmond has felt the new wind william styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for bankhead mcgruder , a civil war general , now renamed , in typical california fashion , `` buena vista terrace ' ' .	2153.358
the effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .	3264.9155
as for progress , the `` backward south ' ' can boast of baton rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126 , 000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25 , 000 .	545.42365
the field , then , is ripe for new southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the southern yankeefication the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems	585.5798
the list is , obviously , endless .	1063.3379
but these sources have not been tapped .	475.20364
truman capote is still reveling in southern gothicism , exaggerating the old southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday .	2170.8887
william styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a southern writer and yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he publishes .	803.153
even the great god faulkner , the south ' s one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters	723.96326
such are simply not within his bounded province .	2402.934
where are the writers to treat these changes ? ?	225.09166
has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ? ?	2112.7476
perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades .	1325.559
lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as confederate money .	691.6514
an example of the changes which have crept over the southern region may be seen in the southern negro ' s quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 .	525.1419
today the negro must discover his role in an industrialized south , which indicates that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma hasn ' t changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint .	386.7657
the negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one .	604.42773
this represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .	489.6677
but there have been abrupt changes as well the sit-ins , the picket lines , the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago .	636.0659
today ' s evidence , such as the fact that only three southern states ( south carolina , alabama and mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday ' s southerners into speechlessness .	875.664
other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses	613.17426
his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the supreme court decision of 1954 .	971.82074
then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it	1655.3859
only historical evolution will determine which ) an abrupt change .	819.0176
since 1954 the negro ' s desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion .	852.19354
he has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws .	589.0123
this bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the southern way of existence .	673.91626
a new order is thrusting itself into being .	1656.5902
a new south is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man .	880.1402
the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern fiction .	864.1467
it is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters `` yassuhs ' ' and `` sho ' nufs ' ' with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in old south terms , `` massuh ' ' ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as caldwell ' s lester .	1305.948
while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through the rural south , such men appear to be a vanishing breed .	1864.7341
writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man	344.95233
but they obviously mean by this , not a negro personality , but a negro type .	210.81656
presenting an individualized negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could tackle	288.5269
and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare .	1019.1881
just as the negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature .	1226.7234
the book concerned with the negro ' s role in an urban society is rare indeed	370.86243
recently only keith wheeler ' s novel , peaceable lane , has openly faced the problem .	338.6068
all but the most rabid of confederate flag wavers admit that the old southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .	3885.0518
many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious old south ' ' imagery , creating such lasting impressions as margaret mitchell ' s `` tara ' ' plantation .	1006.95306
modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .	1089.6235
perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing	3757.099
but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .	773.55237
as john t . westbrook says in his article , `` twilight of southern regionalism ' ' ( southwest review , winter 1957 ) `` the miasmal mausoleum where an old south , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with ' ' .	1556.0176
westbrook further bemoans the southern writers ' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting yankees `` our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence ( of urbanization ) presented to his senses .	1270.9181
he is too deeply steeped in william faulkner and robert penn warren .	2199.5808
the fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hogs and night riders .	1045.5753
on this trip to the south he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight ' ' .	1019.77924
obviously , such a northern tourist ' s purpose is somewhat akin to a child ' s experience with disneyland he wants to see a world of make-believe .	584.9363
in the meantime , while the south has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious yankee , southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region ' s progress .	767.00824
willard thorp , in his new book , american writing in the twentieth century , observes , quite validly it seems `` certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched .	760.33136
no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what herrick , dreiser , and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did for new york .	3786.2556
there are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south ' ' .	226.98454
not a single southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material .	575.2112
faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard .	674.677
faulkner culminates the southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done .	727.458
he has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably .	459.69235
he treats it with a mythological , universal application .	1254.1819
as his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes families .	641.0296
even two decades ago in go down , moses faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the south might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil .	841.7044
yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .	491.11563
faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of yoknapatawpha county , the gradual changes which seep into the south , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the old way .	1668.9055
thus faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the `` new ' ' south has gradually evolved out of the old south , and consequently its agrarian roots persist .	487.6489
yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself the problems with which a new south must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization .	1747.4766
with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil .	553.1997
the thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas .	2480.8845
another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre .	183.44818
most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting .	709.8471
but robert rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them .	776.9178
he has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for mr . cunningham ' s summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity .	937.74603
for mr . taylor ' s images and reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl ' s cape lined with grass .	1011.07446
mr . nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .	528.28485
in fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound .	996.0558
to raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , mr . nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit .	589.7407
he began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be .	327.44415
he went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them .	465.96884
the depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .	881.5826
in each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .	238.72556
the dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself .	844.5938
or , clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a `` finial ' ' .	861.2047
as the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give birth to a new being .	2038.8699
from this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .	1567.9778
thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition .	1187.289
but , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ? ?	693.1995
some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work .	963.8254
others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .	523.5293
an approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of charles olson ' s statement of the process of projective verse `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception ' ' .	691.8157
the creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .	500.8438
he disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre .	5804.676
the unit of form is determined subjectively `` the heart , by the way of the breath , to the line ' ' .	101.228096
the test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters .	986.59625
an earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious .	988.1957
the resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .	727.5669
the contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .	841.8637
he is still concerned , however , with a personal event .	70.6406
he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation .	249.14449
the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .	184.7428
some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth .	431.7741
rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world .	1150.129
but in this approach it is the artist ' s ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work .	214.65106
others look to more objective devices of order .	258.4223
the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities .	2574.9275
the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) .	844.7968
he may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .	388.5037
but he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .	655.93396
the system works as an impersonal mechanism .	914.0562
musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .	3849.5793
again , the composer must select his own materials .	746.7471
but a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the i ching , the chinese book of changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials .	913.9202
avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned to similar approaches .	474.4936
some let dances take their form from the experience of creation .	209.33322
according to katherine litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance ' ' .	89.20135
the process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it .	380.5126
the sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap	1717.7786
or it may involve more subtle distinctions the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head .	566.97235
even the least alteration will change the quality .	173.21117
an exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance .	821.86646
the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for miss litz , or spontaneous , as it is for merle marsicano .	655.60345
she , too , is concerned with `` the becoming , the process of realization ' ' , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns .	341.76492
the design is determined emotionally `` i must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me ' ' .	964.0047
looking back , miss marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson pollock .	1339.7716
at one time she felt impelled to make dances that `` moved all over the stage ' ' , much as pollock ' s paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas .	497.73093
but her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself .	693.64197
midi garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .	917.688
it may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground .	909.5892
this became a dance called prelude to flight .	1962.4169
a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .	1548.5344
alwin nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .	1943.6488
he seeks to make his dancers more `` godlike ' ' by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light , color , and sound .	524.376
if his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from mars , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities .	238.08112
it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered .	1568.6255
in his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the `` first revealed stroke of its existence ' ' , states the theme from which all else must follow .	361.6385
the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .	440.0762
it may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions .	1219.1798
it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs .	405.9014
unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content ' ' .	350.9959
movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .	1932.725
but the metamorphosis must come first .	198.66345
though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , merce cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim .	2771.4314
he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect .	424.7474
he bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .	294.28772
an order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered ' ' .	613.9528
thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well .	338.29535
chance , he finds , enables him to create `` a world beyond imagination ' ' .	319.02023
he cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert `` why , it ' s extremely interesting .	327.93024
but i would never have thought of it myself ' ' .	224.39316
the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life .	558.60596
at one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly	18329.953
nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella .	2646.9268
a man and a girl happen to meet	896.0584
they look straight at the audience , not at each other .	101.507286
he lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .	1072.6097
if one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon .	1369.0807
their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all .	131.7503
the sequence is determined by chance , and mr . cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices .	350.07874
he may take slips of paper from a grab bag .	443.58762
the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed .	467.68307
the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance .	118.55531
the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance .	300.9663
the `` approximate ' ' is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable .	197.28622
if a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance .	773.5948
and any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether .	492.81357
mr . cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method	1395.9355
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .	1160.6577
however , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute .	899.25494
he must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .	982.9078
he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .	796.98724
the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the founding fathers .	509.94214
the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of webster and calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee .	686.3439
the people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their union .	304.35666
repeated efforts -- beginning with the missouri compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as clay and douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action .	952.9804
even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century .	379.37466
nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .	858.7173
the present issue in atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the american one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by civil war .	845.0954
and so i would only touch upon it now ( much as i have long wanted to write a book about it ) .	571.0082
i think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject .	717.1472
the difference came down to this the southern states insisted that the united states was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a union of states .	399.26773
to their leaders the constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it .	390.81378
this right of the state , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the union government .	367.50903
the champions of the union maintained that the constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of america , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could .	377.7495
writing to speed on august 24 , 1855 , lincoln made the latter point clear .	936.93115
in homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede .	882.2012
we began by declaring that all men are created equal .	466.68976
we now practically read it , all men are created equal except negroes .	628.8543
when the know-nothings get control , it will read , all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics .	403.39764
when it comes to this , i shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy ' ' ( his emphasis )	829.1193
when the southern states exercised their `` right to secede ' ' , they formed what they officially styled `` the confederate states of america ' ' .	528.21686
dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the articles of confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy .	403.7344
the fact is that the southern confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the federal constitution did .	756.2256
the confederate constitution copied much of the federal constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance .	361.38422
it operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the federal constitution .	387.7495
it made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .	459.2071
the difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861	409.36884
many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the constitution of the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede .	319.13904
but though each of its members had asserted this right against the union , the final constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .	860.81384
its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution .	483.63232
their president , jefferson davis , interpreted their constitution to mean that it `` admits of no coerced association ' ' , but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the constitution ' ' .	390.79758
the constitution of the southern `` confederation ' ' differed from that of the federal union only in two important respects it openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the federal constitution .	725.53845
they recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .	591.5997
' ' the other important difference between the two constitutions was that the president of the confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .	394.0691
these are not , however , differences in federal structure .	205.11107
the only important differences from that standpoint , between the two constitutions , lies in their preambles .	479.6408
the one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .	570.1919
here are the two preambles federal constitution , 1789	7652.8613
`` we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america ' ' .	427.93973
`` we the people of the confederate states , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of almighty god -- do ordain and establish this constitution for the confederate states of america ' ' .	657.7669
one is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought .	193.54066
but though the southern states , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states .	643.26825
if the union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union .	309.9945
lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the union a vital one whether it was a union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to `` anarchy or despotism ' ' .	427.91687
much as he abhorred slavery , lincoln was always willing to concede to each `` slave state ' ' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it .	478.62457
though his election was interpreted by many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union , lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the constitution gave the states .	438.49472
after the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action even in the border states that stayed with the union .	301.30478
he issued his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the union .	605.9141
in his message of december 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which i would call the lincoln law of liberty-and-union `` in giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free ' ' .	294.08194
what lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the union .	313.6808
he fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people ' ' .	68.87801
the truth on each side won in the civil war	228.72327
the fact that the americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater .	470.40387
out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the south as in the north , as america ' s true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom ' ' , as lincoln promised .	178.18666
but before this came about , 214 , 938 americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .	598.80963
on their decisive battlefield lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here ' ' .	518.7608
he understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his second inaugural .	489.078
to my knowledge , lincoln remains the only head of state and commander-in-chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .	455.41046
so great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .	554.43115
it is much less difficult now than in lincoln ' s day to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the states and to their union .	469.69672
they differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth that individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves .	502.9721
the 140 , 414 americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion ' ' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the united states from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .	653.26306
but the fact that 70 , 524 other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served liberty-and-union in other essential ways .	2005.41
its appeal from ballots to bullets at fort sumter ended by costing the southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man .	837.1557
the very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure .	699.5018
there was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .	2710.564
there was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet .	373.726
yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for .	299.6659
the lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all americans against freedom ' s other foe .	624.8824
as cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural ' ' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world .	1063.1178
the useful suggestion of professor david hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments .	2332.2007
one wonders about its applicability to people .	1255.2019
will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ?	1485.088
the answer is , of course , yes .	117.21221
for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .	343.35593
social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of archimedes .	922.5488
but it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .	345.14944
we have ample light when the sun sets	602.03595
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons	412.1265
we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down	9109.49
the range of our voice ignores distance .	5442.063
at what stage are social sciences then ? ?	617.18805
is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of newton ? ?	913.4454
there is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in copernicus and in freud .	983.03436
and it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .	530.5124
political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man .	783.9238
consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .	1236.9722
most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .	404.862
the most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .	1392.4725
just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .	616.40924
we are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .	186.59438
in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .	412.02
i want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .	335.35266
there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .	620.6436
lucretius has remarked `` the reason why all mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of god ' ' .	433.92227
perhaps things were even worse then .	745.2313
it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .	1072.2487
we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was .	524.0573
we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .	1091.3223
the bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .	1084.8208
we are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may `` push the button ' ' .	358.41345
i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly .	833.22736
they are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .	832.95844
they include both individual fears and collective ones .	646.3697
they arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .	259.1466
often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .	874.6516
yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .	608.6811
to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .	3893.338
but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .	334.41437
the frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .	1265.8274
it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .	948.7682
this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions .	1170.4377
this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .	871.03723
in fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .	314.6493
there is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .	7485.8057
a meteor could fall on san francisco .	586.6292
solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .	3598.432
our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing .	1054.0618
yet we no longer feel uneasy .	2821.5972
this almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .	510.49683
we , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .	252.48515
and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave .	573.57196
what elements of our behavior are decisive ? ?	378.87247
our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?	755.1597
we have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .	511.71075
i think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city .	304.1914
if an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .	187.33128
with the group of boys it is different .	213.09981
he does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .	273.7113
when confronted with a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .	391.14676
i believe that what i do has some effect on his actions and i have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics .	480.98386
i am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose .	2528.4998
our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .	700.37787
we are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .	832.6106
our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them .	1877.5786
we use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust ' ' , `` cheat ' ' , and `` get tough ' ' .	115.12323
we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles .	913.62085
we perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .	942.79895
small wonder , then , that we fear .	254.44008
the achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .	1355.4268
what additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? ?	591.7664
in the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics .	1170.8647
in the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio- and physiological chemistry .	328.7226
the major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .	465.95975
in addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .	511.68494
even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated .	641.37695
apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .	880.867
how and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .	838.8955
in some areas , the progress is slower than in others .	264.98856
in agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .	844.48584
in child care , the opposite extreme prevails	2542.241
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .	9519.971
there are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .	617.7398
much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .	3076.0767
the persistent horror of having a malformed child has , i believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .	414.01663
in fact , the recent warnings about the use of x-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .	1299.6123
in fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty .	1081.7839
perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .	262.49634
the situation with regard to our attitude and `` control ' ' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people .	527.997
the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear i have tried to describe .	276.78644
nothing like godot , he arrived before the hour .	170.8146
his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday , and i came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .	712.444
my wish to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .	736.54987
american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .	5619.789
they find deep pessimism in them .	38.608856
even so astute a commentator as harold clurman of the nation has said that `` waiting for godot ' ' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair ' ' .	462.00568
but to me beckett ' s writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .	734.41547
could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? ?	586.67706
is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? ?	534.84155
or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? ?	562.8499
i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .	208.35838
my curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation i had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near paris .	493.64706
when beckett ' s name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that beckett `` hates life ' ' .	445.39365
that , i thought , is at least one thing i can find out when we meet .	219.22897
the features of his face are distinct , but not fine .	368.6583
they look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .	1650.5283
unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .	598.865
one might say it combines the man	850.2364
for he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .	581.17267
his light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking .	526.5893
he seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .	221.20361
the mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .	1070.6792
the voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage .	1372.2899
the irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the french .	685.4735
his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .	3022.8232
he wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .	4740.635
we walked down the rue de l ' arcade , thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .	1904.0758
the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering .	556.1594
for one thing , the world that beckett sees is already shattered .	1294.4574
his talk turns to what he calls `` the mess ' ' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion ' ' .	268.17007
i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .	1055.9141
what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .	424.7648
`` the confusion is not my invention .	659.74146
we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion .	428.63492
it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .	320.51114
the only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess .	738.1154
it is not a mess you can make sense of ' ' .	108.43497
i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but beckett did not take to the word truth .	447.29108
`` what is more true than anything else ? ?	465.99463
to swim is true , and to sink is true .	228.03294
one is not more true than the other .	251.92282
one cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess .	156.6516
when heidegger and sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , i don ' t know , but their language is too philosophical for me .	147.26074
one can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess ' ' .	94.21792
then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .	217.80553
until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things .	2484.7168
it has held them at bay .	815.0403
it realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .	768.29596
`` how could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be ' ' ? ?	251.50488
but now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment .	314.23636
it is there and it must be allowed in ' ' .	56.954735
i granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .	240.03401
how , i asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ?	471.65915
would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ?	115.90483
if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .	842.3733
beckett ' s own work is an example .	212.57613
plays more highly formalized than `` waiting for godot ' ' , `` endgame ' ' , and `` krapp ' s last tape ' ' would be hard to find .	179.901
`` what i am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art .	639.35516
it only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else .	208.72322
the form and the chaos remain separate .	3421.8467
the latter is not reduced to the former .	249.5798
that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates .	694.6561
to find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now ' ' .	156.0257
yet , i responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? ?	192.4084
is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ? ?	603.1068
what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? ?	337.24506
`` not this ' ' , he said , and gestured toward the madeleine .	140.8409
the classical lines of the church which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory , dominated all the scene where we sat .	622.6546
the boulevard de la madeleine , the boulevard malesherbes , and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the age of reason .	1787.0121
this does not allow the mystery to invade us .	419.65884
with classical art , all is settled .	408.88266
but it is different at chartres .	1882.3307
there is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer ' ' .	139.00995
i asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .	174.02885
didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide	1379.9027
hamm ' s world is death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside .	710.8477
is this life-death question a part of the chaos ? ?	101.203186
if life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability .	372.35757
if there were only darkness , all would be clear .	192.40758
it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable .	741.7715
take augustine ' s doctrine of grace given and grace withheld have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ? ?	909.95233
two thieves are crucified with christ , one saved and the other damned .	395.63596
how can we make sense of this division ? ?	134.29402
in classical drama , such problems do not arise .	219.0695
the destiny of racine ' s phedre is sealed from the beginning she will proceed into the dark .	246.79729
as she goes , she herself will be illuminated .	689.0088
at the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark .	310.54727
within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there is not such clarity .	671.4753
the question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation .	353.94858
but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable .	647.8823
the key word in my plays is ' perhaps ' ' ' .	696.6085
given a theological lead , i asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays .	276.15784
`` well , really there is none at all .	199.44356
once i had a religious emotion .	624.01526
it was at my first communion .	552.6276
he knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .	443.8684
the family was protestant , but for me it was only irksome and i let it go .	379.75293
my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died .	991.4854
at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .	711.7899
irish catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper .	133.09438
when you pass a church on an irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross .	416.6761
one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs ' ' .	207.09824
but do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ? ?	738.0806
`` yes , for they deal with distress .	1002.6151
some people object to this in my writing .	217.27246
at a party an english intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why i write always about distress .	2877.5334
as if it were perverse to do so ! !	680.8712
he wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood .	876.8736
i told him no , that i had had a very happy childhood .	136.00946
then he thought me more perverse than ever .	1564.8519
i left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi .	570.1019
on the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees .	488.7029
one does not have to look for distress .	199.57417
it is screaming at you even in the taxis of london ' ' .	217.50519
lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming at us .	242.42053
the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar to qualities i had found in the plays .	378.65353
he says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .	3178.647
`` perhaps ' ' stands in place of commitment .	852.3338
at the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .	264.57657
if there were only the mess , all would be clear	230.26677
as a christian , i know i do not stand where beckett stands , but i do see much of what he sees .	194.35358
as a writer on the theater , i have paid close attention to the plays .	144.12015
harold clurman is right to say that `` waiting for godot ' ' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of europe ' s present politics , ethic , and common way of life ' ' .	249.56708
yet it is not only europe the play refers to .	970.2275
`` waiting for godot ' ' sells even better in america than in france .	166.37059
the consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to europe than to america , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature ' ' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture .	600.51666
america is now joining europe in this `` mature ' ' phase of development .	147.51169
whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of asia and africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .	404.33762
even hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never maintained that sex was all .	719.02325
hemingway ' s fiction is supported by a `` moral ' ' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .	686.1518
and d . h . lawrence , in fantasia of the unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .	981.3174
though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex .	387.844
`` all is not sex ' ' , declared lawrence .	221.51373
man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .	427.5314
the creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self .	370.06818
but for the beat generation all is sex .	580.1053
nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex .	227.13277
for the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct .	381.92645
he has elevated sex -- not eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead	2664.5593
it is astarte , ishtar , venus , yahwe , dionysus , christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe .	1364.5406
jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse .	1130.026
lawrence lipton , in the holy barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure	663.4255
it is a mystique , and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse .	1061.173
the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place .	497.99088
the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire .	1150.7056
for this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy .	865.3953
the beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates .	739.1696
it is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy .	1023.6597
they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .	1390.5027
unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of `` necking ' ' and `` petting ' ' .	427.65457
that is reserved for the squares .	92.25365
if they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo	1115.7467
as lipton , the prophet of the beat generation , declares `` in the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power .	461.98322
this is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat ' ' .	509.65527
this is the holy grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond .	2432.8154
if wilhelm reich is the moses who has led them out of the egypt of sexual slavery , dylan thomas is the poet who offers them the dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz .	700.21155
in addition , they have been converted to zen buddhism , with its glorification of all that is `` natural ' ' and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing .	395.52655
thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious ' ' metaphors they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .	635.16583
what they are after is the beatific vision .	1485.9918
and zen buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release .	1013.8185
the style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience .	455.34814
jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect .	1544.4298
jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm	273.55014
indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value .	779.41754
that is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it .	893.9318
instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction .	2777.026
thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being .	345.60693
jazz , like sex , is a mystique .	152.71086
it is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man .	705.8872
the mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living .	328.02
those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination .	680.10443
righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats	1578.1302
let them learn to `` swing ' ' freely , to let go , to become authentically themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved .	415.39886
the beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present .	817.45074
if he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil .	500.44965
he will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth .	1176.5134
that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians	965.52924
they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in .	449.2561
apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .	488.26266
their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation .	934.6903
the mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life	293.49356
they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious .	306.8769
with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .	277.30258
their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .	2197.395
their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent .	1261.7218
and the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing , painting , music .	961.0549
when they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation .	1679.1718
it is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed .	407.56677
what they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the muse .	2082.3643
monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability .	1151.9204
one girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion .	915.157
if it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ?	814.4226
`` most often ' ' , she says , `` it ' s the monogamous relationship that is dishonest ' ' .	104.084854
there is nothing holy in wedlock .	311.10364
this girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life .	3836.7622
she finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous .	16043.9375
this confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences .	573.6007
in the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme .	8670.307
hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex	1777.4261
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .	1840.2466
one beat poet composes a poem , `` lines on a tijuana john ' ' , which contains a few happy hints for survival .	478.6207
the new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity .	560.0592
the professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .	948.0329
who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ?	128.51997
nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .	1693.4072
they embrace independent poverty , usually with a `` shack-up ' ' partner who will help support them .	336.07785
they are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .	1204.4751
their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void .	499.89276
they feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police .	2984.989
this is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these `` religious ' ' heights .	601.1622
one beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up .	1055.1953
what obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ? ?	515.8007
sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth .	230.60158
everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism .	1887.2242
in his chapter on `` the loveways of the beat generation ' ' , lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details .	940.757
no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in west venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group .	429.1523
the women who come to west venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move .	583.4657
others who are attracted to this mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums .	3473.3867
those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .	1991.6196
since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated .	218.59785
part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .	217.81332
as lipton puts it `` the eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms .	632.14246
the magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm ' ' .	110.315384
under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being .	1018.00244
carried high on this `` charge ' ' , he composes `` magical ' ' poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words .	474.38794
if he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work -- allen ginsberg ' s `` howl ' ' is a striking example of this tendency -- that is disoriented , dionysian but without depth and without apollonian control .	1327.7648
for drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity .	974.8003
how is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses .	453.1425
if love reflects the nature of man , as ortega y gasset believes , if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre .	611.94104
there were fences in the old days when we were children .	142.71849
across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles .	652.4288
alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one ' s head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .	647.49414
front fences were covered with virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle .	10259.526
square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage	17946.916
they were topped by steeples complete in every detail high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable .	9052.981
on these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang .	9635.791
the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree .	862.3327
the primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us .	349.04047
what one actually remembers is its greenness .	2518.4548
from high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible .	621.5448
one looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .	893.48224
every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees .	782.041
in the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub , snowball , rose-of-sharon and balm-of-gilead .	17061.623
from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea a neighbor ' s gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .	1449.6943
that was one epoch the apple-tree epoch .	12667.386
another had ended before it began .	171.86298
time is a queer thing and memory a queerer	3430.8945
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .	930.25195
from maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .	424.29254
in a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water	921.5798
the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it .	428.37726
time in the sum is nothing .	245.5153
and yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one ' s being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .	281.29965
the part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` it could have been like that for only a little while ' '	499.14438
but true memory does not count nor add it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time .	792.60156
once , then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences , when i was too small to reach the apple tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up .	847.5203
that world was in scale with my own smallness .	9654.528
i have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that i could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of november	1224.1448
ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes	2773.7966
hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it .	738.3626
it was mother who planted the verbenas .	2273.2466
i think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .	2321.4495
my great-grandmother , i have been told , made her garden her great pride	561.5706
she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar	3939.9111
she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house .	838.77795
these my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .	1216.9205
three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink	1551.6638
the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them	1341.4598
i have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .	2426.5535
other flowers we might gather as we pleased myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs	8226.169
the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach	2246.4497
hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink-petticoated ladies	20141.33
and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere .	10831.332
more potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .	311.2952
flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead .	316.52777
pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite	1222.6321
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch	5113.632
red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them	1060.0942
morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag	4745.099
bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made `` gloves ' ' on the ends of ten waggling fingers .	1674.0248
fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to `` spit tobacco , spit ' ' .	1270.8575
dead fledgling birds , their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags .	752.7786
and the cast shell of a locust , straw-colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back .	3000.4583
every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade .	1055.6603
we collected `` lucky stones ' ' -- all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway .	512.9039
when these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated .	2837.8755
we showed them to each other and said `` would you have guessed ' ' ? ?	188.58444
squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by .	784.11084
even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the sleeping beauty ' s enchanted castle , or when rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside .	1351.2573
we enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school .	373.3128
in the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone	1262.3542
our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch .	898.3485
they never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` don ' t go outside the gate ' ' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation .	371.86133
we were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .	388.11743
we were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .	785.3078
the street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an august afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .	744.98083
every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it .	1512.7578
a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves .	1051.672
a wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again .	944.9377
if a child watched its progress he whispered , `` hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away ' ' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses ' feet returned no more .	668.3273
when the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster ' s cart might turn the corner .	431.67712
the horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees .	2034.9121
sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice `` rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today ' ' ! !	2158.2551
the lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .	2182.6082
no one seemed to hear him , no one heeded .	1057.9626
the horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .	251.3373
it became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .	197.78987
after his passage , the street was empty again .	402.52338
the sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down	334.56558
the trees ' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn .	4075.0576
at four-o ' clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day	284.11612
he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing .	569.35266
the streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer	1968.0853
they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday .	613.98944
but the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides .	572.6944
the curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees .	664.0857
opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .	2196.5757
the street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center	3479.9749
it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones .	952.6242
it had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .	279.732
the hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses .	656.2152
cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys ' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .	1002.84656
it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for mann ' s work .	570.35345
the wife , amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous ' ' and `` indolent ' ' , possibly `` a mischief maker ' ' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning ' ' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` birdlike brain ' ' .	517.32806
lautner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves ' ' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs ' ' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order ' ' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled `` they will be destroyed ' ' .	318.18024
the trick these two play upon jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .	1642.9148
his appearance as lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience	4034.6438
it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .	2457.2307
at the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like jacoby ' s , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life .	1113.8596
the music which lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal ' ' .	513.5908
but it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice ' ' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art ' ' .	367.2664
and this occurs now , at the refrain of jacoby ' s song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` lizzy ' ' --	112.26471
a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius ' ' .	252.23451
`` a miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude ' ' .	351.45044
it is this modulation which reveals to jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife ' s infidelity .	1157.6896
by the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience	1151.6842
in the work of every artist , i suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about	600.00037
not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment .	1129.9979
the horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby	1753.4521
the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering ' ' )	720.3438
the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself	768.0403
beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of mann ' s work .	413.06833
when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , i come up with the following ideas , which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .	374.04407
love is the crucial dilemma of experience for mann ' s heroes .	211.60948
the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .	1169.0199
the release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible	2309.927
and the motion toward it brings disaster .	1086.1138
this prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art	2439.0144
it is particularly the artist ( tonio kroger , aschenbach , leverkuhn ) who suffers from it .	2215.014
the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough ' ' in the realm of art .	87.233284
again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .	836.9745
finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of mann ' s stories .	1729.982
we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .	812.23645
for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody .	464.8592
professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .	640.40295
that this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art	374.28546
that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in mann ' s stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between jacoby and lautner .	640.7396
it appears that the dominant tendency of mann ' s early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .	663.06525
in a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same .	169.60188
something of this can be learned from `` the way to the churchyard ' ' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .	443.69043
there is no more `` plot ' ' than that	74.608536
only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give .	461.61084
the artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness .	285.56207
the first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent `` the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end	1474.1993
that is to say , to the churchyard ' ' .	60.605595
and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction .	551.14417
the highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .	321.38608
but that is too simple , and won ' t hold up .	114.24581
as the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end .	530.74133
but the highroad , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death .	360.48514
thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang ' ' , while on the footpath one man walks alone .	984.6017
this man ' s isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent .	665.96423
he is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth	279.91226
also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account .	392.21957
his name is praisegod piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author ' s repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` death in venice ' ' , for example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp .	619.71564
this strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .	508.64386
the cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` life ' ' -- that and a license number , which piepsam uses in addressing him .	815.4232
`` life ' ' points out that `` everybody uses this path ' ' , and starts to ride on .	390.9633
piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` life ' ' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather .	404.04602
his rage assumes a religious form	2328.264
that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecates doom on life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well `` all you light-headed breed ' ' .	621.1608
this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .	634.8073
then an ambulance comes along , and they drive praisegod piepsam away .	1765.4165
this is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .	315.84027
the season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect .	420.76028
piepsam ' s fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because god will not stop him	577.69635
as piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments `` his justice is not of this world ' ' .	174.95183
life is further characterized , in antithesis to piepsam , as animal the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle a dog in a wagon is `` admirable ' ' , `` a pleasure to contemplate ' '	444.71198
another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid of interest ' ' .	158.5098
piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur ' ' and `` puppy ' ' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face .	541.77527
the ambulance is drawn by two `` charming ' ' little horses .	256.483
piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense .	249.5962
his religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness	1630.1893
the two may in fact be identical .	572.0451
his unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings	3841.4636
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe praisegod piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated ' ' .	821.22986
the cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic life , `` blithe and carefree ' ' .	1628.9143
`` he made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth ' ' .	132.74419
piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody	12048.268
his end is ridiculous and trivial .	512.69507
he is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard ' ' .	404.7676
but he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than life considered as a cyclist .	284.67416
and if i have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in mann ' s writing the crude sketch of piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , naphta and leverkuhn .	778.7489
in method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism ' ' , anticipates a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as leverkuhn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic ' ' .	690.9417
it resembles , too , pictures such as durer and bruegel did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for example , or a deadly sin .	901.4307
`` gladius dei ' ' ( 1902 ) resembles `` the way to the churchyard ' ' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` life ' ' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .	333.75565
the monk savonarola , brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background of munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of m . bluthenzweig	697.9425
in particular against a madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter ' s mistress .	1274.2227
hieronymus , like piepsam , makes his protest quite in vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating	1093.862
he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter .	130.3531
on the street outside , hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in florence , and prophetically he issues his curse `` gladius dei super terram cito et velociter ' ' .	1401.0571
the `` reality ' ' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world .	802.0412
their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason .	539.0803
these polar concerns ( imitation vs . formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time .	737.2878
the breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes .	1299.7803
thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers .	2201.5588
the image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery .	952.35803
the image of god has simply disappeared .	822.5557
all such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality ' ' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved .	683.6772
the person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .	788.4058
whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .	462.87317
without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being .	447.82587
and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .	436.04727
for better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation ' ' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism .	404.1753
a broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist ' s creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises .	1309.8809
on the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .	626.78033
we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .	1083.9889
accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which i shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which i shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) .	488.94815
the word `` mimesis ' ' ( `` imitation ' ' ) is usually associated with plato and aristotle .	140.07784
for plato , `` imitation ' ' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence .	472.49545
all artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations ' ' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic ' ' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect .	361.96317
in plato ' s judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers .	269.7104
presupposed in plato ' s system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .	412.067
aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .	757.7518
the poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation ' ' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did plato .	1061.5323
but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .	1223.1558
for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality .	633.4206
the central concern of erich auerbach ' s impressive volume called mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .	673.28094
following the theme of incarnation in the gospels , the christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures ' ' of divine power and reality .	468.91483
here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .	1177.1813
artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama .	1293.0045
the artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .	1193.3934
he is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .	241.52968
i have chosen to use the word `` mimesis ' ' in its christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .	360.84784
in the first instance , `` mimesis ' ' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations .	746.9739
by `` image ' ' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith .	664.9412
this is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .	514.488
mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .	1317.7412
the images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately	1100.3038
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .	1500.3944
they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality .	992.1783
as in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images .	959.4783
mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .	494.3469
a word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene ' ' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings .	1205.9531
similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field .	1151.598
a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .	564.81824
the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials .	542.47064
when words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .	1152.1836
these are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .	572.86566
the presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood .	780.6394
underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .	2486.6406
experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect .	1406.1825
neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs .	1244.703
primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc . ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities .	680.9446
in contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .	797.861
the most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself	920.43445
a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part .	400.74915
these desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one ' s good , others threatening ill .	731.4957
gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .	1603.5792
in its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one ' s life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .	1098.7766
the principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy ' ' is alfred north whitehead .	581.7968
our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .	447.9978
we feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening .	1290.7191
later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience .	458.70462
it takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one ' s world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .	636.08075
whitehead is here questioning david hume ' s understanding of the nature of experience	274.54773
he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from hume ' s presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived .	1383.8604
what hume calls `` sensation ' ' is what whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy ' ' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .	609.0318
as long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .	781.4185
whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world .	588.9104
in this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct .	469.54535
a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .	512.0249
both i and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which i now am .	899.9353
after only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree ' ' , to be sure .	286.89117
there were more indications by the mid-twentieth century .	228.254
i leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but i noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from memphis to hattiesburg .	682.74384
in town after town my companion pointed out the negro school and the white school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .	371.60995
it really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by booker t . washington had been going on .	473.79633
but with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .	606.8805
for over a hundred years southerners have felt that the north was picking on them .	878.40533
it ' s infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .	604.8123
by what right of superior virtue , southerners ask , do the people of the north do this ? ?	375.84732
the traditional strategy of the south has been to expose the vices of the north , to demonstrate that the north possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that ' ' as james ' s christopher newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad i may be , you ' re not quite the people to say it ' ' .	224.40343
in the pre-civil war years , the south argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the north .	775.52234
at the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there ' s no more of the true spirit of `` integration ' ' in the north than in the south .	160.92291
the line is a pretty good one .	598.066
people talk about `` the law of the land ' ' .	31.537252
the expression has become quite a cliche .	661.52094
but people can ' t be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by southern standards ) by law .	782.96643
i was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to n . v . peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the european middle ages , one in american history , and one in the far east ) , and i asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy ' ' ( francis thompson ' s words for the hound of heaven ' s pursuit ) by judicial fiat .	535.16144
they didn ' t seem to be able to think of any .	63.869698
a virginia judge a while back cited a roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .	501.71408
but i suspect that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which tacitus was talking about when he said , `` they make a desert , and call it peace ' ' ( `` solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant ' ' .	770.61005
moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable	435.40524
it has been , many times .	240.37245
mr . justice taney ' s dred scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the north , and soon became a dead letter .	1069.0676
prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated northeast ! !	763.4488
the cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .	478.70493
the declaration of independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed ' ' .	726.8792
the phrase `` consent of the governed ' ' needs a hard look .	457.08652
how do we define it ' ' ? ?	9.659578
is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ?	302.49457
calhoun dealt with this question in his `` disquisition on government ' ' .	265.32715
to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority ' ' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation ' ' .	266.77606
who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ?	443.6716
that regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ?	97.080635
that the court order does not unequally affect the southern region ? ?	789.6165
who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action is incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed ' ' ? ?	204.83331
a friend of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .	1060.9028
he seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .	630.06995
i murmured something about a possible difference between new mexico ' s history and mississippi ' s .	174.77565
one can meet with aloofness almost anywhere the thidiu viewpoint , it doesn ' t affect us ! !	969.28973
southern liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they ' re rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .	1081.476
the trouble here is that it ' s almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn ' t cost you anything .	337.37085
you ' ve already sent your daughter to miss x ' s select academy for girls and your son to mr . y ' s select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .	499.8768
if there ' s no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there ' s always new england .	520.33246
new england academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , south as well as west .	857.9507
they may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from thailand , or any place other than the american south .	485.95877
it would be interesting to know how much `` integration ' ' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of new england .	627.2246
a recent newspaper report said there were five negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at yale	1240.828
that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish ' ' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national ' ' .	625.8509
i must confess that i prefer the liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .	285.76437
i leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are .	175.2124
i ' m talking about the grand manner of the liberal -- north and south -- who is not affected personally .	766.27893
if these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ?	269.91763
) , what voices would be left ? ?	79.21814
who is involved willy nilly ? ?	1357.2675
well , after everybody has followed the new england pattern of segregating one ' s children into private schools , only the poor folks are left .	720.1817
and it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .	440.22772
a dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the south and has spent many years in new england , said to me not long ago `` i can ' t forgive new england for rejecting all complicity ' ' .	345.72794
being a teacher of american literature , i remembered whittier ' s `` massachusetts to virginia ' ' , where he said `` but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown ' ' .	1122.9731
there is a legend ( hawthorne records it in his `` english notebooks ' ' .	289.8992
and one finds it again in thomas nelson page ) to the effect that the mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of negro slaves .	783.286
whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .	268.68503
it is something which most of us try to get out from under .	421.0256
like the cowboy in stephen crane ' s `` blue hotel ' ' , we run around crying , `` well , i didn ' t do anything , did i ' ' ? ?	151.11983
robert penn warren puts it this way in `` brother to dragons ' ' `` the recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence ' ' , where innocence , i think , means about the same thing as redemption .	438.144
a man must be able to say , `` father , i have sinned ' ' , or there is no hope for him .	117.07815
lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` second inaugural ' ' that god `` gives to both north and south this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came ' ' .	346.1045
he also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman ' s two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil ' ' .	1085.2817
lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of new englanders engaged in the slave trade .	427.56525
after how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ? ?	2016.5015
it is a question which new englanders long ago put out of their minds .	1334.6705
but didn ' t they get off too easy ? ?	210.59732
the slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave-owners they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth	331.80194
they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care .	1674.812
emerson -- platonist , idealist , doctrinaire -- sounded a high transcendental note in his `` boston hymn ' ' , delivered in 1863 in the boston music hall amidst thundering applause `` pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim .	2000.2166
the slave is owner , and ever was .	114.81574
it is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist .	546.2115
it ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) .	1061.2574
like pilate , they had washed their hands .	366.85577

can god be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ?	107.423485
new englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration of independence , as jefferson explained in his `` autobiography ' ' ``	228.79044
the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of africa was struck out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .	664.9485
our northern brethren also i believe felt a little tender under those censures	2645.9614
for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others ' ' .	346.62375
but that was a long time ago .	487.01425
the new england conscience became desensitized .	10944.22
george w . cable ( naturalized new englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` paradise road , northampton ' ' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` southern question ' ' .	860.5938
it was nice to be able to isolate it .	114.09914
new england , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the nation .	604.84375
there one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the united states .	320.42465
why should this be so ? ?	127.489426
it is true that new england , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start .	302.5279
but i think that something more than this is involved .	423.75024
how did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of american democracy , failed to flourish in new england as it did in other parts of the country ? ?	177.85095
isn ' t it a bit odd that the three states of southern new england ( massachusetts , connecticut , and rhode island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been a & m colleges ? ?	649.76776
was it supposed , perchance , that a & m ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the new england world in the post-civil war period , the immigrants having been brought in from southern europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the west ? ?	611.30994
is it not ironical that roger williams ' s state , rhode island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? ?	437.79962
the state universities of maine , new hampshire , and vermont are older and more `` respectable ' '	354.5783
they had less immigration to contend with .	461.59653
a yale historian , writing a few years ago in the yale review , said `` we in new england have long since segregated our children ' ' .	403.4546
he was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .	413.63776
and what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! !	1322.9852
i don ' t propose to go into their history , but i have one or two surmises .	319.53662
one is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children .	807.5304
in the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory .	280.5225
among the recipients of the nobel prize for literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of english .	932.9897
of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than verner von heidenstam , the swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .	1353.3595
equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of sweden in the past and continues it into the present .	429.38116
in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .	425.53598
heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .	610.45966
on his father ' s side he was of german descent , on his mother ' s he came of the old swedish nobility .	247.07341
the family estate was situated near vadstena on lake vattern in south central sweden .	6770.348
it is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .	1153.6306
as a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of sweden ' s ancient glory .	536.63153
he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .	222.78168
being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in italy , then in greece , egypt , asia minor , and palestine .	409.12003
in one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .	532.71014
deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of gerome in paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .	293.42276
he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` the happy artists ' ' .	182.06961
`` i scanned the world through printed symbol swart , and through the beggar ' s rags i strove to see the inner man .	1122.3479
i looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart ' ' .	219.36763
in this final line , we have the key to his nature .	77.84945
few writers have better understood their deepest selves .	4522.1953
heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface .	330.94284
it may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in paris .	333.06946
the first result of heidenstam ' s long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , pilgrimage and wander-years ( vallfart och vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .	614.61304
it was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did byron ' s childe harold .	755.5015
professor fredrik book , sweden ' s foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows `` in this we have the verse of a painter	423.0029
strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .	816.4036
in a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic	1201.3639
all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively .	2159.9292
the young poet-painter reproduces the french life of the streets	162.02087
he tells stories of the thousand and one nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of damascus .	1367.792
in the care-free indolence of the east he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it .	189.4897
and yet amid all the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years is a cycle of short poems , `` thoughts in loneliness ' ' , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing ' ' .	756.1802
of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` nameless and immortal ' ' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the swedish language .	704.1941
it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of neptune at paestum , next to the parthenon the noblest example of grecian classic style now in existence .	1753.8058
on the eve of his return to their native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .	809.0385
the supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .	447.00958
not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .	698.89667
`` the man ' s true reputation is his work ' ' .	93.23315
the short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` thoughts in loneliness ' ' is , as professor book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .	272.05487
it consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as `` the spark ' ' `` there is a spark dwells deep within my soul .	608.78937
to get it out into the daylight ' s glow is my life ' s aim both first and last , the whole .	250.05367
it slips away , it burns and tortures me .	2009.9314
that little spark is all the wealth i know , that little spark is my life ' s misery ' ' .	265.79163
a dominant motive is the poet ' s longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations `` not men-folk , but the fields where i would stray , the stones where as a child i used to play ' ' .	355.68036
he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .	403.52826
what he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause ' ' to which he can honestly devote himself .	390.4921
this restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in sweden .	298.07318
his cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .	444.25842
he did not , however , find himself at once .	216.62982
his next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled hans alienus , which professor book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .	1028.7537
the hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the east , a sort of faustus type , who , to quote from professor book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .	470.10004
he is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of tiveden ' ' .	344.44183
from this time on heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .	1439.0714
by the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions .	619.9042
he did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .	645.81665
like his friend and contemporary august strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .	4742.9775
he saw sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .	989.05927
strindberg ' s remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .	708.4962
heidenstam ' s conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .	116.10552
whether in prose or poetry , all of heidenstam ' s later work was concerned with sweden .	335.88107
with the first of a group of historical novels , the charles men ( karolinerna ) , published in 1897-8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career .	497.67062
in scope and power it can only be compared to tolstoy ' s war and peace .	175.47066
about one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .	744.67365
though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself .	558.8854
hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king	163.75502
on the fatal battlefield of poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people ' ' .	504.56262
the charles men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .	467.12634
somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .	321.33353
they comprise a great variety of scene and interest grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters .	2993.7097
almost nothing is said of charles ' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat .	920.22205
to carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .	784.53564
his peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .	303.6824
george meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .	798.898
of few authors is this more true than of heidenstam .	547.982
the charles men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .	510.86066
the career of charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of napoleon .	1021.4982
his ideal was alexander of macedon , as napoleon ' s was julius caesar .	1264.7926
his purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .	253.68823
each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .	144.64243
each failed catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .	563.1654
each is still glorified as a national hero .	247.17264
the first half of the charles men , ending on the climax of the battle of poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .	623.4502
after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .	1428.8109
like napoleon , he was the worst of losers .	865.0393
there are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the swedes in adversity .	206.48245
then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .	4249.623
this comes out in `` when the bells ring ' ' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the danes .	730.6876
in `` the king ' s ride ' ' , charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .	848.2287
he finds it in utter misery and desolation .	4018.3127
all his people ask for is no more war .	243.34128
but he plunges into yet another , this time with norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .	658.32733
he had become king at fifteen .	784.13214
then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .	1071.3839
from being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of sweden .	428.06952
this is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , `` a hero ' s funeral ' ' , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem .	175.45761
slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .	1320.1173
the guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .	641.01404
as he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .	145.44719
heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in swedish memory .	2598.154
excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of the charles men , and need not detain us here .	384.17676
it is different with his volume the swedes and their chieftains ( svenskarna och deras hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .	701.5972
admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to swedish history for readers of other countries .	473.01575
some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .	578.23926
especially touching is the chapter , `` the little sister ' ' , about a king ' s daughter who became a nun in the convent of st . birgitta .	240.36581
the record teems with romance and adventure .	1503.1873
gustaf vasa is a superb example , and charles 10 , , the conqueror of denmark , hardly less so .	797.4518
of gustavus adolphus and charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak .	347.7694
today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .	681.8833
it is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited .	3262.3477
the mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways .	586.8844
on the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .	242.70912
as a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client .	331.4528
for this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine .	658.6259
on the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases	1435.1167
no client would ever think of asking him to do such things .	424.4781
whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder .	691.42255
operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .	499.59512
he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .	556.7049
thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman .	324.10742
he is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society .	439.95386
it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective .	529.4197
by virtue of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost .	953.81
at the same time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man .	552.2591
in this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds .	528.0645
he is an individualist but not an anarchist	5772.7617
he is a public servant but not a cop .	1160.203
in short , the fictional private eye is a specialized version of adam smith ' s ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare .	1501.0548
in the mystery story , as in the wealth of nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin .	291.622
there is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement adam smith was wrong .	5109.021
not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism .	737.9501
the rise of the giant corporations in western europe and the united states dates from the period 1880-1900 .	692.656
now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as balzac , dickens , and poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction .	724.05853
sherlock holmes , the ancestor of all private eyes , was born during the 1890s .	972.48267
thus the transformation of adam smith ' s ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life .	669.02295
driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private detective .	455.9278
the birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal .	632.8784
even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved .	450.28702
the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct he enforces the law without being told to do so .	730.22614
the private eye is therefore a moral man	966.63574
but his morality rests upon that of his society .	106.25917
the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal .	496.80215
unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good .	218.27484
as capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma .	409.5637
if he is good , he may not be legal	70.96596
if he is legal , he may not be good .	40.95506
it is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story .	875.80426
with the advent of sir arthur conan doyle ' s sherlock holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins .	580.2835
sherlock holmes is not merely an individualist	8319.731
he is very close to being a mental case .	241.57068
a brief list of the great detective ' s little idiosyncrasies would provide dr . freud with ample food for thought .	521.6444
holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants	4048.8516
he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln	9940.792
he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist .	4205.3765
holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds .	1083.1746
his eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .	1506.8221
it was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes became a detective in the first place .	681.4734
as he informs watson , `` my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence .	290.60547
these little problems help me to do so ' ' .	54.680557
holmes is a public servant , to be sure	212.74434
but the society which he serves bores him to tears .	1625.5964
the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior .	866.91815
although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland yard , holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police .	656.61896
they for their part are convinced that holmes is too `` unorthodox ' ' and `` theoretical ' ' to make a good detective .	256.82788
why do the police find holmes `` unorthodox ' ' ? ?	295.35303
on the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine .	3153.1526
another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by watson when he observes on several occasions that holmes would have made a magnificent criminal .	987.0197
watson ' s insight is verified by the mysterious link between holmes and his arch-opponent , dr . moriarty .	913.6562
the two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness .	1373.8384
the first series of sherlock holmes adventures ends with holmes and moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff .	2995.072
they are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace .	1266.5477
linked to holmes even in death , moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .	459.40552
just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the detective , so holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both .	2288.3408
in the modern english `` whodunnit ' ' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared .	1038.1119
hercule poirot and lord peter whimsey ( the respective creations of agatha christie and dorothy sayers ) have retained holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits .	3965.2307
poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people	3342.7454
it is true that they are also extremely dull .	477.00168
their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a sherlock holmes .	659.33386
the latter ' s real descendents were unable to take root in england	959.26514
they fled from the victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy atlantic .	1287.0887
in the american `` hardboiled ' ' detective story of the ' 20s and ' 30s , the spirit of the mad genius from baker street lives on .	517.6869
like holmes , the american private eye rejects the social conventions of his time .	548.2504
but unlike holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt .	522.1598
surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled ' ' private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation .	868.69086
his alienation is far more acute than holmes '	1398.3005
he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast .	7263.7856
with rex stout ' s nero wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane .	768.5364
wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .	1077.6698
more profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of raymond chandler ' s philip marlowe .	748.0614
in a society where everything is for sale , marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought .	486.79907
his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence .	308.8596
beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals , always alone , always despised .	2220.999
in the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care	304.97873
virtue is its own and only reward .	493.13986
a similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of eric ambler and dominates the most famous of all american mystery stories , dashiell hammett ' s the maltese falcon .	3199.3945
sam spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon	2231.5242
but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake .	218.1634
now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer .	492.152
for sam spade , neither crime nor virtue pays	35855.465
moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .	371.30707
because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police .	539.1346
the latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .	1073.3398
in either case , they do not appreciate the private detective ' s zeal .	122.1854
perry mason and hamilton burger , nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal .	3121.9592
frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer	1724.089
dashiell hammett ' s red harvest provides a classic example of this theme .	771.3847
but even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye .	345.26105
he is , like phillip marlowe , too alienated to be reliable .	3073.3203
finally , in the maltese falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion sam spade becomes the chief murder suspect .	4814.2603
in order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend .	267.9607
what was only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes now appears as a direct accusation the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .	1047.7518
it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma .	773.4679
by upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption .	627.31946
that society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal .	466.71176
if the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .	578.00244
he must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .	540.84375
on the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism .	327.20923
dashiell hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits .	1936.8838
his successors have adopted the opposite alternative .	571.5211
in order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man .	519.7155
the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by mickey spillane ' s mike hammer .	924.0647
at first glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors .	494.1084
for hammer , nothing is forbidden .	412.70154
he kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge , jury and executioner rolled into one .	1245.5984
it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in table 1 .	351.94028
great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network .	249.68776
by monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers .	278.36865
as a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation .	370.0936
for example , suppose a man wearing a $200 watch , driving a 1959 rolls royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` what time is it ' ' ? ?	334.5919
this sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car .	265.69785
if the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation .	267.43326
also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command .	1241.1576
however , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to table 1 .	406.6259
on this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .	1197.0757
networks illustrating some special types of organization	477.57452
presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host ' s desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors .	756.20074
the party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another .	618.81616
the information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears .	287.51746
since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net .	335.28693
as shown in figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .	281.65012
this , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up .	1143.0989
all four types of message listed in table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged .	5099.5625
the completeness of the connections provide that , for n people , there are af lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1 , 225 ) for a party of fifty guests .	375.02954
looking at the diagram , we see that af connection lines come in to each member .	529.5093
thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness .	101.106094
in spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the af incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if n exceeds about six .	1434.6699
the crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes .	938.4769
for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers , then the `` open house ' ' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door .	897.23114
we consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence .	1638.0634
we assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in figure 2 .	434.4587
information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- , third- , and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor .	7440.4326
in figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number .	302.39233
the numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors .	365.14648
it will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers .	1029.6725
in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens .	540.1716
a point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n .	1594.4291
the dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort .	493.49033
since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp .	631.169
location theorists have given these matters much consideration .	1534.4752
the networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war .	437.31537
they also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored .	1127.7645
without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party .	5445.832
the need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling .	1587.7676
alexander the great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once .	608.01013
as time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased .	608.5453
next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value .	2111.4756
on the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in figure 3 .	232.77754
the monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence .	434.68585
no questions , statements , or explanations are permitted -- only commands .	494.44547
commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank .	430.91046
the same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal .	671.3379
all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks .	350.7138
even the officer in charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring .	498.96805
this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility .	1567.5607
the commands are specified by the military regulations	358.90256
are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound	1356.1554
and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground .	1813.6774
this monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .	468.21436
with troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication .	426.757
years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard .	921.6004
in contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal .	208.68442
in the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior .	1027.9329
a military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .	470.2758
this objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .	128.13399
the connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village .	438.31348
the assumptions upon which the example shown in figure 3 is based are ( a ) one man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc . .	600.93
( b ) a message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times .	723.51874
( c ) decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .	216.13817
and ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank .	301.5156
these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel .	287.4925
the number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55 , 987 men .	1342.1445
this organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .	404.57773
of types of message listed in table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3 .	556.6269
a further regulation is that commands always go down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go up , unaccompanied by commands .	1463.0808
questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor .	1902.0894
it will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice .	983.2533
furthermore , the network in figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced .	1049.9022
not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks .	1087.2314
such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach .	892.6893
this is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the finns in geochemistry .	551.4741
we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes .	507.86224
this problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis .	971.1541
since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it .	308.89508
first , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .	316.52023
but , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such .	555.4576
for example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only x-rays , applying only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites	970.92255
or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven andean indians .	724.8061
so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more .	508.45978
american democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the american democratic faith .	199.8287
those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 .	864.97125
and he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law .	380.269
i want to say more about gabriel ' s so-called fundamental law .	423.55914
but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it .	195.62766
he points out that from the time of jackson on through world war 1 , , evangelical protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of america .	307.1656
he terms this early enthusiasm `` romantic christianity ' ' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical protestantism ' ' .	522.5172
let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme .	304.73218
he says `` beside the protestant philosophy of progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the united states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy ' ' .	271.88876
he specifies , `` in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism , in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism .	281.77112
but in every period it has been humanism ' ' .	86.18468
and let me add , utopianism , also .	612.21106
some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay i called the leader follows -- where ? ?	349.70154
i used his polarity to illustrate what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call progressivism .	399.47775
it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .	956.0927
that is to say gabriel ' s fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more .	608.34216
it is a weakness of gabriel ' s analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy .	381.41
and with progressivism the religion of humanity was replacing what gabriel called christian supernaturalism .	1567.7946
and the common man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on his own .	981.23737
during the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the voice of god and fled from behind saint woodrow ( wilson ) only to learn from science , to his shocked relief that after all there was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much couldn ' t be expected of him .	317.15735
the socialism implicit in the slogan of the roosevelt revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution , or of the jacksonian frontier .	345.68176
what had happened to the common man ? ?	86.44822
french egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of popularism .	731.17035
the riotous onrush of industrialism after the war for southern independence and the general secular drift to the religion of humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the french revolution ' s socialistic offspring of one sort of another .	379.73557
the first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson .	559.1402
moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s , the dislocations of the depression , the common ethos of materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced mike fink and the great gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the little people .	1008.6533
however , it is important to trace the philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former .	283.35117
that john locke ' s philosophy of the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration of independence , i believe , we generally accept .	330.1192
yet , after rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the french revolution also .	220.93091
the importance of rousseau ' s twist has not always been clear to us , however .	141.4755
this notion of the general will gave rise to the commune of paris in the revolution and later brought napoleon to dictatorship .	1559.3563
and it is clearly argued by lord percy of newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , the heresy of democracy , and in a more general way by voegelin , in his new science of politics , that this same rousseauan idea , descending through european democracy , is the source of marx ' s theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat .	489.30362
this is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after world war 2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace .	745.107
the long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under a socialist state .	624.09296
and the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar .	844.2113
and by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually marxist .	1061.1993
we will recall that the still confident liberals of the truman administration gathered with other western utopians in san francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world the united nations .	592.35223
we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation .	417.2075
then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .	1064.59
during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal .	446.71298
during the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon the atom bomb .	1158.4637
in 1952 , it will be remembered , the g . o . p . without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly .	488.78192
all of this , i know , is recent history familiar to you .	397.81827
but i have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under eisenhower ' s leadership .	260.2598
a perceptive journalist , sam lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .	310.33334
he opens his discourse , however , with a review of the eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age .	546.06146
the show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .	1468.7504
lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue .	416.71597
and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation `` in essence the drama of his ( eisenhower ' s ) presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism ' ' .	737.9462
i will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism .	569.62585
it has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused .	620.10876
obviously there has been no agreement on what american conservatism is , or rather , what it should be .	196.80957
for it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began .	458.08542
i saw a piece the other day assailing william buckley , author of man and god at yale and publisher of the national review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal .	552.9023
i would agree with this view .	140.52312
but i ' m not here to define conservatism .	612.8042
what i am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course .	367.57333
one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , i suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with eisenhower conservatism .	274.34607
though , to be sure , we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment .	1190.1592
this is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise .	389.91772
but before i try to diagnose it , i would offer other evidence .	167.28893
i will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year .	503.2096
the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by life magazine , under the title of the national purpose .	380.50662
the contributors to this testament were all well-known a former democratic candidate for president , a new deal poet , the magazine ' s chief editorial writer , two newspaper columnists , head of a national broadcasting company , a popular protestant evangelist , etc . .	630.46606
what i want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception .	607.1514
i suppose we might classify billy graham as an old liberal .	2588.6145
and i would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song .	629.8044
its refrain was `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation ' ' .	494.6891
adlai stevenson expressed some reservations about this return .	541.8337
others invoked technology and common sense .	319.39465
only walter lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes ' ' .	233.7362
but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent .	1499.9178
the second specific comment was the report of eisenhower ' s commission on national goals , titled goals for americans .	327.69968
they , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that eisenhower requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly of columbia university , because it was non-partisan .	382.99313
the commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism .	810.998
and here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above `` the paramount goal of the united states set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity ' ' .	421.61606
this group is secularist and their program tends to be technological .	440.75473
but it is the need to undertake these testaments that i would submit here as symptom of the common man ' s malaise .	433.01016
and let me add murray ' s new book as another symptom of it , particularly so in view of the attention time magazine gave it when it came out recently .	486.31833
father murray goes back to the declaration of independence , too , though i may add , with considerably more historical perception .	223.1056
i will reserve discussion of it for a moment , however , to return to president kennedy .	70.31817
as symptomatic of the common man ' s malaise , he is most significant a liberal and a catholic , elected by the skin of his teeth .	224.41788
does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? ?	285.62378
what is the common man ' s complaint ? ?	81.317726
let ' s take a panoramic look back over the course we have come .	606.75604
has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under eisenhower ? ?	1015.7294
and the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic .	463.77853
ralph gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress .	224.69585
but there ' s a subjective side to that utopian outlook .	612.71423
does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ?	707.9376
here there may be an analogy with cancer we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .	1479.2975
should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ?	688.43475
noting such evidence is the first step	384.7113
and almost the only `` cure ' ' is early detection and removal .	309.9719
one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society ' s organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before .	388.4833
so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .	726.6388
in any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease ' ' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical .	343.79532
have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? ?	1176.1309
hence the prime issue , as i see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .	446.00125
we are already committed to establishing man ' s supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today .	550.9061
otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate .	446.49515
we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .	408.42377
we must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies otherwise why try anything ? ?	957.26196
so in these pages the term `` technology ' ' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man ' s control over himself and over other men .	476.45496
naturally this includes all communication forms , e . g . languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .	359.42712
properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution .	398.76123
if we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man	1092.1
but we cannot start off with a clean slate .	604.57587
so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man ' s major needs .	304.52927
asked which institution most needs correction , i would say the corporation as it exists in america today .	240.35677
at first glance this appears strange of all people , was not america founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring `` undeveloped ' ' societies abroad ? ?	807.8308
but hear harrison e . salisbury , former moscow correspondent of the new york times , and author of `` to moscow -- and beyond ' ' .	255.15422
in a book review of `` the soviet cultural offensive ' ' , he says , `` long before the state department organized its bureaucracy into an east-west contacts staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of american culture had carved its mark across the russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' porgy and bess ' overrode the state department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines .	1063.3434
they were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like henry ford , hugh cooper , thomas campbell , the international harvester co . , and david w . griffith .	2171.4778
their kind created an american culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies .	992.8787
this favorable image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-american propaganda ' '	753.61224
perhaps the public ' s present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur ' ' no more exists in america .	256.41
in his stead is a milquetoast version known as `` the corporation ' ' .	365.29767
but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america , foreigners can	395.61523
and our loss of `` prestige ' ' abroad is the direct result .	231.94545
no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts .	538.6165
if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .	136.88632
first , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership .	799.5287
businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .	420.6947
when we `` forced ' ' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what i would term `` pseudo-capitalism ' ' and so took a major step toward socialism .	540.47687
the biggest loss , of course , was the individual ' s lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .	217.1488
socialism , i grant , has a definite place in our society .	213.66856
but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic .	682.2804
some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society .	553.25464
but the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .	969.22687
its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .	429.83963
it serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .	900.3551
as a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing ' ' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .	731.4703
as to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services .	843.1159
the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy .	853.6744
but while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .	735.02893
so we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation ' s needs for survival .	757.35046
the corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .	348.12875
ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .	248.85632
examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e . g . constructing major airports or dams .	522.94946
thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi-governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs .	383.8508
in all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship ' ' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .	230.60709
avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society	738.8394
and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .	361.36734
such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .	1685.7292
it can project long-range goals for itself .	503.08966
corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e . g . , quarterly and annual dividend reports .	966.2864
proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control	646.056
corporations , being more amorphous , cannot .	1418.5568
proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community .	729.72
corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public .	1042.2645
the proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders .	328.12155
leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .	295.84424
men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now .	996.71716
hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest .	943.54285
proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e . g . the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .	424.5965
corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) .	267.13873
the right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .	2365.8503
to perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic .	1046.6902
when the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it .	593.4186
strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole .	783.43695
strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .	686.58673
certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .	772.48895
if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? ?	497.32407
these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology .	520.8175
individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition .	1938.0627
we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders .	691.6722
persons developed in today ' s corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside .	530.7168
in my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , i have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal ' ' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .	251.67152
also , i am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .	1096.0879
any abilities i may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family .	346.6464
this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , i assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .	1466.534
perhaps a list of some of the `` practices ' ' of my company will help here .	116.3906
the company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles .	905.2419
from an initial investment of $1 , 200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10 , 000 , 000 ( we don ' t disclose financial figures to the public ) .	350.9743
its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth	816.7194
and no limitation is in evidence .	179.84584
our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition .	2041.7965
during the last years of woodrow wilson ' s administration , a red scare developed in our country .	471.55145
many americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force .	218.02385
postmaster general burleson set about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails .	437.52103
attorney general palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4 , 000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights .	583.0285
then , not many years later , the un-american activities committee , under the leadership of martin dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens .	1276.9238
anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government .	758.1316
this hysteria reached its height under the leadership of senator joseph mccarthy .	578.45184
demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions .	4395.7456
new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how .	427.8728
those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency .	1125.7036
they give strict interpretation to william james ' statement that `` every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself ' ' .	665.37195
they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .	1267.738
hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .	622.08093
despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools	326.44373
they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page	453.65335
they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply .	1048.7035
so all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others .	708.2942
seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away ' ' .	212.85757
that , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval .	242.90317
criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds .	943.8088
merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration .	445.31613
of course , there must be clarity a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones .	712.3125
the writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st . joseph , missouri .	294.99667
an inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts .	1764.5093
he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done .	154.68582
despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of einsteinian calibre .	970.3603
true , ideas are important , perhaps life ' s most precious treasures .	370.7183
but have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ? ?	3651.9421
have we not actually developed idea worship ? ?	555.7875
ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere .	157.92601
we scour literature for them	245.01102
here we find stored the wisdom of great minds .	214.98274
but are all these works worthy of consideration ? ?	466.57
can they stand rigid scrutiny ? ?	244.58508
shakespeare ' s wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries .	411.01633
but was he infallible in all things ? ?	64.67566
what of his treatment of the jew in the merchant of venice ? ?	131.22784
shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of shylock , but probably he never saw a jew , unless in some of his travels .	304.39294
the jews had been banished from england in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years .	1083.4633
if any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place .	2560.1099
shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life .	599.3132
rather than from a first-hand study of jewish people , his delineation of shylock stems from a collection of italian stories , il pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier .	2230.423
he could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit .	737.034
harris j . griston , in shaking the dust from shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes `` there is not a word spoken by shylock which one would expect from a real jew ' ' .	532.8397
he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone .	307.36075
the jew was the safest victim .	4596.0605
no jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .	4371.6196
it would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman .	2048.121
just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars , or even of tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result .	1550.7844
shakespeare does not tell us that shylock was an aberrant individual .	2152.9246
he sets him forth as being typical of the group .	152.7153
he tells of his `` jewish heart ' ' -- not a shylockian heart	698.77905
this would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge .	5544.8164
there is no justification for such misrepresentation .	673.62646
if living jews were unavailable for study , the bible was at hand .	576.00195
reading the old testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to shylock were abhorrent to the jews .	880.5823
are we better off for having shakespeare ' s idea of shylock ? ?	207.47345
studying the merchant of venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about jews .	973.6208
does this help the non-jew to understand this group ? ?	523.4516
thomas de torquemada , inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition , put many persons to death .	1110.1595
his name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty .	2563.8005
would we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today ' s roman catholics by saying he had a catholic heart ? ?	1821.2476
let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong	387.97293
he is out of place in our times .	142.41713
shakespeare ' s shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern world .	249.55836
ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good .	337.95352
a successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together .	1623.7255
will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ? ?	387.35757
frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .	1239.653
but is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ? ?	1553.2703
what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? ?	196.6245
is there some magic in it that assures results ? ?	513.0186
when peter b . kyne ( pride of palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the japanese , did the heated debates of the californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? ?	1161.0929
the leopard ' s spots came from the pen of thomas dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable ' ' law .	481.9003
if a child had a single drop of negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3 , 000 years .	403.45688
that doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? ?	356.7001
in the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked .	3555.532
the son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .	1920.7876
in time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child .	3400.84
is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? ?	636.2883
will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? ?	1390.0491
for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists .	293.12167
long ago they consigned the notions of kyne and dixon to the scrap heap .	1745.8707
false ideas surfeit another sector of our life .	171.03424
for several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship .	1784.4933
the stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress .	1790.6877
children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one .	808.4902
debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one .	556.00824
research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers .	672.6491
helen deutsch informed us ( the psychology of women , vol . 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications ' ' , a conclusion accepted by many .	749.8188
will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ?	749.1852
that is questionable , to say the least .	134.3803
research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .	441.32297
but ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough .	226.73758
in the 1930 ' s , cures for the depression literally flooded washington .	1062.4935
for a time the president received hundreds of them every day , most of them worthless .	560.92163
ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate .	317.01068
when some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign .	203.88641
we have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory .	1189.2845
the merits of the salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children .	1362.7622
our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument .	408.99576
but is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? ?	2085.03
man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad .	711.91113
but what a super-herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy .	1964.6113
we are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government .	217.82828
assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without restraint .	297.6079
but have the results been heartening ? ?	1101.8175
may we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? ?	473.50342
we must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results .	450.99484
in truth , we can say that this broke the power of senator joseph mccarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the american people .	306.65015
if he had been `` liquidated ' ' in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas .	267.52444
debate in the political arena can be productive of good .	398.41382
but it is a clumsy and wasteful process it can produce negative results but not much that is positive .	2176.604
debate rid us of mccarthy but did not give us much that is positive .	534.928
it did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure	1576.4441
it did not even provide the architect ' s plan for anything new .	211.96254
in the field of the natural sciences , scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results .	1229.7578
in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage .	405.75818
by no means would we discourage the production of ideas they provide raw materials with which to work	1844.1688
they provide stimulations that lead to further production .	522.3142
the president ' s personality would have opened that office to him .	382.96484
and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance .	372.2525
it is testimony to the deep respect in which mr . eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached .	305.67612
these began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the president ' s condition for the nation .	270.68503
and if howard rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the atlantic monthly accomplished a good deal more .	822.733
it forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed .	408.297
the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the president ' s decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem .	612.05634
because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the president , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .	1076.8947
for the president had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way .	729.503
but the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters .	223.62698
any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and president in a situation which should never have arisen .	314.9244
it was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at prediction .	651.46655
in no other situation would a group of doctors , struggling competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world , be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning , and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces .	934.1262
and though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error .	325.2993
it recurred in the press conferences the president ' s remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter .	529.3581
the press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions .	489.81107
he commented -- thoughtfully , a reporter told us -- that it was `` not too important for the individual how he ends up ' ' .	294.8912
he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running as in the battle of the bulge , he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers .	438.44058
yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences .	291.27097
in this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears .	228.33977
the presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent .	403.68954
it is of the utmost importance to the people of america and of the world how their governing president `` ends up ' ' during the four years of his term .	236.78668
only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death .	392.24146
ironically enough , in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury .	775.74316
at the national and international level , then , what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political immorality .	448.6002
and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us .	1063.842
for the tone of the editorials which greeted mr . eisenhower ' s original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting .	475.5237
neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people ' s intuitive sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation betraying its sense that something significant has transpired was in evidence .	2504.3076
nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine , the issue which also carried the second announcement of the candidacy .	525.0726
the double editorial on two aspects of `` the u . s . spirit ' ' was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well as small , reflecting popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the highest office in the land .	430.6471
`` the moral creed ' ' and `` the will to risk ' ' live happily together , if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn .	171.55708
`` i may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age ' ' , the president had said on february 29th of the election year , ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term .	271.63022
`` my doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great ' ' .	166.36908
but by the time the risk was doubled , events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza .	1834.3743
only infrequently did the situation color his thinking .	1233.6112
ironically no president we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the possibility to which his own words , in the press conference held at the beginning of august , testified that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country , unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation .	311.21686
so it is that we relive his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present .	464.00702
no consideration of risk urges itself upon him now for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly focussed .	484.60858
yet with a mind less shallow , if less sharp , than some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him , he feels what he cannot formulate	1070.3816
and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters .	1389.525
moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him , he adopts a position that is morally indefensible .	435.01825
he ascribes to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him .	478.88828
what is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later confirmed , has become by september of the election year `` a firm conviction ' ' .	274.7527
as a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place , the statement is an effective one we sympathize with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions .	565.1334
but it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history .	424.81158
in assigning to god the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors , eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration in the years to follow .	326.81442
in any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock .	1694.1606
about this man we had to think twice .	161.57579
we knew that it was , as reassurance , the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature .	486.13678
but the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions , and thus for imposing his will on the people .	654.1146
and in the context of drifting personal utterances we have examined , there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions .	1160.593
when the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners , mr . eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more .	445.27475
it was not to be resumed .	98.91852
the portrait that had developed , fragmentarily but consistently , was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits , when it does not forestall , any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence .	519.921
this does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked .	411.77588
instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done .	505.41406
drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president , eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking .	770.9607
despite three warnings , no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from wilson ' s .	502.6427
by contrast , the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man .	1114.1406
only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked .	1145.4397
in the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail , and to articulate the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant , with what is sometimes astounding rapidity .	629.2566
like lincoln , he can distinguish his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him .	1181.8461
like roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him .	652.9108
he chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed .	2053.1245
the very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader .	786.13165
the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact , and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the leader ' s means for transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership .	385.13568
the making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business .	306.93307
lincoln ' s slow progress towards the several marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such , and loosely interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision .	2122.9534
but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it , we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction , in the sphere of politics , on which decisions hang .	346.14362
only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize president kennedy ' s extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics .	503.80338
in his recent evaluation of kennedy ' s potentialities for leadership , walter lippmann has cited the `` precision ' ' of his mind , his `` immense command ' ' of factual detail , and his `` instinct for the crucial point ' ' as impressive in the extreme	237.12828
and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual ' s command of language interacts with the other two .	151.93768
for this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation .	359.6596
the liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups .	1270.789
rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .	207.04759
the division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change .	359.69205
rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man ' s life in society .	368.25595
these ways are absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for man ' s redemption from chaos .	1831.4358
the civilizational crisis , the third type of change raises the question `` what are we to do ' ' ? ?	232.9723
for the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community .	867.93024
there is no socially existential answer to the question .	286.5469
for the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has existential status in the community , nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians .	2099.507
in this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community .	1863.6736
an interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence .	690.01917
if we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke .	403.1715
the first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society .	527.2616
the first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .	196.2531
the second involves something deeper , but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests .	312.00317
thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself , and its phenomenological life .	671.37537
the third type , however , wrenches attention from the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence .	292.85315
voegelin has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable , healthy community .	153.94316
there the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced .	383.4787
this , however , cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and incoherent it has no absolute standard , and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent .	557.68506
it has lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances .	786.7261
relativism and equality are its characteristic diseases .	898.6673
precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself .	423.95883
for paradigmatic history `` breaks ' ' rather than unfolds precisely when the movement is from order to disorder , and not from one order to a new order .	411.271
the liberal-conservative split , to define it further , derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification .	652.7026
when disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order , the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return .	550.5663
indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins .	364.64575
at that point we reach the `` closed ' ' historical situation the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante .	520.70074
at that point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously `` fate ' ' , or `` destiny ' ' , or `` providence ' ' , and feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society .	297.3628
the reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change .	303.53128
of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of determinability .	406.4551
its ontological status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual men , who are its `` matter ' ' , tradition , the `` form ' ' of society exists only as a shared perception of truth .	302.03983
the ontological status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of society ' s members .	353.74744
the content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization .	398.10236
those social , civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist .	283.6218
civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused .	838.81274
civilization is what man has made of himself .	124.722565
its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself .	339.7992
it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse .	680.8676
he needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion .	83.53752
and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself .	252.87843
he must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not exist as man .	877.95306
thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence ' ' .	508.68362
this happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in maritain ' s words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities ' ' .	518.8068
an existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse ' ' , as existence without substance .	492.2851
thus human perception and human volition is the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the civilizational level .	1069.3241
thus with regard to the loss of tradition , in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works itself out as a disruption of the individual soul , a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent , but no longer as a man .	353.1835
further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change .	399.65668
with regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? ?	538.15393
a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process .	340.1041
change involves the displacement of form .	77.21225
this means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .	1510.8007
if the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation .	261.5427
in the case of social decay , form is displaced simply by the process of dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process .	712.1179
now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fading form .	410.876
and when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence , any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence .	677.5887
the retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation .	1499.6318
however , the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening of spiritual forces .	2898.9395
it would seem , therefore , that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself .	406.66177
the emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder .	764.1426
and it would seem that history is a witness to this truth .	228.58185
as a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history .	696.76166
these differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change .	1051.1466
anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition .	753.4707
to experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it .	168.73996
the process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs .	928.2092
within the individual the reaction has been called various names , all , however , pointing to the same basic experience .	297.23734
weil identifies it as being `` rootless ' ' , guardini as being `` placeless ' ' , riesman as being `` lonely ' ' .	602.9234
others call it `` alienation ' ' , and mean by that no simple economic experience ( as marx does ) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation .	655.7104
within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one of persuasion .	912.8819
we note the use of rhetoric as a weapon , the manipulation of the masses by propaganda , the `` mobilization ' ' of effort and resources .	187.88477
within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis , two basic organizations of response are observable reaction and ideological progressivism .	1712.5859
these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis .	429.881
both are predictably destined to fail .	91.25398
the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing .	514.3712
its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .	1041.6638
to this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers .	1273.3202
the implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible .	463.8462
seemingly , order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious accretions .	5725.003
the problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there .	786.28723
such a response , of course , misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence .	315.1974
moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order , once the activation of change has reached visible proportions .	829.35706
the most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself .	863.2954
despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself .	155.0215
since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class .	553.9653
their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change .	456.1111
since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention .	657.2101
and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status .	2273.8809
the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational .	325.69354
but this truth is distorted by its extreme application the assumption of the separate existence of tradition .	490.92035
the reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations .	1463.8965
reactionary theories , for this reason , usually assume some form of organismic theory .	755.39056
in its defensive formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community .	161.32289
in its dynamic form , it visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force -- the race , for instance , which unfolds in history .	349.91302
in both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality .	401.81
when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual defense , the characteristics of that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction .	719.5861
reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole .	171.2888
it is a total situation that is defended the `` good old days ' ' .	186.79832
even the questionable features of the past are defended .	197.90327
the point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference .	333.9032
the reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy .	460.35153
all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work .	333.85178
is the oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? ?	291.71558
if we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , isn ' t there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? ?	402.98853
i am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst ' s consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life .	560.4001
a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man	976.7778
his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial .	709.5402
now we can argue that the irresistible fate of oedipus rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .	1169.7721
we can also argue that the three brothers karamazov and smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father ' s woman .	696.8185
but a novel in which one man karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic quarterly .	1453.6255
it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of oedipus complex as a literary descendant of oedipus rex .	891.55225
whatever the psychological truth in the oedipus myth , an oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret .	746.05975
but a modern oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose his own childhood is only pathetic , and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies .	650.54
i am suggesting that a case-history approach to the oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller .	1749.5668
the best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him .	507.948
incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation .	236.93036
and the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story .	586.5045
which brings to mind another lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the oedipal theme .	656.60333
`` the rocking horse winner ' ' is also a story about a boy ' s love for his mother .	173.92358
if i now risk some comparisons with sons and lovers let it be clear that i am not comparing the two works or judging their merits	1073.9286
i am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects .	220.09488
`` the rocking horse winner ' ' is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader -- but we do not know why .	246.478
it is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and vain mother .	339.41037
there are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse .	662.87524
the child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother .	802.64575
the story ends in the child ' s illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother .	560.04767
the child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside .	1764.1837
i had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did .	1692.2932
but on one occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient i began to understand the uncanny effects of this story .	400.09634
it was , of course , a little boy ' s fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .	347.6621
why does the story affect us ? ?	1307.9603
how does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader ? ?	959.40466
the rocking is actually felt in the story , a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy .	835.50745
the rocking , i realized , is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message , the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child ' s fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit .	428.19855
the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present	4250.681
it conceals and yet is suggestive	3910.47
and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy .	573.995
for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden love , doomed by its nature .	517.22375
we are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy ' s love for his mother does not offend , while the incestuous love of the man , paul morel , sometimes repels .	309.61676
this love belongs to childhood	9789.223
we accord it its place there , and in lawrence ' s treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child , in fact , the form in which oedipal love is expressed in childhood .	273.61734
and when the child dies in lawrence ' s story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make his mother rich , the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all .	422.2373
we have so completely entered the child ' s fantasy that his illness and his death are the plausible and the necessary conclusion .	372.54068
i am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood .	665.2396
it is most probable that freud and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story .	345.1396
he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told , and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged .	208.89557
he would not have cared why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy .	650.2537
in our own time we have seen that the novelist ' s debt to psychoanalysis has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from this marriage .	470.43436
ortega ' s hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled .	1399.6488
the young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge	9829.346
he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights .	202.68097
he borrows the insights of psychology to improve his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist ' s own .	630.752
he has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character .	349.9429
if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior , that the ego is still the executive agency of personality , and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego .	715.0925
the novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the same faces .	998.3078
i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature .	1019.3227
but a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth , the joke that strikes right at the center of man ' s humanness .	520.2295
moral dread is seen as the other face of desire , and here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity .	1247.1204
there is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth .	514.69604
the ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies , but the myth fails before the modern truth	2822.687
the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true .	2912.4597
in both the farmer ' s tale in ralph ellison ' s invisible man and in thomas mann ' s the holy sinner , the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive	1042.4374
the heroic act is the casting off of pretense .	2276.6245
thomas mann wrote the holy sinner in 1951 .	1082.5668
it was conceived as a leave-taking , a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths of the west , `` bevor die nacht sinkt , eine lange nacht vielleicht und ein tiefes vergessen ' ' .	203.64119
he chose a medieval legend of incest , gregorius vom stein , and freely borrowed and parodied other myths of the west , mixing themes , language , peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves , as in his previous treatment of joseph .	885.60596
but the holy sinner is not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man ' s entertainment .	341.42645
mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell .	371.16156
and when he retold the legend of gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language	3457.6387
while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner .	945.58545
grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins sibylla and wiligis .	1302.5076
he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast adrift soon after birth .	1316.0884
the infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him .	699.061
an ivory tablet in the infant ' s cask recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village .	682.4177
grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins .	1101.9305
his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own country at a time when sibylla ' s domain is overrun by the armies of one of her rejected suitors .	623.1191
grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him .	742.7441
sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband , and the identities of mother and son are revealed .	813.1378
grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years .	374.7923
at the end of this period two pious christians in rome receive the revelation which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock .	1232.8502
grigorss comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope .	512.58997
in the last pages of the book sibylla comes to rome to seek an audience with the great pope and to give her confession .	583.0869
mother and son recognize each other and , in mann ' s version of this legend , make a remarkable confession of guilt to each other , the confession of unconscious motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the time they had first set eyes on each other .	360.321
in recollection he has said `` natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but i would suppress them sternly ' ' .	760.49884
moreover , he organized the movement of his forms , within his rigorously shaped space , into highly complex equilibriums	1469.006
and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors .	1501.8961
the worthy mondrian , seeing these pictures , said in a tone of kindly reproof `` but you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition ' ' ! !	402.0277
helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true .	47.96761
his `` monumental ' ' abstraction , made up of smooth , metallic `` non-objects ' ' acting upon each other with great tension , won helion much acclaim during the ' thirties .	942.1599
the play of novel lighting effects also entered into these compositions , whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth meditating .	1805.1667
as helion ' s work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval	608.76
but leger , arp , lipchitz and alexander calder , at the time , gave him their blessing .	161.99252
his canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be `` figures in space ' ' , or `` blue figure ' ' , or `` pink figure ' '	158.04572
and they had ( vaguely ) heads and feet .	391.9427
exhibited in shows in london in 1935 , and in new york the following year , the new , more elaborated abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional dramas of great intellectual coherence .	734.1234
at this period the thirty-year old helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement ' ' , according to herbert read , `` and in the direct line of descent from cezanne , seurat , gris and leger ' ' .	439.4855
in america , meyer schapiro observed that , unlike the mondrian school , helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art ' ' .	634.3803
it is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of cimabue ' s and poussin ' s way of filling space .	252.91328
abstract art was still the right path for him	442.94086
but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction ' ' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the raphaels and poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and mondrian .	447.15924
later helion wrote of this phase `` for years i built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name .	544.06433
i played on it my secret songs , unexplained , passionate and peaceful ' ' .	570.55695
but his own work was evolving further .	2042.8981
the extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold .	2687.8496
he was engaged in constant experiments that searched for new directions .	2396.262
where would it all lead ? ?	184.86943
he himself did not know , as he said in 1935 .	88.831894
but he was `` afraid of the future -- he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration , a functional art of some kind ' ' .	216.08644
during the 1920 ' s the abstractionists , the german bauhaus group of industrial designers , and the new architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia , or welfare state , in which their neat and logical constructions might find their proper place .	631.42035
but whereas the postwar american abstractionists seem to helion to be determined to `` escape ' ' from the real world , or simply to rebel against it , the ordered abstractions which he and his associates of the 1930 ' s were painting embodied the hope of `` improving ' ' things .	548.01154
`` we were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come , very pure and elevated ' ' , he has said , `` in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918 ' ' .	261.372
instead of this the 1930 ' s witnessed a tragic economic depression , the rise of fascist dictators in europe , the wasting civil war in spain .	1027.5692
very much the political man , helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of france and all europe , whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky .	771.12946
in 1936 he decided to migrate to america .	357.284
the rooseveltian america was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for civilization .	527.2727
helion also hoped that america ' s mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works .	345.9339
`` i arrived in the united states with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions ' ' .	496.78342
in new york he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including alexander calder , george k . l . morris , de kooning , holty and a few others .	705.7125
after a year in a studio on sheridan square , having married an american girl who was a native of virginia , helion moved to a village in the blue ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases .	560.8481
the darkening world scene , at the time of the munich pact , continued to trouble his mind even in his remote virginia studio .	459.45352
`` fear possessed me , and the certainty of war ' ' , he has related .	57.11925
`` i truly smelled blood , death , heaps of corpses everywhere ' ' .	590.2629
in haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings a three-panel frieze , with a flying figure and a fallen figure	1231.4901
a `` double-figure ' ' , which went to the chicago art institute , and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts	207.38573
and in early 1939 , a `` fallen figure ' ' of very ominous character , which concluded his abstract phase .	328.75473
`` i knew i was carrying on with abstraction to its very end -- for me ' ' , he said of the two years ' output in virginia .	188.33704
with those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he felt he could stop .	2370.228
they were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art .	25333.986
he had taken out first papers for american citizenship	2263.3997
but after war came to europe , he decided to return to france , arriving there in january , 1940 .	227.89412
`` i hated the war ' ' , he said , `` but thought i ought to go because i was , perhaps , one of those who hadn ' t done enough to prevent it ' ' .	99.12372
in june , 1940 , sergeant helion , with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle , was sketching the hills south of the loire river , when the war suddenly rolled in upon him .	948.72614
its first apparition was a long , gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons , or pushing prams .	3555.8882
his company then carried out a confused retreating movement until it was surrounded by the germans , a few days before france capitulated .	755.63666
after a sort of death march during four days without food , helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in east germany .	1628.335
a year later they were removed to a stalag in the harbor of stettin .	291.4581
at the time of his capture helion had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at woolworth ' s in new york .	981.477
when he was stripped , deloused and numbered by his guards , his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners ' goods to be confiscated .	1892.386
`` it was then i knew that they were making war against man , the individual within ! !	263.19244
-- who questioned things when given orders ' ' .	143.83873
at stettin the university-educated artist , who had studied german , was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the stalag commander .	418.87433
in secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners ' central committee , which plotted sabotage , planned a few escapes , and maintained a hidden control over the wretched french slave-laborers .	1251.8595
in the stalag , helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other .	663.7723
how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape .	210.58348
in the prison camp ' s black market civilian clothes were quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him	2575.685
during long weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed .	634.1843
every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories .	664.4445
one evening , while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard among the prisoners remaining there , a simulated melee was staged -- just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from work .	1243.0956
four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me .	951.87274
finot held a wallet with my money and papers	519.3189
moineau and david held nothing but their fingers .	1011.1395
they felt rough and kind and warm .	567.9627
at this moment the volley-ball hit the ground .	1851.3169
duclos ran toward desprez with fists raised .	3800.6724
the guards all rushed up to intervene ' '	245.1654
shedding his prison cloak , helion shot through the gates , now clad in civilian garments and with the passport of a flemish worker .	923.6796
riding trains , hitching hikes on trucks across germany , slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of secret guides , he eventually reached vichy france , and , by the winter of 1943 , was back in virginia .	1067.322
to escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind	956.34216
not only loathing of captivity , but a faith , a hope that is even stronger .	502.27423
i left behind me brave men , whom captivity had robbed of all hope .	1675.666
they too loved their families , longed for their villages yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare the fearful chance of escape ' ' .	754.66406
it was a time of revelations for him .	421.34552
even the most rational of men , under great stress , may be transported by a new faith and behave like mystics .	518.26263
helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice of his fellow-men in arbeitskommando 13 , , stettin , as to his own fierce will and love of life .	978.44574
after that , he declared , `` to return to freedom was to fall to one ' s knees before the real world and adore it ' ' .	168.37233
in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life , his guards , his companions in misery .	618.87695
now all his desires centered on `` rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence ' ' .	977.8874
and , he added `` during the many months in prison camp , all abstract images vanished from my mind ' ' .	359.1037
before leaving for america , he happened to see his old friend jean arp and confided to him his new resolutions .	579.82294
arp protested `` but it is impossible ! !	85.27293
everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters ' ' .	159.73145
helion , however , clung to the belief that `` in escaping from the stalag i had also escaped from abstraction ' ' .	322.8451
while convalescing in his virginia home he wrote a book recording his prison experiences and escape , entitled they shall not have me published originally in ( helion ' s ) english by dutton & co . of new york , in 1943 , the book was received by the press as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic accounts of world war 2 , from the french side .	436.40527
it was very widely read , too	347.25058
and the author , who seemed the embodiment of france ' s rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors , was much complimented for his daring military action .	714.3309
but when he showed his new figurative pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp , they paid him no compliments and drew long faces .	759.9779
between 1944 and 1947 helion had a series of one-man shows -- at the paul rosenberg gallery in new york and in paris -- of his new realistic pictures .	654.6597
they reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920 ' s .	402.07794
these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted french bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them .	853.8454
one of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette	4158.848
others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out .	3029.2761
important as was mr . o ' donnell ' s essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has .	470.4099
he and also mr . cowley and mr . warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- nathaniel hawthorne , for example , and herman melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .	828.7206
faulkner ' s total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr . cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when mr . o ' donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the south .	321.01968
if he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist .	996.0534
if he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force .	354.88953
if he sees the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen , he sees also -- and he shows -- the blind and the mean , and he sees the compson family disintegrating from within .	915.9358
if the barn-burner ' s family produces a flem snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the compson family produces a jason compson 4 .	4614.8984
others writing on faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional moralist ' ' either inadequate or misleading .	1200.6279
among them are frederick j . hoffman , william van o ' connor , and mrs . olga vickery .	558.575
they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , i believe , in pointing out faulkner ' s independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the southern tradition .	407.9502
faulkner ' s is not the mind of the apologist which mr . o ' donnell implies that it is .	278.02826
he is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at oxford , mississippi , thirty-five years ago .	544.5266
that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .	130.76834
it is to say rather , i believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .	266.5501
he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed southern .	1762.7281
the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern , i rather think , for the south has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .	737.7798
some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly southern traits .	420.06766
there is no necessity , i suppose , to assert that mr . faulkner is southern .	187.7098
it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family .	657.1013
and , after all , he has lived comfortably at both oxford , mississippi , and charlottesville , virginia .	498.92377
the young william faulkner in new orleans in the 1920 ' s impressed the novelist hamilton basso as obviously conscious of being a southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so .	394.28827
besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the south during the past hundred years .	423.78763
it is more difficult with faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge .	266.07642
his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the south , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation .	302.16013
his denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the south or have written about the south .	466.11752
to believe otherwise would be unrealistic .	396.9622
but in looking at faulkner against his background in mississippi and the south , it is important not to lose the broader perspective .	348.03314
his earliest work reflected heavy influences from english and continental writers .	1058.857
evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , henry james and james joyce among them .	1068.4169
his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him .	511.44537
my intention , therefore , is not to say that faulkner ' s awareness has been confined within the borders of the south , but rather that he has looked at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook is southern .	214.77629
the ingredients of faulkner ' s novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him .	233.68372
a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , i think , by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region .	629.3178
the planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton kennedy published swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature .	3304.8662
the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .	228.43791
as they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed .	691.351
their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the south , even while memories of the war were still sharp .	539.6546
the tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of thomas nelson page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel so red the rose , by stark young .	1012.0864
although faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have stark young ' s inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society .	817.81134
the myth of the southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as francis pendleton gaines showed forty years ago , and i suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed .	1140.7428
faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .	743.5123
without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the sartoris and the compson families faulkner ' s chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the civil war .	718.3304
it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .	706.5637
faulkner ' s low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels dealing with plantation life .	4087.0684
they have an ancestry extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when william byrd described the lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina .	728.12604
the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the south and the southwest in the three decades before the civil war .	336.35565
these narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of horace , mr . addison , mr . pope , and sir walter scott .	990.1961
there is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south .	476.727
william gilmore simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .	1566.9412
simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully .	484.63443
augustus baldwin longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character ransy sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him .	1211.3477
others who wrote of low characters and low life included thomas bangs thorpe , creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom owen , the bee-hunter	1340.4585
johnson jones hooper , whose character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will	2411.979
and george washington harris , whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature .	2795.821
it would be profitable , i believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkner ' s works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to faulkner ' s time .	463.08618
such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent .	1596.1565
such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers	692.90674
nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .	337.97998
one of the early humorists already mentioned , thomas bangs thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .	2804.8572
thorpe came to louisiana from the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty .	441.93704
but thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions .	600.0175
as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble , arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano	616.44745
and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` the big bear of arkansas ' ' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .	712.26666
some years ago julian huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the british association for the advancement of science that `` man ' s supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age ' ' .	467.53036
as a humanist , dr . huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading zoologist , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution .	398.29736
this text from dr . huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic powers in human beings .	645.44604
there may be a case of this sort , but it is not one we wish to argue , here .	95.564926
even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another ' s minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man ' s mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books .	242.4321
even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners , one may question whether this will help them to live better lives .	733.4541
there would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course	180.02826
such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists	934.36005
but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article .	177.39156
all we want from dr . huxley ' s statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible .	327.96402
it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many .	285.46786
each man , that is , is both one and many .	184.45532
he is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect , and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time .	135.30632
he is a parent with a child to nurture , here and now , and he is an educator who worries about the children half way round the world .	390.67236
he is a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the circumstances of today .	413.425
he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself .	303.38397
he is a craig ' s wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the local university have come to call .	1516.1049
he is the stern guardian of the status quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age , and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed .	365.7618
what will be the final symmetry of the good society ? ?	199.36244
for what do the utopians labor ? ?	1117.6237
here , on a desk , is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions .	258.52472
the pamphlets are about law , the corporation , forms of government , the idea of freedom , the defense of liberty , the various lethargies which overtake our major institutions , the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization .	626.6691
the thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor .	716.73834
there is another kind of ardor , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life , but no angry utopian contentions .	1320.6178
actually , you could wish for some passion , now and then , but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos of current history which partisan social passions have wrought , you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized calm .	484.65524
you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity .	773.9287
there is essential pleasantness in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can contend without quarreling .	622.7822
this is the good kind of sophistication , and with all our problems and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the united states during recent years .	408.80957
a characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry is found in joseph p . lyford ' s introduction to the agreeable autocracies , a recent paperback study of the institutions of modern democratic society .	483.86368
mr . lyford gives voice to a temper that represents , we think , an achieved plateau of reflective thinking .	483.67593
after casting about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use mr . lyford ' s introduction as an illustration .	142.98503
at one time it seemed as if the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations .	585.3737
as things turned out , however , we have not profited greatly from the lesson instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed to be at the moment .	379.30392
such activity may or may not have irritated the kremlin , but it has frequently condemned america to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the free world .	849.1258
the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit , our tendency to rate the `` goodness ' ' or `` badness ' ' of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves .	445.04846
since the slogans have little application to reality and are sanctimonious to boot , the applause is faint even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government .	507.1849
shocked at the response to our proclamations , we grow more defensive , and worse , we lose our sense of humor and proportion .	586.42145
mr . nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our department of state , and an american president observes sourly that sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic ' ' .	994.8108
one thing you can say about mr . lyford is that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an american .	185.07811
those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination .	878.6282
only the strong look squarely at weakness .	2998.4246
the maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood .	656.63214
even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society .	571.7067
we would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries .	232.52328
the picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of american life .	568.138
the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great , and it does not escape the notice of others .	671.72217
if our sincerity is granted , and it is granted , the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination .	436.7708
what is more , the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason , and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels .	3337.356
although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to `` free private enterprise ' ' , `` individual initiative ' ' , `` the democratic way ' ' , `` government of the people ' ' , `` competition of the marketplace ' ' , etc . , we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas , bureaucracy is corroding representative government , technology is weakening the citizen ' s confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground ' ' .	261.31155
the interesting thing about mr . lyford ' s approach , and the approach of the contributors to the agreeable autocracies ( oceana publications , 1961 ) to the situation of american civilization , is that it is concerned with comprehending the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on american life .	271.4931
in an ideological argument , the participants tend to thump the table .	485.56686
they are determined to prove something .	619.357
the new spirit , so well illustrated by mr . lyford ' s work , is wholly free of this anxiety .	188.35896
the problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves ' ' .	276.03937
we experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them .	482.1814
we feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them .	326.06616
it does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on the national purpose .	164.947
the agreeable autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today .	343.73007
the men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world ' ' .	367.25327
these institutions which mr . lyford names `` agreeable autocracies ' ' -- where did they come from ? ?	237.5239
of one thing we can be sure they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society ' ' .	409.10986
no doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century .	229.10616
going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the center for the study of democratic institutions , in santa barbara .	375.64523
but however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to expose , right now , is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises .	326.5678
the host is the flowing life of the human race .	246.55357
this life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations .	914.44336
on occasion it produces extraordinary novelties .	2941.9795
should rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the advent of television , atomic energy , and ibm machines ? ?	348.1754
how would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the field ? ?	455.9311
they tell us , sir , that we are free , because we have in one hand a ballot , and in the other a stock certificate .	191.12274
with these we shape our destiny and own private property , and that , sir , makes ours the best of all possible societies .	385.97656
the reality of the situation , however , is described by mr . lyford ``	79.2507
many of us may even be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts .	1763.0433
thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall	961.37756
and the citizen narrows his political participation to the mere act of voting -- if he votes at all ' ' .	276.25824
copernicus did not question it , ptolemy could not .	1200.8678
given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? ?	928.462
the reasons for this are partly observational , partly philosophical , and reinforced by other aesthetic and cultural factors .	1217.9463
the obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens .	1226.731
not only did constellations like draco , cepheus , and cassiopeia spin circles around the pole , but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night .	1408.2666
nor did a constellation ' s stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights .	978.3361
the conclusion -- the distances of the constellations did not vary and their paths were circular .	649.9666
moreover , the sun ' s path over earth described a segment of a great circle	931.38464
this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon .	1241.4039
as early as the 6th century b . c . the earth was seen to be spherical .	221.06021
ships disappear hull-first over the horizon	281.35223
approaching shore their masts appeared first .	521.27563
earth , being at the center of the universe , would have the same shape as the latter	126.21134
so , e . g . did aristotle argue , although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity .	424.5702
the discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things .	486.38882
in light of all this , one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular .	415.42007
why , for example , should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of the heavens to be elliptical ? ?	1218.2891
there were no reasons for such suppositions then .	1066.8905
this , conjoined with the considerations above , made the circular motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly observed fact .	1664.8026
additional philosophical considerations , advanced notably by aristotle , supported further the circularity principle .	2871.3396
by distinguishing superlunary ( celestial ) and sublunary ( terrestrial ) existence , and reinforcing this with the four-element physics of empedocles , aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies , which moved in only a perfect way , viz . in a perfect circle .	795.6457
now what is perfect motion ? ?	137.27708
it must , apparently , be motion without termini .	1472.5133
because motion which begins and ends at discrete places would ( e . g . for aristotle ) be incomplete .	491.06198
circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , lacks termini .	658.31354
it is never motion towards something .	690.00964
only imcomplete , imperfect things move towards what they lack .	753.09894
perfect , complete entities , if they move at all , do not move towards what they lack .	163.33803
they move only in accordance with what is in their natures .	380.4665
thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect celestial existence .	975.42755
to return now to the four-element physics , a mixture of muddy , frothy water will , when standing in a jar , separate out with earth at the bottom , water on top , and the air on top of that .	614.50055
a candle alight in the air directs its flame and smoke upwards .	2466.226
this gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements .	757.62787
thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe .	53.506687
it is covered ( partly ) with water , air is atop of that .	595.9651
pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens .	264.98312
when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material substratum , it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios , celestial bodies will be of a subtle , quickened , ethereal existence , in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary .	1178.9304
the stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth .	588.09155
this is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions .	767.6694
a projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its ' natural ' place of rest .	1791.3325
but the natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest , nor rectilinear motion .	1189.8007
being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake more of what is divine .	2584.6826
their motion will be eternal and perfect .	688.10095
let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic and copernican astronomy .	1982.156
bluntly , there never was a ptolemaic system of astronomy .	286.2732
copernicus ' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy .	743.1069
the almagest and the hypotheses outline ptolemy ' s conception of his own task as the provision of computational tables , independent calculating devices for the prediction of future planetary perturbations .	1975.1891
indeed , in the halma edition of theon ' s presentation of the hypotheses there is a chart setting out ( under six distinct headings ) otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing the planetary motions .	2335.654
no attempt is made by ptolemy to weld into a single scheme ( a-la-aristotle ) , these independent predicting-machines .	1488.2384
they all have this in common the earth is situated near the center of the deferent .	357.08643
but that one should superimpose all these charts , run a pin through the common point , and then scale each planetary deferent larger and smaller ( to keep the epicycles from ' bumping ' ) , this is contrary to any intention ptolemy ever expresses .	1340.0579
he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity .	600.456
ptolemy ' s problem is to forecast where , against the inverted bowl of night , some particular light will be found at future times .	700.5041
his problem concerns longitudes , latitudes , and angular velocities .	938.05725
the distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master , beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth .	1996.5737
but none of this has prevented scientists , philosophers , and even historians of science , from speaking of the ptolemaic system , in contrast to the copernican .	431.84885
it is engendered by confounding the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the geocentric astronomy .	3330.6567
ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion .	1643.7086
this is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .	1282.7808
so when textbooks , like that of baker set out drawings of the ' ptolemaic system ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically .	1128.019
it is the chief merit in copernicus ' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent .	826.794
he cannot , e . g . compute the retrograde arc traveled by mars , without also making suppositions about the earth ' s own motion .	618.4203
he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem .	1372.1661
in ptolemaic terms , however , eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter , to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations .	2992.431
in a systematic astronomy , like that of copernicus , retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system	435.49103
they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions .	2116.7246
another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs . copernican astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity .	1042.6299
it is often stated that copernican astronomy is ' simpler ' than ptolemaic .	12998.553
some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former .	132.22345
thus , margenau remarks `` a large number of unrelated epicycles was needed to explain the observations , but otherwise the ( ptolemaic ) system served well and with quantitative precision .	429.41003
copernicus , by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe , was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen .	258.27963
historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called ' revolution ' , unaware perhaps of its historical importance , he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction .	720.13434
as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized	1901.4574
it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen ' ' .	212.29916
without careful qualification this can be misleading .	230.58673
if in any one calculation ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once , while copernicus never required more than one third this number , then ( in the sense obvious to margenau ) ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than copernican .	2543.9158
but no single planetary problem ever required of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time .	1746.6783
this , of course , results from the non-systematic , ' cellular ' character of ptolemaic theory .	1034.7745
calculations within the copernican framework always raised questions about planetary configurations .	6155.7773
these could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time .	685.86523
this is more ambitious than ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems .	458.86694
thus , in no ordinary sense of ' simplicity ' is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the copernican .	1022.5645
the latter required juggling several elements simultaneously .	2848.2515
this was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within ptolemy ' s astronomy .	1139.0486
analogously , anyone who argues that einstein ' s theory of gravitation is simpler than newton ' s , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts .	500.94507
in a sense , einstein ' s theory is simpler than newton ' s , and there is a corresponding sense in which copernicus ' theory is simpler than ptolemy ' s .	416.6546
but ' simplicity ' here refers to systematic simplicity .	2675.459
the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum .	1294.5128
the axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .	1866.8062
this characterizes euclid ' s formulation of geometry , but not ptolemy ' s astronomy .	206.76276
there are in the almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar , solar , or planetary behavior .	1859.2117
the strongest appeal of the copernican formulation consisted in just this ideally , the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic ' rules ' of the theory .	377.3729
the lower-level hypotheses are never ' ad hoc ' , never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum .	4939.4424
copernicus , to an extent unachieved by ptolemy , approximated to euclid ' s vision .	3670.605
de revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques .	288.47556
it is an organized system of these things .	183.45421
solving astronomical problems requires , for copernicus , not a random search of unrelated tables , but a regular employment of the rules defining the entire discipline .	700.19794
hence , noting the simplicity achieved in copernicus ' formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of de revolutionibus , another reason beyond its systematic superiority .	618.02734
it provides exactly the same reason .	214.32399
1543 a . d . is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution .	412.74936
it is really the funeral day of scholastic science .	1480.2395
granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the de revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow .	751.42053
but , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced .	376.93784
in what does the dissatisfaction of copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?	3244.8877
what in the almagest draws his fire ? ?	622.27374
the formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being copernicus ' primary concern , was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy , namely , the ' unphysical ' triplication of centric reference-points one center from which the planet ' s distances were calculated , another around which planetary velocities were computed , and still a third center ( the earth ) from which the observations originated .	1892.2858
this arrangement was for copernicus literally monstrous `` with ( the ptolemaists ) it is as though an artist were to gather the hands , feet , head and other members for his images from divers models , each part excellently drawn , but not related to a single body	1009.18243
and since they in no way match each other , the result would be a monster rather than a man ' ' .	384.84634
copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy .	2366.3455
his objective was , essentially , to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends .	1475.003
that such deficiencies existed within ptolemy ' s theory was not discovered de novo by copernicus .	1250.6578
the critical , rigorous examinations of nicholas of cusa and nicholas of oresme provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for nicholas copernicus ' own work .	8948.577
the latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies .	2260.1028
without abandoning too much , copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable .	2568.012
he did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution .	311.4875
henrietta ' s feeling of identity with sara sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that sara ' s epitaph in the jewish cemetery in venice referred to her as `` the sulamite ' ' .	724.2654
into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women `` in their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander .	924.43933
his feeling always exacted sacrifices from her .	733.3502
one is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette .	579.8379
the very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts	2727.8801
usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .	1677.6016
she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .	570.2912
women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld .	654.343
she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .	488.25223
one who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .	1144.1039
in any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual	324.62402
the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .	1067.8367
and , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature .	1184.3203
henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition .	329.17606
dr . isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of sara sullam that he considered submitting it to the century magazine or harper ' s but he decided that its jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in the messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead ' ' .	592.67206
under her father ' s influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the jewish field , but she did begin writing for other anglo-jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience .	552.5902
and she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of judas maccabeus performed at the hanukkah festival which came in december .	2911.7153
by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that papa and mamma gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her aspiration .	855.3695
another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of johns hopkins university within walking distance of home .	1471.4661
it was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district , with only a few professors , but all eminent men , and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings .	453.38477
in september ' 76 thomas huxley , darwin ' s famous disciple , came from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the university	605.435
and although it was a school for men only , it afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures .	499.22385
in the following year her father undertook to give a course in hebrew theology to johns hopkins students , and this brought to the szold house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by mamma and entertained by henrietta and rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on sunday evenings .	995.56055
from philadelphia came cyrus adler and joseph jastrow .	1348.7943
adler , judge sulzberger ' s nephew , came to study assyriology .	1116.4231
a smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go far .	342.7423
joseph jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , marcus jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease .	1056.0676
his father was a good friend of rabbi szold , and joe lived with the szolds for a while .	778.194
both these youths , who greatly admired henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine	1883.1611
and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with papa , whose mind -- although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it -- naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were .	1079.8678
besides , miss henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing	532.6667
so cyrus adler became interested in her friend racie friedenwald , and joe jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as henrietta , and signed himself joe -- fell in love with pretty sister rachel .	1516.9734
henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with joe ' s older and more serious brother , morris , who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia with papa , when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at rodeph shalom temple there during its rabbi ' s absence in europe .	670.1385
young morris , who , while attending the university of pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write henrietta twenty-page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of sarah bernhardt in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` sulamith ' ' on the jewish reform movement being promulgated by the hebrew union college in cincinnati .	726.65436
unlike his younger brother , joe , he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as `` my dear friend ' ' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style .	861.38416
and when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did .	200.20688
one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .	1110.9984
she could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man ' ' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies ' ' of sara sullam	461.08112
and in her forthright way , henrietta , who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged ' ' and `` women as submissive and yielding ' ' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of dr . wise of hebrew union college -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .	585.8881
but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively szolds in their pleasant house on lombard street .	1156.8073
`` we ' ve got father and mother and each other ' ' said beth on the first page of louisa alcott ' s little women	1584.5206
and , `` i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world ' ' , burst out jo some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the march family , which had first appeared when henrietta was eight	420.36942
and the szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the marches .	386.55972
mr . march , like benjamin szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination	1047.2144
and `` marmee ' ' march , like sophie szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the marches had only four to the szolds ' five .	842.48535
but the march girls had their counterparts in the szold girls .	635.0956
henrietta could easily identify herself with jo march , although jo was not the eldest sister .	1662.8066
neither was henrietta hoydenish like jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like henrietta ' s , was the feminine form of a boy ' s name .	381.81503
but both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers to control , both loved languages , especially english and german , both were good teachers and wrote for publication .	808.00494
each was her mother ' s assistant and confidante	1797.7673
and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture .	388.97156
bertha szold was more like meg , the eldest march girl , who `` learned that a woman ' s happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother ' ' .	452.69437
bertha , blue-eyed like mamma , was from the start her mother ' s daughter , destined for her mother ' s role in life .	319.62823
sadie , like beth march , suffered ill health -- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart -- but that never dampened her spirits .	955.2005
when her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , sadie learned to write with her left hand .	878.6839
she wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like `` oh , what fun ! !	1229.8962
a comedy in three acts ' ' , in which , under `` personages ' ' , henrietta appeared as `` a schoolmarm ' ' , and bertha , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta had been , appeared as `` dummkopf ' ' .	290.37012
played chopin in the `` soiree musicale of mr . guthrie ' s pupils ' '	439.78882
and she recited `` hector ' s farewell to andromache ' ' most movingly , to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown near philadelphia , where the szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds ' in baltimore .	1468.8499
adele , like amy , the youngest of the marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .	755.41797
for rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular march counterpart	937.7715
but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian .	1242.603
the szolds , like the marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times	2162.0437
and , as in the march home , any young man who called on the szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them .	595.3774
this included mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as papa had first fallen in love with her mamma before he chose her	597.43207
and when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed the szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the szold girls and mamma .	499.37433
and just as `` laurie ' ' lawrence was first attracted to bright jo march , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister amy , so joe jastrow , who had also been writing henrietta before he came to johns hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty rachel .	975.4104
and like jo march , who saw her sisters meg and amy involved in `` lovering ' ' before herself , henrietta saw her sisters rachel and sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , rachel by joe jastrow , and sadie by max lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the mississippi .	1334.3835
this time he was making no mistake .	836.61017
olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart .	1397.3888
no wonder wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met .	2188.7947
almost from that day , until his death , olgivanna was to stay at his side	348.6727
but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for wright and his montenegrin lady .	1238.8156
it must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval .	602.5337
even so , many of the things that happened to wright and olgivanna seem inordinately severe .	895.7034
their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for .	2892.421
reporters began to trail miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make appalling statements about wright and his doings .	768.43085
flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air .	564.00006
the distracted miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person .	494.12277
at last her lawyer , arthur d . cloud , gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged .	608.85065
cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client `` i wanted to be a lawyer , and mrs . wright wanted me to be an avenging angel .	425.6701
the first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case .	605.4133
but every time i suggested this to her , mrs . wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and punish mr . wright .	302.87674
i am an attorney , not an instrument of vengeance ' ' .	71.822556
miriam noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor , and appointed a heavy-faced young man named harold jackson to take his place .	1355.7997
there were three years of this strange warfare	428.21408
and during the unhappy time , miriam often would charge that wright and olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of wisconsin .	1153.4269
yet somehow , when officers were prodded into visiting taliesin to execute the warrants , they would find neither wright nor olgivanna at home .	1790.9115
this showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle .	1024.0967
the misery of miriam ' s bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain .	834.0593
to get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon wright and olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by miriam in person .	672.2399
one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at spring green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in june .	380.79593
at this time miriam noel appeared , urging on constable henry pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the welsh settlers in the neighborhood .	1450.408
a troop of reporters brought up the rear .	316.11267
miriam was stopped at the taliesin gate , and william weston , now the estate foreman , came out to parley .	571.2745
he said that mr . wright was not in , and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that miriam was waving in the air .	324.73532
miriam now ordered pengally to break down the gate , but he said he really couldn ' t go that far .	86.95516
at this point mrs . frances cupply , one of wright ' s handsome daughters by his first wife , came from the house and tried to calm miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock .	867.6435
miriam noel wright said , `` here i am at my own home , locked out so i must stand in the road ' ' ! !	130.66936
then she rounded on weston and cried , `` you always did wright ' s dirty work ! !	390.9025
when i take over taliesin , the first thing i ' ll do is fire you ' ' .	107.33689
`` madame noel , i think you had better go ' ' , said mrs . cupply .	159.31377
`` and i think you had better leave ' ' , replied miriam .	277.92184
turning to the reporters , she asked , `` did you hear her ? ?	143.44312
' i think you had better leave ' ! !	2403.642
and this is my own home ' ' .	43.065956
in the silence that followed , miriam walked close to mrs . cupply , who drew back a step on her side of the gate .	308.62698
then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , miriam said to the young woman , `` you are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly .	439.8251
you are even uglier than mr . wright ' ' .	11.496398
the animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force	531.5716
and it gave miriam noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art .	473.78775
as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him	800.9317
she also went to washington and appealed to senator george william norris of nebraska , the fighting liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard .	3745.6685
then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , miriam gave a ghastly echo of mrs . micawber by suddenly stating , `` i will never leave mr . wright ' ' .	346.79272
under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers .	580.4039
miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in wright ' s remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole .	277.25934
first , wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town .	887.27295
but surely michigan avenue was handsome ? ?	359.22067
`` that isn ' t a boulevard , it ' s a racetrack ' ' ! !	63.610107
cried wright , showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the 1920 ' s .	223.52429
`` this is a horrible way to live ' ' , wright went on .	196.57875
`` you are being strangled by traffic ' ' .	121.798805
he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty , and began to talk trenchant sense , though private anguish showed through in the vehemence of his manner .	496.0579
`` take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the loop ' ' , wright said .	305.9586
`` cut off every building at the seventh floor .	315.37405
if you cut down these horrible buildings you ' ll have no more traffic jams .	1309.9752
you ' ll have some joy in the life of this city .	99.88439
after all , that ' s the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy ' ' .	87.6685
little enough joy was afforded wright in the spring of 1925 , when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin .	807.60474
the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning , as though miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the old testament .	781.7886
a storm did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames .	597.4577
later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire	2038.8661
at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes , and fused the k ' ang-si pottery to cinders .	1112.0361
wright set his loss at $200 , 000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed .	351.9438
in spite of the disaster , wright completed during this period plans for the lake tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of american indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing .	697.0146
amid a shortage of profitable work , the memory of albert johnson ' s $20 , 000 stood out in lonely grandeur -- the money had quickly melted away .	753.3866
a series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time	505.89725
and the question before these meetings was , here is a man of international reputation and proved earning power	544.7767
how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? ?	205.05153
while this was under consideration , dauntless as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3 .	911.38306
as he made plans for the new taliesin , wright also got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation of all faiths , and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp .	621.7034
years were to pass before these plans came off the paper , and wright was justified in thinking , as the projects failed , that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to taliesin .	311.53488
and now there was some question as to his continued residence there .	535.1655
billy koch , who had once worked for wright as a chauffeur , gave a deposition for miriam ' s use that he had seen olgivanna living at taliesin .	581.5957
this might put wright in such a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin	758.6299
nor was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he was not `` compelled to spend money on useless lawyer ' s bills , useless hotel bills , and useless doctor ' s bills ' ' , he could more quickly provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris , as she preferred .	499.64206
miriam sniffed at this , and complained that wright had said unkind things about her to reporters .	803.7625
his reply was , `` everything that has been printed derogatory to you , purporting to have come from me , was a betrayal , and nothing yet has been printed which i have sanctioned ' ' .	482.88824
what irritated miriam was that wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made , which he considered she would accept `` when she tires of publicity ' ' .	316.85428
from her california headquarters , miriam fired back , `` i shall never divorce mr . wright , to permit him to marry olga milanoff ' ' .	379.84094
then miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending , and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty , with the understanding that wright would not contest it .	1008.3527
the bank of wisconsin sent a representative to the judge ' s chambers in madison to give information on wright ' s ability to meet the terms .	257.68045
he said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end , and that the bank would accept a mortgage on taliesin to help bring this about .	650.7714
miriam said that she must be assured that `` that other woman , olga , will not be in luxury while i am scraping along ' ' .	395.8369
this exhausted wright ' s patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite .	554.01465
`` volstead laws , speed laws , divorce laws ' ' , he said , `` as they now stand , demoralize the individual , make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another , and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd .	775.5357
if mrs . wright doesn ' t accept the terms in the morning , i ' ll go either to tokyo or to holland , to do what i can .	159.21307
i realize , in taking this stand , just what it means to me and mine ' ' .	147.04889
here wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , `` it means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me ' ' .	495.444
next day , word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce	652.8352
but wright stayed in the united states .	14.4946995
his mentioning of japan and holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking .	637.868
no matter what troubles might betide him , this most american of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land .	1035.7856
in a few weeks miriam made another sortie at taliesin , but was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates .	1792.5894
more likely , you simply told yourself , as you handed us the book , that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation .	1705.5277
for pride ' s sake , i will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul .	1044.0128
besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood .	2208.697
but what you could not know , of course , was how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald was to lead into an american fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , taut semblance of it .	883.33435
i do not suppose you ever heard of f . scott fitzgerald , living or dead , and moreover i do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval .	330.93765
neither his appetites , his exacerbations , nor his despair were kin to yours .	3349.849
he might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him .	155.68443
but he was no man in the moon to me .	103.32736
although his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of , nor was it for yachts , sports cars , tall drinks , and swimming pools , nor yet for money or what money buys that i burned , i too was burning and watching myself burn .	1209.5266
the flame was simply of a different kind .	183.16331
it was symbolized ( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image ) by that self-consuming , elegiac candle of edna st . vincent millay ' s , that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a beacon to us , but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral taper to last even the evening , let alone the night .	683.3242
one should not , of course , pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume to linger on .	884.1388
yet this passion for passion , now that i look back on it with passion spent , seems somewhat overblown and operatic , though as a diva miss millay perfectly controlled her notes .	2385.3691
only what else was she singing but the old song of songs , that most ancient of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves ? ?	2148.9666
perhaps this is not so little .	405.28424
perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ? ?	435.56638
one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend	1326.071
one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul .	475.8796
but it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum .	131.78235
one could see this chemical determinant as in itself a miracle .	1924.8741
in any case , miss millay ' s sweet-throated bitterness , her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love , her constant and wonderfully tragic posture , so unlike that of fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props , drew from the me that i was when i fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea .	1023.4294
but all this , i am well aware , is the bel canto of love , and although i have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that i listened , i know well enough that it was not .	251.4194
if i am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love , i will have to stop trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale .	661.8027
there is another side of love , more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie , or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug .	1120.2524
whether you experienced the passion of desire i have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have i wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one ' s mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one ' s parents ' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger .	552.64264
i recoil from the very thought .	651.3476
at the same time , i am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox if one hates , they say it is because one loves	552.33496
if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid	195.46597
if one shuns , they say it is because one desires	169.87228
and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite .	650.4193
well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ?	2359.3115
) , i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion .	200.22473
you probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as i , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the farm .	674.6777
we had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .	1652.6216
we had stopped before a shop window to assess its autumnal display , when you suddenly turned to me , looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats , and with your nervous `` ahem ' ' ! !	930.98584
said `` there are things i must tell you about this man you are marrying which he does not know himself ' ' .	309.69992
if you had screamed right there in the street where we stood , i could not have felt more fear .	175.0807
with scarcely a mumble of excuse , i fled .	125.9001
i fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word `` things ' ' -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which i had already insisted upon finding out for myself ( despite , i may now say , the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood ) because i was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize life by the throat .	438.36597
i had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .	4136.07
what i fled from was my fear of what , unwittingly , you might betray , without meaning to , about my father and yourself .	712.9891
but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will .	600.3226
while my memory holds with relentless tenacity , as i cannot too often stress , to my wrongs , when it comes to my shames , it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them .	1234.3008
just as i was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside of the leaf of love , memory , displeased at being asked to yield its unsavory secrets , dashed ahead of me , calling back over its shoulder `` skip it .	925.31696
but i will not skip it or cut it out .	1821.04
it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings of chance .	959.6806
if to be innocent is to be helpless , then i had been -- as are we all -- helpless at the start .	175.52345
but the time came when i was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless .	633.3898
helpless in that sense i can never be again .	109.499344
however , i confess my hope that i will be innocent again , not with a pristine , accidental innocence , but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone .	435.60812
for innocence , of all the graces of the spirit , is i believe the one most to be prayed for .	188.43082
although it is constantly made to look foolish ( too simple to come in out of the rain , people say , who have found in the innocent an impediment ) , it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks .	469.00427
it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best , and when they seem worst it overlooks them .	388.44293
to innocence , a word given is a word that will be kept .	249.33226
instinctively , innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by .	370.974
but when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust , innocence can falter , since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it .	464.9479
the innocence of which i speak is , i know , not incorruptible .	277.23697
but i insist upon believing that even when it is lost , it may , like paradise , be regained .	538.26404
however , it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking , but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love .	663.8954
here , if anywhere , it is not wholly incontrovertible .	514.9234
to you , for instance , the word innocence , in this connotation , probably retained its biblical , or should i say technical sense , and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear by saying that i lost -- or rather handed over -- what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was legally entitled , and in fact by oath required , to hand it over along with what other goods and bads i had .	518.30383
but to me innocence is far less tangible .	578.7416
i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my trust in you , but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved , through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing , nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking , let alone with love .	813.33514
i knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time i acquired it	1689.1394
today , these many years later , after all the temptations resisted or yielded to , the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured , i call it corrupting still .	2413.807
you , i could swear to it , remained innocent in this sense until the end .	272.24475
yours , but not mine , was an age in which innocence was fostered and carefully -- if not perhaps altogether innocently -- preserved .	1504.7678
you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across her face .	1437.0739
moreover , because of the particular blot on your family escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your grandmother ' s part , and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle bed of your childhood to outgrow , what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person , what you bent your whole will , sensibility , and intelligence upon , was to be a lady .	1022.3885
before being daughter , wife , or mother , before being cultured ( a word now bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen bestowed on it ) , before being sorry for the poor , progressive about public health , and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian , indeed first and foremost , you were a lady .	2203.6382
there was , of course , more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind ' s eye than the sine qua non of her virtue .	446.2991
a lady , you made clear to me both by precept and example , never raised her voice or slumped in her chair , never failed in social tact ( in heaven , for instance , would not mention st . john the baptist ' s head ) , never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company , never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture , never indulged in public scenes or private confidences , never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering , never gossiped or maligned , never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself .	1188.5872
with each song he gave verbal footnotes .	4145.911
the songs sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments .	2428.3948
often these listeners would refer sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties .	1330.5955
in due time sandburg was a walking thesaurus of american folk music .	1973.6461
after he had finished the first two volumes of his lincoln , sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him .	1087.997
he rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists .	2216.2668
the result was a collection of 280 songs , ballads , ditties , brought together from all regions of america , more than one hundred never before published the american songbag .	838.374
each song or ditty was prefaced by an author ' s note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the chorus and verses .	316.40417
the book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since .	724.00464
as sandburg said at the time `` it is as ancient as the medieval european ballads brought to the appalachian mountains , it is as modern as skyscrapers , the volstead act , and the latest oil well gusher ' ' .	534.9558
sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer .	2051.6682
two things contribute to his popularity .	215.64815
first , carl respects his audience and prepares his speeches carefully .	1716.3712
even when he is called upon for impromptu remarks , he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes .	1217.8092
he has his own system of shorthand , devised by abbreviations `` humility ' ' will be `` humly ' ' , `` with ' ' will be `` w ' ' , and `` that ' ' will be `` tt ' ' .	157.81497
the second reason for his popularity is his complete spontaneity with the guitar .	618.9348
it is a mistake , however , to imagine that sandburg uses the guitar as a prop .	392.49777
he is no dextrous-fingered college boy but rather a dedicated , humble , and bashful apostle of this instrument .	1703.8857
at age seventy-four , he became what he shyly terms a `` pupil ' ' of andres segovia , the great guitarist of the western world .	630.7108
it is not easy to become segovia ' s pupil .	213.3963
`` his fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help in disciplining them .	717.2447
i found that this precocious , grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught .	3514.5447
there has long existed a brotherly affection between us , thus i accepted him as my pupil .	2083.9277
just as in the case of every prodigy child , we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to show up in the future -- if he should master all the strenuous exercises i inflicted on him .	310.717
to play the guitar as he aspires will devour his three-fold energy as a historian , a poet and a singer .	980.4236
one cause of schopenhauer ' s pessimism was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar .	84.9114
i am certain that carl sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy .	520.50867
the heart of this great poet constantly bubbles forth a generous joy of life -- with or without the guitar ' ' .	1071.2184
the public ' s identification of carl sandburg and the guitar is no happenstance .	765.7606
nor does carl reject this identity .	177.17929
he is proud of having segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him titled `` the guitar ' ' .	358.4811
carl says it is the greatest poem ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem to that subtle instrument .	446.52344
`` a portable companion always ready to go where you go -- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant -- to be shared with few or many -- just two of you in sweet meditation ' ' .	1180.5742
the new york herald tribune ' s photographer , ira rosenberg , tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a picture of carl playing a guitar .	636.85986
mr . rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one .	175.77063
`` preferably ' ' , said carl , `` one battered and worn , such as might be found in a pawnshop ' ' .	250.18881
they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller of 1162 sixth avenue .	8627.531
`` mr . miller was in the shop ' ' , the herald tribune story related , `` but was reluctant to have anybody ' s picture taken inside , because his business was too ' confidential ' for pictures .	334.02914
`` but after introductions he asked ' carl sandburg ? ?	486.95227
`` he wanted mr . sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop , but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully .	469.7151
' kalamazoo guitars ' , he said , ' used by radio hillbilly singers .	495.64178
`` he chose one from mr . miller ' s window , a plain guitar with no fancy polish .	336.6389
while the picture was taken , mr . miller ' s disposition to be generous to mr . sandburg increased to the point where he advised , ' i won ' t even charge you the one dollar rental fee ' ' ' .	283.12738
when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to be a celebrity , carl said , `` a celebrity is a fellow who eats celery with celerity ' ' .	1014.0815
this has always been carl ' s attitude .	157.75996
lloyd lewis wrote that when he first knew carl in 1916 , sandburg was making $27 . 50 a week writing features for the day book and eating sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants .	2220.28
he walked home at night for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley .	288.8779
when fame came it changed sandburg only slightly .	1575.5017
lewis remembered another newspaperman asking , `` carl , have your ideas changed any since you got all these comforts ' ' ? ?	435.65033
carl thought the question over slowly and answered `` i know a starving man who is fed never remembers all the pangs of his starvation , i know that ' ' .	776.2875
that was all he said , lewis reports .	238.78224
that was all he had to say .	54.563354
in answer to a new york times query on what is fame ( `` thoughts on fame ' ' , october 23 , 1960 ) , carl said `` fame is a figment of a pigment .	688.76013
there never were two fames alike .	16239.159
one fame is precious and luminous	6259.7744
another is a bubble of a bauble ' ' .	144.06621
`` ah , did you once see shelley plain ' ' ? ?	400.0975
the impression you get from carl sandburg ' s home is one of laughter and happiness	726.41364
and the laughter and the happiness are even more pronounced when no company is present .	653.9247
carl has been married to paula for fifty-three years , and he has not made a single major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion with his wife .	527.8382
through all these years , mrs . sandburg has pointedly avoided the limelight .	1090.623
she has shared her husband ' s greatness , but only within the confines of their home	274.09647
it is a dedication which began the moment she met carl .	474.34634
mrs . sandburg received a phi beta kappa key from the university of chicago and she was busy writing and teaching when she met sandburg .	909.47906
`` you are the ' peoples ' poet ' ' ' was her appraisal in 1908 , and she stopped teaching and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husband ' s career .	239.6767
she has rarely been photographed with him and , except for carl ' s seventy-fifth anniversary celebration in chicago in 1953 , she has not attended the dozens of banquets , functions , public appearances , and dinners honoring him -- all of this upon her insistence .	729.3047
even now i will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts .	930.83716
the only way to describe paula sandburg is to say she is beautiful in a grecian sense .	441.78348
her clothes , her hair , everything about her is both graceful and simple .	734.4715
she has small , broad , capable hands and an enormous energy .	734.08984
she is not only a trained mathematician and classicist , but a good architect .	1295.4373
she designed and supervised the building of the harbert , michigan , house , most of which was constructed by one local carpenter who carried the heavy beams singly upon his shoulder .	618.6002
as the sandburg goat herd increased , she also designed the barn alterations to accommodate them .	1181.3784
when erosion threatened the foundation of their home in harbert , paula sandburg planted grapevines and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the sands away .	2740.523
she was born lilian steichen , her parents immigrants from luxemburg .	2172.2473
her mother called her paus ' l , a luxemburg endearment meaning `` pussycat ' ' .	2085.5212
some of the children of the family could not pronounce this name and called her paula , a soubriquet carl liked so much she has been paula ever since .	965.8691
but neither was lilian her baptismal name .	10422.055
her parents , pious roman catholics , christened her mary anne elizabeth magdalene steichen .	7583.464
`` my mother read a book right after i was born and there was a lilian in the book she loved and i became lilian -- and eventually i became paula ' ' .	367.87125
lilian steichen was an exceptional student .	1071.9446
this family of luxemburg immigrants , in fact , produced two exceptional children .	438.1534
paula ' s older brother is edward steichen , a talented artist and , for the past half-century , one of the world ' s eminent photographers .	394.18958
( two years ago the photography editor of vogue magazine titled his article about steichen , `` the world ' s greatest photographer ' ' .	495.88553
by the time lilian had been graduated from public school , her parents were doing quite well .	596.4887
her mother was a good manager and established a millinery business in milwaukee .	2032.5004
but her father was not enthusiastic about sending young paula to high school .	639.2101
`` this is no place for a young girl ' ' , he said .	64.93743
the parents compromised , however , on a convent school and paula went to ursuline academy in london , ontario .	759.7895
she was pious , too , once kneeling through the night from holy thursday to good friday , despite the protest of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl .	598.7151
she knelt out of reverence for having read the meditations of st . augustine .	895.64874
she read everything else she could get her hands on , including an article ( she thinks it was in the atlantic monthly ) by mark twain on `` white slavery ' ' .	404.4842
paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in chapel .	1130.635
she had come to a decision .	113.144775
if there was ever a thought in her mind she might devote her life to religion , it was now dispelled .	557.0823
`` i felt that i must devote myself to the ' outside ' world ' ' .	100.14516
she passed the entrance examinations to the university of illinois , but during the year at urbana felt more important events transpired at the university of chicago .	774.83704
`` and besides , thorstein veblen was one of the chicago professors ' ' .	886.0139
at the university of chicago she studied whitman and shelley , and became a socialist .	1114.6991
socialist leaders in milwaukee recognized her worth , not only because of her dedication but because of her fluency in german , french , and luxemburg .	687.00397
she once gave a german recitation before a convention of german-language teachers in milwaukee .	2999.4282
carl and paula met in milwaukee in 1907 during paula ' s christmas holiday visit to her parents .	1024.9136
carl was still charles a . sandburg .	95.41048
he `` legitimized ' ' paula for lilian steichen , and it was paula who insisted on carl for charles .	745.88116
victor berger , the panjandrum of wisconsin socialism and member of congress , had asked paula steichen to translate some of his german editorials into english .	1567.4022
carl , who was stationed in appleton , wisconsin , organizing for the social democrats , was in berger ' s office and made it his business to escort paula to the streetcar .	886.6927
she left the next day for her teaching job at princeton , illinois .	605.53
( after graduation from the university of chicago , paula taught for two years in the normal school at valley city , north dakota , then two years at princeton ( illinois ) township high school .	566.2747
) by the time the streetcar pulled away , he had fallen in love with paula .	460.06845
a letter awaited her at princeton .	1065.7856
paula says that even though carl ' s letters usually began , `` dear miss steichen ' ' , there was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband and wife .	221.27313
paula generously lent me one of carl ' s love letters , dated february 21 , 1908 , hotel athearn , oshkosh , wisconsin	2022.0862
`` dear miss steichen it is a very good letter you send me -- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare i am carrying on up here .	952.363
never until in this work of s-d organization have i realized and felt the attitude and experience of a teacher .	458.437
the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice .	387.08005
certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the united states has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation	277.77225
by the same token , we reject any soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force or subversion .	1238.2787
now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort .	572.69714
not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries	974.34534
we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them .	645.44476
we and our friends are , of course , concerned with self-defense .	229.22636
growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress , in freedom , of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations .	257.00894
these peoples , desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not , by our neglect , be forced to seek help from , and finally become virtual satellites of , those who proclaim their hostility to freedom .	910.4514
but they must have technical and investment assistance .	6922.4395
this is a problem to be solved not by america alone , but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help .	566.5402
in recent years america ' s partners and friends in western europe and japan have made great economic progress .	367.1808
the international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the early postwar years .	563.86694
no longer is the united states the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries .	512.78015
to remain secure and prosperous themselves , wealthy nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope , confidence , and progress .	832.8178
a rich nation can for a time , without noticeable damage to itself , pursue a course of self-indulgence , making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens -- thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nations .	1474.5685
but the enmities it will incur , the isolation into which it will descend , and the internal moral and spiritual softness that will be engendered , will , in the long term , bring it to economic and political disaster .	445.66495
america did not become great through softness and self-indulgence .	2885.3267
her miraculous progress in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy and substantial adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious philosophy	3329.529
a satisfaction in hard work	1328.4546
the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes	2651.965
the courage to meet every challenge	6671.138
the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own best interests .	416.34796
to us and to every nation of the free world , rich or poor , these qualities are necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater security , prosperity and peace .	456.63467
i believe that the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing nations to achieve progress .	529.30054
the immediate need for this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation ' s international balance of payments .	371.52332
our surplus from foreign business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas , to finance private investment , and to provide assistance to the less developed nations .	1036.035
in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments approached four billion dollars .	956.4361
continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would , over time , impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world .	519.10376
we must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade .	583.54364
further , we must induce all industrialized nations of the free world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate .	903.9966
this co-operation in this matter will provide both for the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further increases in mutually profitable trade .	638.63855
new nations , and others struggling with the problems of development , will progress only -- regardless of any outside help -- if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it .	1194.0616
moreover , progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned	750.9642
there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane .	435.8627
but , just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years , so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help .	1023.6368
respecting their need , one of the major focal points of our concern is the south-asian region .	465.4381
here , in two nations alone , are almost five hundred million people , all working , and working hard , to raise their standards , and in doing so , to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty .	393.49377
i cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that , in our own and free world interest , we must co-operate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions , as expressed in their different multi-year plans .	642.7121
through the world bank and other instrumentalities , as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help , we must squarely face this titanic challenge .	1163.0427
i shall continue to urge the american people , in the interests of their own security , prosperity and peace , to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully supported .	397.55734
free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom .	758.1121
other countries , some of which i visited last month , have similar needs .	243.18304
a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort .	291.95343
during the past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western nations .	249.40457
because of its wealth of experience , the organization for european economic cooperation could help with the initial studies needed .	337.83014
the goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized free world , especially private investment capital .	1259.4052
by extending this help , we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom ' s banner .	302.16168
no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined .	569.5669
if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic advancement , we will make brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom .	543.211
otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed .	292.88303
we face , indeed , what may be a turning point in history , and we must act decisively and wisely .	276.1518
as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength .	1091.6085
no matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction .	487.84775
until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions .	1232.4817
america possesses an enormous defense power .	448.11316
it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support .	1029.564
it is world-wide knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack the united states by surprise , even though we might sustain great losses , would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction .	496.93152
but i once again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states , except in defense , will never turn loose this destructive power .	321.48077
during the past year , our long-range striking power , unmatched today in manned bombers , has taken on new strength as the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory .	1209.2711
in fourteen recent test launchings , at ranges of five thousand miles , atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target .	1007.90857
this is less than the length of a jet runway -- well within the circle of destruction .	351.48343
incidentally , there was an atlas firing last night .	743.5322
from all reports so far received , its performance conformed to the high standards i have just described .	712.59076
such performance is a great tribute to american scientists and engineers , who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles , where america had none before .	665.75116
this year , moreover , growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will enter our active forces , some to be armed with polaris missiles .	924.68085
these remarkable ships and weapons , ranging the oceans , will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth .	985.6868
to meet situations of less than general nuclear war , we continue to maintain our carrier forces , our many service units abroad , our always ready army strategic forces and marine corps divisions , and the civilian components .	1100.2887
the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process .	513.2308
it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength .	643.13794
the deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores , on land and sea , is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security .	720.22565
moreover , i have directed that steps be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to these allies .	1245.9576
this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system .	963.84564
next i refer to our program in space exploration , which is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development .	476.23376
we note that , first , america has already made great contributions in the past two years to the world ' s fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science .	306.69357
these discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community	1571.1316
but they are important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind .	652.5911
second , our military missile program , going forward so successfully , does not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines , which are necessary in distant space exploration .	788.54535
i am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements .	638.4961
third , the united states is pressing forward in the development of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes .	492.72427
fourth , in the meantime , it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth .	226.3528
using launch systems presently available , we are developing satellites to scout the world ' s weather	675.59515
satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe	2191.4902
for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft	2333.557
and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek .	886.4948
fifth , we have just completed a year ' s experience with our new space law .	290.22272
i believe it deficient in certain particulars .	709.0146
suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly .	506.05624
the accomplishment of the many tasks i have alluded to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual , intellectual , and economic sinews of american life .	1170.0115
the steady purpose of our society is to assure justice , before god , for every individual .	268.4294
we must be ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the issues of the day .	915.0911
a year ago , when i met with you , the nation was emerging from an economic downturn , even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful .	601.75665
today our surging strength is apparent to everyone .	285.0912
1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our history .	342.74283
yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders .	1712.3059
among current problems that require solutions , participated in by citizens as well as government , are	789.24426
the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate	3206.591
the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture	386.52322
the continuing threat of inflation , together with the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility	8911.896
in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law .	225.81711
the group , upon the issuance of its first press release on december 21 , 1957 , designated itself a `` committee of investigation ' ' .	303.1267
in the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses .	406.0822
it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer , adolf a . berle , jr . , once .	306.65863
its second press release was on january 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed .	356.06894
it also implied that paul bang-jensen had been irresponsible .	1198.8607
on january 18 , ernest gross conducted a press conference at the u . n . lasting an hour .	307.39108
here , he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct ' ' .	392.1285
this conference was held despite stavropoulos ' assurance to adolf berle , who was leaving the same day for puerto rico , that nothing would be done until his return on january 22 , except that the secretary general would probably order the list destroyed .	652.8
on january 24 paul bang-jensen , accompanied by adolf berle , was met by dragoslav protitch and colonel frank begley , former police chief of farmington , conn . , and now head of u . n . special police .	843.2775
the four , bundled in overcoats , mounted to the wind-swept roof of the u . n .	201.17964
there , begley lit a fire in a wire basket , and bang-jensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames .	1282.612
in one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eighty-one refugees .	677.3196
the method of destroying the evidence embarrassed paul bang-jensen .	9971.955
he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence .	116.75575
he was right , and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordier ' s words on the subject , `` well , it seemed as good a place as any to do the job ' ' .	294.26205
the gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the secretary general .	567.3153
hammarskjold ' s supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of ernest gross is illusion , at best .	1358.2516
gross ' s , being `` outside ' ' the u . n . applied only to a physical state , not an objective one .	146.51045
but by the time the papers were finally disposed of , the group had informed the world of its purpose , its recommendations , and its belief that paul bang-jensen was not of sound mind .	340.1023
shortly the group would issue its report to the secretary general , recommending paul bang-jensen ' s dismissal from the united nations .	300.40082
the contents of this 195-page document would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about .	690.74835
`` until this hungarian committee matter came up , bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual .	759.8989
i had known him for some years , when i was a delegate and before , and this manner had never been his ' ' .	108.253105
ernest a . gross leaned back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general dag hammarskjold had , on december 4 , 1957 , called him in as a private lawyer to review bang-jensen ' s conduct `` relating to his association with the special committee on the problem of hungary ' ' .	546.7782
the result was the `` gross report ' ' , prepared by gross , as chairman , with the assistance of two u . n . under secretaries , constantin stavropoulos and philippe de seynes .	394.30368
`` yes ' ' , gross went on , `` bang-jensen was an up-and-coming young man .	992.8489
never well known , but he had done his work competently .	412.5624
gross had received marshall courteously and they were discussing the case .	843.181
`` you know ' ' , the lawyer said , `` it ' s difficult to talk like this about a man who can ' t answer back ' ' .	82.75157
gross was behind a clean-top desk , only a manila folder before him .	5107.2427
marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs .	393.0323
outside the office windows , twenty-four stories above wall street , a light rain was falling .	741.94025
`` mr . gross , your report says that ' our function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate from or prejudice mr . bang-jensen ' s rights as a staff member .	766.3151
you know , bang-jensen characterized your committee as having prejudged his case ' ' .	665.9744
`` well , how could that have been ? ?	173.0477
i don ' t consider that he was prejudged .	277.1471
we were given a job and we carried it out , and later , his case was taken up by the disciplinary committee .	505.97205
`` we have nothing to hide under a bushel .	2255.7197
we did our job , mr . stavropoulos and mr . de seynes and myself , taking evidence from a number of people ' ' .	81.93253
`` what did you think about his mental state ' ' ? ?	73.24576
`` i think our report sums up our finding ' ' , gross answered .	898.4423
`` don ' t forget , here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report .	724.67755
`` this was not merely alleging errors , but was carried out by day-after-day allegations in memos , written charges of serious consequence .	1901.9552
`` this is a distressing thing .	1015.95996
supposing you or i were being accused in this manner , and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work .	282.6825
no organization can carry on like that .	497.56076
`` i ' ve been in government and i can tell some pretty hairy stories about personnel difficulties , so i know what a problem he was ' ' .	369.4037
`` what i ' d like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your committee ' ' .	632.1322
`` what do you mean ' ' ? ?	10.672619
`` for instance , regarding the fact that the gross committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation .	681.064
you know bang-jensen was told the committee was ' to convey its views , suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general .	473.48666
in his own words , bang-jensen ' took it for granted that the group would report to the secretary general privately and not in public .	469.4739
he claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was ' prejudicial to his position ' ' ' .	157.40614
for an instant he glared speechless at marshall .	24685.275
`` listen ' ' , he said .	16.083654
`` i thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end .	541.014
but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press .	458.86215
it was getting so that we , the committee , were being tried .	380.63474
you can find it in the papers ' ' .	24.773966
`` well , as a matter of fact , i ' ve looked through back-issue files of new york papers for december , 1957 , and haven ' t found a great deal ' ' --	259.06226
gross shot another look at marshall .	482.09634
`` it wasn ' t necessarily all here in new york .	205.64764
don ' t forget the foreign press ' ' .	78.474625
`` then what about the second interim public announcement ? ?	373.00354
this cited bang-jensen ' s ' aberrant conduct ' ' ' .	168.83614
`` the reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list .	151.32765
as far as i ' m concerned , it was a separate matter from the general committee study of bang-jensen ' s conduct .	214.94246
the january fifteen report recommended that bang-jensen be instructed to burn the list -- the papers -- in the presence of a u . n . security officer ' ' .	208.59329
`` how about your press conference three days later -- what was the reason for that ? ?	386.9557
bang-jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance to make sure the term ' aberrant conduct ' was not libelous .	1222.1058
he claimed you made other slanderous allegations ' ' .	1104.1448
`` the entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list , since many in the press were querying the u . n . about it .	151.55482
bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession .	198.12044
`` it was foolish of him to keep them , whatever they were .	132.82625
he could have been blackmailed , or his family might have been threatened .	722.38806
of course the matter caught the public ' s attention .	201.10895
we attempted to conclude this , and did so by having the papers burned .	436.59735
hammarskjold didn ' t like the way it was carried out .	128.12488
it was a sort of gotterdammerung affair .	6103.2783
hammarskjold believes the u . n . is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way .	218.19044
if hammarskjold had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner , and if bang-jensen had not wanted it -- who had ordered it ? ?	364.56543
`` mr . gross , concerning the formation of your committee , there ' s the fact that you have been a legal adviser to the u . n . in the past	110.805725
as i understand it , mr . hammarskjold wanted outside advice .	208.28548
could you comment on that ' ' ? ?	14.558208
`` i ' ve served as a counsel for the u . n . for some years , specializing particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular u . n . legal staff might not be equipped to handle .	220.01732
mr . stavropoulos is the u . n . legal chief and a very good man , but he is not fully versed on some technical points of american law ' ' .	140.6491
`` what did you think about bang-jensen ' s contention of errors and omissions in the hungarian report ' ' ? ?	292.4023
`` why , mick shann went over and over the report with alsing andersen , trying to check them out .	1233.7694
even after the incident between bang-jensen and shann in the delegates ' lounge and this was not the way the chicago tribune presented it ' ' .	389.09216
gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings .	2197.3362
one was an article on the u . n . by alice widener from the cincinnati enquirer .	480.26514
the other was by chesly manley in the chicago daily tribune .	2941.253
gross pointed to the manley story .	1027.1876
`` i know ches , he ' s a friend of mine .	75.47295
he probably didn ' t mean to write it this way , or maybe he did .	167.42099
there wasn ' t any ' violent argument ' between bang-jensen and shann , as the tribune puts it .	856.0664
that implies that shann was on the enemy side .	111.24875
you see what i mean ? ?	48.04808
how it ' s phrased there -- the word violent .	1745.3813
`` the case was that bang-jensen came up to shann claiming he had found further errors in the report .	593.7067
' i ' ve found errors and i want you to look them over .	408.11148
so once again shann had to argue with him about this .	284.42044
but it wasn ' t a violent discussion .	132.06052
and after all this , shann went over all that bang-jensen had brought up ' ' .	289.68832
( shann ' s own report , peter marshall reflected , describes the encounter as `` immoderate ' ' .	775.5357
bang-jensen was in `` hysterical condition ' ' .	140.0576
gross stopped briefly , then went on .	255.93434
`` shann was responsible for the report .	40.64044
he has felt terrible about all this .	208.62224
it was a good report , he did all he could to make it a good report .	185.5813
when i speak of how shann felt , i know well .	412.6281
don ' t forget , i am an old member of the club , a former delegate .	159.13733
i think you are being unfair to take these things up now .	616.0467
`` you know , this hits in many areas .	223.0586
it appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the hungarian situation .	244.83713
don ' t forget , the u . n . did no more than the united states did .	66.30206
it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact ' ' .	135.08083
from the home of his friend , henrik kauffmann , in washington , d . c . , paul bang-jensen sent a telegram dated december 9 , 1957 , to ernest gross .	554.4758
`` the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character , and i therefore respectfully request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that i might make adequate preparation ' ' .	413.19202
ernest gross replied the next day , putting the suspended diplomat ' s fears to rest .	465.60327
`` this reveals some misunderstanding on your part .	369.1922
the group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings .	1233.3447
it wished to pursue , in the course of this review , questions arising from the body of material already in its possession .	212.30171
it sounded like a fair enough invitation , peter marshall reflected , and bang-jensen must have thought so too , because on the thirteenth , he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth floor of the u . n . .	287.7152
there , ernest gross further assured him	2153.8313
`` we were requested by the secretary general , as i understand it , to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant , and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat .	215.65298
the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those of common sense , justice , and fairness ' ' .	158.87407
peter marshall noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with the gross group as `` unfortunate experiences ' ' , and after his second meeting on the sixteenth the dane refused to attend further hearings without legal counsel .	559.40607
marshall pondered the reason for this , and pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group .	299.79507
j . a . c . robertson , after serving gross one week , left for england .	537.9189
fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged .	2292.4604
another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage .	731.0731
the sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon .	268.61365
the only lasting difficulty was the food .	127.55625
in spite of pickering dodge ' s explicit instructions regarding variation of meals , the food did not seem the same as at home .	597.8501
`` everything tasted differently from what it does on land and those things i was most fond of at home , i loathed the most here ' ' , ann noted .	311.28796
at last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise .	461.01364
walking was the remedy , they decided , but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable .	1399.654
a rope was found and , like children in school , the missionaries skipped for hours at a time .	318.91708
finally , tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead .	564.22736
it was much more fun , reminding the girls of their old carefree days in the hasseltine frolics room at bradford .	1736.219
the weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites , although harriet was still a little off-color .	1501.2703
she could not face coffee or tea without milk , and was always craving types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship .	1814.0286
by now she was sure she was going to have a baby , deciding it would be born in india or burma that november .	346.3774
she was more excited than frightened at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land .	295.0435
the crew of the caravan never failed to amaze ann , who during her stay in salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language .	3041.1294
she wrote in her journal , `` i have not heard the least profane language since i have been on board the vessel .	733.20447
she was now enjoying the voyage very much .	876.3181
even the first wave of homesickness had passed , although there were moments when captain heard pointed out on his compass the direction of bradford that she felt a little twinge at her heart .	1068.3273
as for adoniram , she found him to be `` the kindest ' ' of husbands .	394.24973
on sundays , with the permission of captain heard , who usually attended with two of his officers , services were held in the double cabin .	472.3184
sometimes a ship would be sighted and the caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck .	444.78156
captain heard did not communicate with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united states and britain .	241.87128
as warmer temperatures were encountered ann and harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt water .	1471.1328
when may came the caravan had already crossed the equator .	26010.41
they were sailing round the cape of good hope	749.0169
the weather had turned wet and cold .	783.1849
at this time harriet wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother	816.60333
`` i care not how soon we reach calcutta , and are placed in a still room , with a bowl of milk and a loaf of indian bread .	603.3211
i can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury .	1445.3832
i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel , and the almost intolerable smell after the rain , that i have done little more than lounge on the bed for several days .	393.35495
but i have been blest with excellent spirits , and to-day have been running about the deck , and dancing in our room for exercise , as well as ever ' ' .	357.58688
while studying at the seminary in andover , adoniram had been working on a new testament translation from the original greek .	1314.5355
he had brought it along to continue during the voyage .	1039.0872
there was one particular word that troubled his conscience .	982.16895
this was the greek word most often translated as `` baptism ' ' .	361.04248
born a congregationalist , he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water sprinkled on his head , yet nowhere in the whole of the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized by sprinkling .	568.746
john the baptist used total immersion in the river jordan for believers	5928.9194
even christ was baptized by this method .	120.493225
the more adoniram looked at the greek word for baptism , the more unhappy he became over its true meaning .	399.98248
as was only natural he confided his searchings to ann , conceding ruefully that it certainly looked as if their own congregationalists were wrong and the baptists right .	2990.5852
by this time she had learned that it was futile to argue with her young husband , yet the uncomfortable fact remained the american congregationalists were sending them as missionaries to the far east and paying their salaries .	656.68066
what would happen if adoniram `` changed horses in midstream ' ' ? ?	836.116
baptists and congregationalists in new england were on friendly terms .	579.69775
how embarrassing it would be if the newly appointed congregationalist missionaries should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist teachings ! !	1392.4486
`` if you become a baptist , i will not ' ' , ann informed her husband , but sweeping her threat aside adoniram continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he found himself .	677.96936
by early june they were a hundred miles off the coast of ceylon , by which time all four missionaries were hardened seafarers .	1142.8508
even harriet could boldly write , `` i know not how it is	139.97368
but i hear the thunder roll	40942.406
and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel	979.7609
ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two strange tropical birds .	1490.103
land was near , and on june 12 , one hundred and fourteen days after leaving america , they actually saw , twenty miles away , the coast of orissa .	421.03824
captain heard gave orders for the ship to be anchored in the bay of bengal until he could obtain the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters .	430.52002
sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but captain heard was lucky .	466.37918
next day a ship arrived with an english pilot , his leadsman , an english youth , and the first hindu the judsons and newells had ever seen .	1648.8905
a little man with a `` a dark copper color ' ' skin , he was wearing `` calico trousers and a white cotton short gown ' ' .	731.0633
ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance .	81.902306
`` he looks as feminine as you can imagine ' ' , she decided .	136.98447
the pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling	1167.5002
all day long the caravan slowly made her way through the difficult passages .	1229.9161
alas , to ann ' s consternation , his language while thus employed left much to be desired .	647.9361
he swore so loudly at the top of his voice , that she didn ' t get any sleep all the next night .	132.73051
next morning the caravan was out of the treacherous bay .	244.79193
relieved of the major part of his responsibility for the safety of the ship , the pilot ' s oaths became fewer .	215.44138
slowly she moved up the hooghli river , a mouth of the mighty ganges , toward calcutta .	1431.7627
ann was entranced with the view , as were her husband and friends .	215.87294
running across the deck , which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and eaten , they sniffed the spice-laden breezes that came from the shore , each pointing out new and exciting wonders to the other .	676.0628
out came the journal and in it went ann ' s own description of the scene	188.88402
`` on each side of the hoogli , where we are now sailing , are the hindoo cottages , as thick together as the houses in our seaports .	633.56134
they are very small , and in the form of haystacks , without either chimney or windows .	513.2102
they are situated in the midst of trees , which hang over them , and appear truly romantick .	1256.8142
the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green , and herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river , and the natives are scattered about differently employed .	657.95734
some are fishing , some driving the team , and many are sitting indolently on the banks of the river .	401.72012
the pagodas we have passed are much larger than the houses ' ' .	178.6046
where were the hardships she had expected ? ?	132.44121
she was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home in the big white house in haverhill .	440.2481
with childlike innocence she wrote of the indians as `` walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands , with the tawny children around them .	440.70157
this is the most delightful trial i have ever had ' ' , she decided .	109.350426
the indians who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly , even if she was suitably shocked , according to the customs of the society in which she had been reared , to find them `` naked , except a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle ' ' .	551.96136
at last they saw calcutta , largest city of bengal and the caravan ' s destination .	1393.9541
founded august 24 , 1690 by job charnock of the east india company , and commonly called `` the city of palaces ' ' , it seemed a vast and elegant place to ann hasseltine judson .	1959.6283
solid brick buildings painted dazzling white , large domes and tall , picturesque palms stretched as far as the eye could see , while the wharves and harbor were filled with tall-masted sailing ships .	1973.0522
crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their strange-sounding bengali tongue .	42266.56
harriet ' s mouth watered with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last to her much-craved milk and fresh bread .	3521.0964
ann , pleased to see her friend happy , was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of captain heard had sent on board for their enjoyment .	879.39606
cautiously she sampled her first pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of `` a rich pear ' ' .	897.89667
though she did not then know its name , this strange new fruit was a banana .	977.5928
the first act of adoniram and samuel on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station , a necessity when landing in east india company territory .	1495.3824
on the way they tried to discover all they could about burma , and they were disturbed to find that michael symes ' s book had not presented an altogether true picture .	782.9989
he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself .	773.884
they were in fact quietly laughing at him , for their king wished to have nothing to do with the western world .	349.3197
when captain john gibault of salem had visited burma in 1793 his ship , the astra , had been promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the irrawaddy river .	1594.2534
although after much trouble he did manage to get it back , he discovered there was no trade to be had .	194.36534
all captain gibault took back to salem were a few items for the town ' s east india museum .	524.24927
a year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy .	1347.1702
after that salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly burma .	2327.2207
the burmese appeared to have little knowledge of british power or any idea of trade .	302.3391
cruel burmese governors could , on the slightest whim , take a man ' s life .	197.62546
as for missionaries , even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the christian faith to the burmans .	554.3648
unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate .	875.61926
`` go back to america or any other place ' ' , well-meaning friends of captain heard advised them , `` but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads ' ' .	543.05505
somewhat daunted , the two american missionaries reached the police station where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk .	944.43994
when he discovered they had received from the company ' s court of directors no permission to live in india , coupled with the fact that they were americans who had been sent to asia to convert `` the heathen ' ' , he became more belligerent than ever .	249.68144
they explained that they desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could be found .	905.7998
she describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this `` unseasonable exultation ' '	1368.9391
he is answered by a confused , honest englishman .	791.05273
the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government , their delight at the prospect of a new war , their hopes of having the tories hanged , and so on .	495.39438
as for the author of the englishman , mrs . manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the protestant cause should be left to `` ridpath , dick steele , and their associates , with the apostles of young man ' s coffee-house ' ' .	430.45886
another controversy typical of the war between the englishman and the examiner centered on robert ( later viscount ) molesworth , a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish privy council .	683.59503
on december 21 , the day that the irish house of commons petitioned for removal of sir constantine phipps , their tory lord chancellor , molesworth reportedly made this remark on the defense of phipps by convocation `` they that have turned the world upside down , are come hither also ' ' .	1367.2957
upon complaints from the lower house of convocation to the house of lords , he was removed from the privy council , his remark having been represented as a blasphemous affront to the clergy .	637.425
steele , who had earlier praised molesworth in tatler no . 189 , now defended him in englishman no . 46 , depicting his removal as a setback to the constitution .	2372.2578
on the other hand , molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press .	1021.207
swift , in the dublin edition of a preface to the bishop of sarum ' s introduction , indicated his feelings by including molesworth , along with toland , tindal , and collins , in the group of those who , like burnet , are engaged in attacking all convocations of the clergy .	931.43036
in the same way he coupled molesworth and wharton in a letter to archbishop king , and he had earlier described him as `` the worst of them ' ' in some `` observations ' ' on the irish privy council submitted to oxford .	533.5425
a month later , in the publick spirit of the whigs , he used steele ' s defense of molesworth as evidence of his disrespect for the clergy , calling steele ' s position an affront to the `` whole convocation of ireland ' ' .	320.5839
on this issue , then , as on so many in these months , steele and swift took rigidly opposed points of view .	529.80505
in the early months of 1714 , the battle between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its major phase .	422.31885
the preliminaries ended with the publication of steele ' s crisis on january 19 , and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace .	345.38324
in answer to the crisis , swift produced the publick spirit of the whigs , his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend .	546.0695
by this time , as we shall see , the tories were already planning to `` punish ' ' steele for his political writing by expelling him from the house of commons .	531.5863
despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech before the house , their efforts were successful .	197.24069
steele lost his seat in parliament , and his personal quarrel with swift , by now a public issue , thus reached its climax .	379.0967
of all the whig tracts written in support of the succession , the crisis is perhaps the most significant .	501.3444
certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate .	2940.3413
hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation , said to have reached 40 , 000 , and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other government writers , the work must have had considerable impact .	388.18964
steele ' s main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a stuart restoration .	521.63495
to this end , the first and longest section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the revolution to defend england against the `` arbitrary power of a popish prince ' ' .	544.90344
in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes of current whig propaganda , ranging from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough	837.09576
but his principal theme is that the intrigues of the tories , `` our popish or jacobite party ' ' , pose an immediate threat to church and state .	410.86603
like burnet , he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis .	109.581924
treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession , he complains , are allowed to pass unnoticed .	588.1131
in this connection , swift , too , is drawn in for attack `` the author of the conduct of the allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession ' ' .	507.92307
in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy , steele goes so far as to list catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a stuart restoration , and , with rousing rhetoric , he asserts that the only preservation from these `` terrours ' ' is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited .	424.6856
`` it is no time ' ' , he writes , `` to talk with hints and innuendos , but openly and honestly to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put their designs in execution against us ' ' .	760.8118
steele apparently professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his own good , since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the house .	329.12396
in the final issues of the englishman , which ended just as the new session of parliament began , he provided his enemies with still more ammunition .	315.5461
for example , no . 56 printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke of cambridge .	2226.942
in a few months the duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant succession .	257.31454
at the order of the dowager electress , the hanoverian agents , supported by the whig leaders , demanded that a writ of summons be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in parliament , thus further insuring the succession by establishing a hanoverian prince in england before the queen ' s death .	841.7296
anne was furious , and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused .	1213.2314
oxford , realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ , took the opposite view , for which the queen never forgave him .	436.49954
accordingly the request was granted , but the elector himself , who had not been consulted by his mother , rejected the proposal and recalled his agent schutz , whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the hanoverian interest to suffer and had made oxford ' s dismissal more likely than ever .	826.9434
steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan .	565.32855
a few days after this englishman appeared , defoe reported to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the duke be called over	950.9894
defoe then commented , `` if they could draw that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves quickly , for they are not asham ' d to say they want only a head to make a beginning ' ' .	319.98813
the final issue of the englishman , no . 57 for february 15 , ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet , entitled the englishman being the close of the paper so-called .	721.8681
steele ' s purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which had occupied him in the englishman	296.92358
but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift .	978.4868
thus he complains , with considerable justice , that the tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments .	1340.0879
his birth , education , and fortune , he says , have all been ridiculed simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an englishman , and he assures the reader that `` whoever talks with me , is speaking to a gentleman born ' ' .	313.9542
as notable examples of this abuse , he quotes passages from the examiner , `` that destroyer of all things ' ' , and the character of richard steele , which he here attributes to swift .	394.3866
though put in rather maudlin terms , steele ' s defense of himself has a reasonable basis .	563.3574
his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal satire , despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of the sovereign .	794.1246
he claims , too , that his political convictions are simply those which are called `` revolution principles ' ' and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties .	335.37424
the final section of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of steele ' s relations with swift .	266.5384
it purports to be a letter from steele to a friend at court , who , in miss blanchard ' s opinion , could only be meant as swift .	341.85245
steele first answers briefly the charges which his `` dear old friend ' ' has made about his pamphlet on dunkirk and his crisis .	482.51102
then he launches into an attack on the tory ministers , whom he calls the `` new converts ' '	286.0531
by this term he means to ridicule their professions of acting in the interest of the church despite their own education and manner of life -- a gibe , in other words , at the `` presbyterianism ' ' in harley ' s family and at bolingbroke ' s reputed impiety .	507.44638
the tory leaders , he insinuates , are cynically using the church as a political `` by-word ' ' to increase party friction and keep themselves in power .	924.5068
this is the principal point made in this final section of englishman no . 57 , and it caps steele ' s efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the notion of the tories as a `` church party ' ' supported by the body of the clergy .	360.60135
next , steele turns his attention to the `` courtier ' ' he is addressing .	143.45468
he explains that there are sometimes honorable courtiers , but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice and ambition .	619.62225
such , he implies , is the case with his friend , who is not really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts .	450.33447
if `` jack the courtier ' ' is really to be taken as swift , the following remark is obviously steele ' s comment on swift ' s change of parties and its effect on their friendship `` i assure you , dear jack , when i first found out such an allay in you , as makes you of so malleable a constitution , that you may be worked into any form an artificer pleases , i foresaw i should not enjoy your favour much longer ' ' .	684.9073
he closes his `` letter ' ' by demanding that dunkirk be demolished , that the pretender be forced to move farther away from the coast of england , and that the queen and the house of hanover come to a better understanding .	451.6428
the last point was soon to be included in the `` seditious ' ' remarks used against him in parliament .	346.61465
the examiner , during steele ' s trial a month later , printed an answer from the `` courtier ' ' addressed to `` r . s . ' ' at button ' s coffee-house .	275.35223
he reviews steele ' s entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be credited to the indulgence of his friends .	615.3855
once more , in other words , steele is said to be indebted to swift for his `` wit ' '	246.43979
this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared in the tory press , especially the examiner .	796.69006
in the publick spirit of the whigs , it may be noted , swift himself contemptuously dismissed steele ' s reference to his friend at court `` i suppose by the style of old friend , and the like , it must be some body there of his own level	253.73239
among whom , his party have indeed more friends than i could wish ' ' .	714.71387
on february 16 , steele took his seat in parliament .	739.72424
by now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets , and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament .	1224.4442
on the very day that the parliamentary session began , another `` infamous libel ' ' appeared , entitled a letter from the facetious dr . andrew tripe , at bath , to the venerable nestor ironside .	1738.2783
it is filled with the usual personal abuse of steele , especially of his physical appearance	500.30746
in the opening paragraph , too , steele is accused of extreme egotism , of giving `` himself the preference to all the learned , his contemporaries , from dr . swift himself , even down to poet cr--spe of the customhouse ' ' .	459.2404
when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with johnny mercer , begun some years before .	343.3826
the film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled out of this world , a satire on the sinatra bobby-soxer craze .	2130.2942
the twist lay in using bing crosby ' s voice on the sound track while leading man eddie bracken mouthed the words .	2687.7317
if nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` out of this world ' ' and `` june comes around every year ' ' .	185.5598
though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on .	781.14545
early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled hot nocturne .	4066.4934
it purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians , their aims , their problems -- the tug-of-war between the `` pure ' ' and the `` commercial ' ' -- and seemed a promising vehicle , for the two men shared a common interest in jazz .	317.4082
johnny mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears .	191.33092
he was born in savannah , georgia , in 1909 .	295.91467
his father , george a . mercer , was descended from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one hugh mercer , who had emigrated from scotland in 1747 .	875.4001
the lyricist ' s father was a lawyer who had branched out into real estate .	989.5333
his second wife , lillian , was the mother of john h . mercer .	334.9319
by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the call .	419.92307
one day he followed the irish jasper greens , the town band , to a picnic and spent the entire day listening , while his family spent the day looking .	1127.8582
the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy .	946.2661
but one afternoon mrs . mercer met her	498.5516
both were obviously on the way to the mercer home .	115.2942
the mother inquired , `` where ' s johnny , and why did you leave him ' ' ? ?	131.11018
`` there was nothing else i could do ' ' , the maid answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation .	387.11993
the maid then told her , `` because he fired me ' ' .	244.72263
with her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music -- though she waited until he was ten -- beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet .	535.29517
young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments .	1677.4254
still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school , near orange , virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well .	1386.066
when he was fifteen john h . mercer turned out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called `` sister susie , strut your stuff ' ' .	969.31976
if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect .	583.55225
from his playmates in savannah , mercer had picked up , along with a soft southern dialect , traces also of the gullah dialects of africa .	1193.9045
such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language .	2027.5027
during the summers , while he was still in school , mercer worked for his father ' s firm as a messenger boy .	302.07785
it generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer ' s help .	166.70595
`` we ' d give him things to deliver , letters , checks , deeds and things like that ' ' , remembers his half-brother walter , still in the real estate business in savannah , `` and learn days later that he ' d absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket .	614.1469
this rather detached attitude toward life ' s encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in mercer ' s personality ever since .	531.4879
it is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not only has mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure .	803.41534
he has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman .	639.1488
he has also an extraordinary conscience .	948.8456
in 1927 his father ' s business collapsed , and , rather than go bankrupt , mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation .	891.49567
he died before he could completely pay off his debts .	583.67413
some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation received a check for $300 , 000 , enough to clear up the debt .	1104.3523
the check had been mailed from chicago , the envelope bore no return address , and the check was not signed .	472.8387
`` that ' s johnny ' ' , sighed the bank president , `` the best-hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded ' ' .	363.4185
but mercer ' s explanation was simple `` i made out the check and carried it around a few days unsigned -- in case i lost it ' ' .	530.9302
when he remembered that he might have not signed the check , mercer made out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other -- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly signed both of them .	367.08887
when the family business failed , mercer left school and on his mother ' s urging -- for she hoped that he would become an actor -- he joined a local little theater group .	343.21072
when the troupe traveled to new york to participate in a one-act-play competition -- and won -- mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in new york .	411.7633
he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to savannah .	568.5396
but mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up .	1607.7758
`` the place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub ' ' , his mother discovered when she visited him .	712.98737
`` johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor -- he ' s always been a good cook -- and i ' ll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub ' ' .	231.82834
a story , no doubt apocryphal , for mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monacle in those village days .	2256.7126
though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers .	2073.329
one day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle and broke it .	720.4675
the innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle -- and did , over the protests of the former owner -- with a square monacle .	774.796
mercer is supposed to have refused it with , `` anyone who wears a square monacle must be affected ' ' ! !	220.23334
everett miller , then assistant director for the garrick gaieties , a theatre guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written	1060.9949
he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however .	188.385
for him mercer produced the lyric to `` out of breath scared to death of you ' ' , introduced in that most successful of all the gaieties , by sterling holloway .	783.9089
this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke and ira gershwin , by e . y . harburg and duke , and by harry myers .	915.13385
entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song writer to take a wife , elizabeth meehan , a dancer in the gaieties .	1479.5713
the mercers took up residence in brooklyn , and mercer found a regular job in wall street `` misplacing stocks and bonds ' ' .	624.605
when he heard that paul whiteman was looking for singers to replace the rhythm boys , mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , i ' m sure , but because i could write songs and material generally ' ' .	277.48907
while with the whiteman band mercer met jerry arlen .	5617.571
he had yet to meet harold arlen , for although they had `` collaborated ' ' on `` satan ' s li ' l lamb ' ' , mercer and harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them .	636.7767
the lyric , mercer remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody .	495.35944
mercer ' s whiteman association brought him into contact with hoagy carmichael , whose `` snowball ' ' mercer relyriced as `` lazybones ' ' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of mercer ' s song-writing career .	996.7671
after leaving whiteman , mercer joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist .	10697.173
with the help of ziggy elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional jewish melody into a popular song , `` and the angels sing ' ' .	574.98883
the countrywide success of `` lazybones ' ' and `` and the angels sing ' ' could only lead to hollywood , where , besides harold arlen , mercer collaborated with harry warren , jimmy van heusen , richard whiting , walter donaldson , jerome kern , and arthur schwartz .	919.4203
mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs .	492.01407
he may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the u . s . treasury	130.39133
he collaborated on a song with william hartman woodin , who was secretary of the treasury , 1932-33 .	900.1576
when johnny mercer and harold arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , mercer , like arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` hooray for hollywood ' ' , `` ride , tenderfoot , ride ' ' , `` have you got any castles , baby ? ?	531.2675
' ' , and `` too marvelous for words ' ' ( all with richard whiting )	548.7055
with harry warren he did `` the girl friend of the whirling dervish ' ' , `` jeepers creepers ' ' , and `` you must have been a beautiful baby ' ' .	172.93759
mercer ' s lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair .	3125.4983
though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the best of them , mercer ' s forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit .	649.87366
his casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change from harburg ' s , so that arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration .	718.8971
there were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .	1094.711
speaking of his work with johnny mercer , arlen says , `` our working habits were strange .	961.6659
after we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out , we ' d get together for an hour or so every day .	310.53632
while johnny made himself comfortable on the couch , i ' d play the tunes for him .	231.00064
he has a wonderfully retentive memory .	3208.754
after i would finish playing the songs , he ' d just go away without a comment .	286.11176
i wouldn ' t hear from him for a couple of weeks , then he ' d come around with the completed lyric ' ' .	163.7348
arlen is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer mercer has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings in arlen ' s study .	502.858
`` some guys bothered me ' ' , mercer has said .	69.50054
`` i couldn ' t write with them in the same room with me , but i could with harold .	149.4249
he is probably our most original composer	3385.5273
he often uses very odd rhythms , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer ' ' .	303.1679
while arlen and mercer collaborated on hot nocturne , mercer worked also with arthur schwartz on another film , navy blues .	1677.856
arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend ted koehler .	1279.1617
besides doing a single song , `` when the sun comes out ' ' , they worked on the ambitious american-negro suite , for voices and piano , as well as songs for films .	346.58112
the american-negro suite is in a sense an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection of negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage .	208.0546
the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which koehler set the words `` there ' ll be no more work	1101.3134
there ' ll be no more worry ' ' , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot .	323.91864
this grew into the song `` big time comin ' ' ' .	327.7133
by september 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby ' ' .	300.75772
the negro composer hall johnson studied the american-negro suite and said of it , `` of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a negroid idiom in both words and music , these six songs by harold arlen and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest .	1271.8364
thoroughly modern in treatment , they are at the same time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average ' broadway spirituals ' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the ' amen corner ' , ' judgement day , ' gabriel ' s horn , and a frustrated devil -- with a few random hallelujahs thrown in for good measure .	920.13605
i feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole .	3102.764
it had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards .	2942.3428
it was here that the terror-stricken dennis moon played an unrehearsed role during the children ' s party .	2219.4512
a much larger room , adjacent to the lavatory , served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet .	892.22375
that unused room was large enough for -- well , say an elephant could get into it and , as a matter of fact , an elephant did .	367.95038
something occurred on the morning of the children ' s party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us .	614.3455
it so happened that sports writer arthur robinson got out of the hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he be back in an hour or two to continue his convalescence .	830.27185
arthur robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the american .	581.7366
he was ghost writer for babe ruth , whose main talent for literary composition was the signing of his autograph .	930.5145
robbie was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees .	10573.919
he arrived on crutches at the newspaper club with one of his great pals , oliver herford , artist , author , and foe of stupidity .	1137.1427
mr . herford ' s appearance was that of a frustrated gnome .	901.83655
he seemed timid ( at first , ) wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon dangled , and was no bigger than a jockey .	1377.4874
robinson asked herford to escort him to the club ' s lavatory before they sat down for a highball and a game of cards .	550.15405
in the jakes , after robbie and his crutches were properly stowed , mr . herford went to the adjoining facility .	1044.355
he had barely assumed his stance there when a fat fellow charged through the doorway .	1437.3397
without any regard for rest-room protocol , the hulking stranger almost knocked herford off his pins .	11048.723
the artist-author said nothing , but stood to one side .	148.45485
nothing was said , nothing accomplished .	645.50055
the unrelieved stranger eventually turned away from the place of his -- shall we dare say his waterloo ? ?	765.8746
-- to go to the door .	68.68546
mr . herford touched the fat man ' s arm .	175.13388
may i say that you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb -- the younger pliny ' s , if memory serves me -- which , translated freely from the archaic latin , says , ' the more haste , the less peed ' ' ' .	523.4813
governor alfred e . smith was the official host at the children ' s party .	188.49597
united states senator royal s . copeland was wearing the robes of santa claus and a great white beard	1823.1322
the honorable robert wagner , sr . , at that time a justice of the new york supreme court , was on the reception committee .	144.52011
i was in charge of the arrangements -- which were soon enough disarranged .	767.84076
i had had difficulties from the very first day .	106.943306
when , in my enthusiasm , i proposed the party , my city editor ( who disliked the club and many of its members ) tried to block my participation in the gala event .	688.94244
even earlier than that he had resented the fact that i had been chosen to edit the club ' s reporter .	160.5277
city editor victor watson of the new york american was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious shifts of mood .	596.37213
mr . hearst ' s telegraphic code word for victor watson was `` fatboy ' ' .	1719.3077
the staff saw in him the qualities of a don cossack , hence , as mentioned before , his nickname `` the hetman ' ' .	249.41728
the hetman ' s physical aspects were not those of a savage rider of the steppes .	639.2918
indeed , he looked more like a well-fleshed lay brother of the hospice of st . bernard .	2204.0303
he had a purring voice and poker player ' s immobility of features which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried .	653.88196
he was the son of a scottish father and an american jewish mother , long widowed , with whom he lived in a comfortable home in flushing .	579.4543
he had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old , always for the hearst service .	180.67375
from the very first he regarded himself as mr . hearst ' s disciple , defender , and afterward his prime minister , self-ordained .	546.46075
it was said that the hetman plotted to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various coups the destruction of editors who tried to halt his course , the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to mr . hearst .	1092.4032
whatever the hetman ' s ambitions , his colleagues were kept ill at ease .	452.1022
among the outstanding members of the hearst cabinet whom he successfully opposed for a time were the great arthur brisbane , bradford merrill , s . s . carvalho , and colonel van hamm .	722.48175
he also disliked runyon , for no good reason other than the fact that the demon ' s talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the hetman ' s say-so or his supervision .	316.71167
runyon , for his part , had a contemptuous regard for mr . watson .	247.4965
`` he ' s a wrong-o ' ' , said runyon , `` and i wouldn ' t trust him as far as i could throw the statue of liberty ' ' .	188.96529
arthur `` bugs ' ' baer wrote to me just recently , `` vic wanted to die in harness , with his head towards the wagon .	472.0464
he supported his mother and his brother , who afterwards committed suicide .	1175.5892
watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother , blossoms bought with vic ' s allowance to him .	1523.2361
' and would you believe it ' , vic added , ' she likes him better than she does me .	642.7905
about the only time the hetman seemed excited was when one of his own pet ideas was born .	891.24915
then he would get to his feet , as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers , and say almost invariably , `` gentlemen , this is an amazing story ! !	391.6983
it ' s bigger than the armistice ' ' .	87.340454
some of the hetman ' s `` ideas ' ' were dream-ridden , vaguely imparted , and at times preposterous .	735.7306
one day he assigned me to lay bare a `` plot ' ' by the duponts to supply munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur in cuba .	529.5265
he said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip .	394.3851
`` i can tell you this much ' ' , he said .	67.02599
it ' s bigger than the armistice ' ' .	87.340454
i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources .	1679.2574
then i spent the next two days at the baseball park and at jack doyle ' s pool parlors .	559.43976
when i returned to make my report , the hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission .	431.36356
he was busy , he said , in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation .	584.74603
and i was to go to work on that odd matter .	211.43579
i shall tell of it later on .	599.8027
the hetman had a strong liking for a story , any story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods .	584.4968
most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts , and not as a rule by playing clever tricks .	373.44812
one day i tired of following the hetman ' s advice of `` shadowing ' ' and of the `` ring-around-the-rosie ' ' approach to a report that enrico caruso had pinched a lady ' s hip while visiting the central park monkey house .	548.818
i explained my state of mind to artist winsor mccay and to `` bugs ' ' baer .	1063.161
mr . baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the friars .	1975.6837
we fashioned beards , put them on , and reported to the hetman at the city desk .	218.59335
mr . baer had an auburn beard , like longfellow ' s .	4608.1343
mr . mccay had on a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache .	3633.5713
as for myself , i had on an enormous black `` muff ' ' .	341.79507
this , together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses , gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist .	2901.6638
`` we are ready for your next mysterious assignment ' ' , said mr . baer to the hetman .	216.07501
`` where to , sir ' ' ? ?	40.112186
mr . watson did not have much humor in his make-up , but he managed a mirthless smile .	649.361
just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder .	761.476
the hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it .	143.28683
while i was sitting at one of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard , arthur brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand .	1206.0844
he paused for a moment to look at me , then went on to the city desk to deliver his `` today ' ' column .	297.02267
i thought it expedient to take off my derby , my glasses , and the beard	361.5347
i managed to do this by the time the great a . b . returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist .	832.2942
he stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk .	539.5164
then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly out of the room .	1073.2723
he had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression .	11828.84
he had been `` seeing things ' ' .	54.55258
the hetman ' s `` ideas ' ' for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless or lacking in merit .	968.2134
he campaigned successfully for the riddance of `` death avenue ' ' and also brought about the ending of pollution of metropolitan beaches by sewage .	598.2291
he exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , nat ferber and carl helm .	2003.2815
in the conduct of these and many other campaigns , the hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed .	677.16327
it seems to me now , in a long backward glance , that many of the hetman ' s conceits and odd actions -- together with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet in the name of mr . hearst -- were keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day .	425.99356
alone , rejected on every hand , divorced , and in financial trouble , he leaped from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937 .	841.98175
one finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol , w . r . hearst .	634.71045
that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair .	149.88368
the unfinished note , written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope , and addressed to the coroner , makes one wonder about many things `` god forgive me for everything .	810.41583
much to damon runyon ' s amazement , as well as my own , i got along splendidly with the hetman	307.61395
that is , until i became an editor , hence , in his eyes , a rival .	192.58133
not long after colonel van hamm had foisted me on the watson staff i received a salary raise and a contract on the hetman ' s recommendation .	630.0715
during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the hearst service .	210.18431
it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists .	736.7248
i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement .	1476.8513
somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his foe , colonel van hamm , wouldn ' t touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil .	798.818
i remember one day when mr . hearst ( and i never knew why he liked me , either ) sent the hetman a telegram `` please find some more reporters like that young man from denver ' ' .	409.53967
watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm .	231.96014
the colonel grunted , then made a remark which might be construed in either of two ways .	279.29245
`` don ' t bother to look any further .	611.23505
we already have the only one of its kind ' ' .	69.14901
the hetman did have friends , but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession .	701.319
sergeant mike donaldson , congressional medal of honor soldier , was one of them .	663.5612
dr . menas s . gregory was another .	228.25911
i used to go with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment , to sit among the doctor ' s excellent collection of statues , paintings , and books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable .	1090.5731
there was one time , however , when his face clouded and he suddenly blurted , `` why did my brother commit suicide ' ' ? ?	520.041
i cannot remember dr . gregory ' s reply , if , indeed , he made one .	169.90144
if she were not at home , mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there .	306.90134
sometimes , mrs . coolidge would close herself in the green suite on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the white house .	340.52618
mama knew she was playing her son ' s favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not disturb her .	345.4292
all the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic loss , even though the president tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him .	405.64926
a little boy came to give the president his personal condolences , and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in .	305.7997
backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to mrs . coolidge .	300.44308
the president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been before the tragedy .	287.52692
he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips .	1315.9717
dresses were short in the days of mrs . coolidge , and spanish shawls were thrown over them .	371.66895
he got her dozens of them .	86.38377
one shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she draped it over the banister on the second floor , and it hung over the stairway .	497.12915
the president used to look at it with a ghost of a smile .	267.8341
mrs . coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection .	880.071
she kept the dolls on the lincoln bed .	226.30109
at night , when mama would turn back the covers , she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night .	300.42316
mama always felt that the collection symbolized mrs . coolidge ' s wish for a little girl .	257.7973
among the dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady , who would pick it up and look at it often .	401.95102
it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist .	1754.6682
an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for mrs . coolidge ' s first granddaughter .	417.03485
mama knew this doll was meant to help mrs . coolidge overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future .	661.63043
the name inside the envelope was `` cynthia ' ' .	567.9221
the coolidges ' life , after the death of their son , was quieter than ever .	256.50232
john was away at school most of the time .	81.297295
mrs . coolidge would knit , and the president would sit reading , or playing with the many pets around them .	822.52313
now and then , the president would call for `` little jack , master of the hounds ' ' , which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the white house since teddy roosevelt ' s administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals .	226.77402
it was part of little jack ' s work to look after the dogs .	269.02676
one white house dog was immortalized in a painting .	826.78534
that was rob roy , who posed with mrs . coolidge for the portrait by howard chandler christy .	698.2648
to get him to pose , mrs . coolidge would feed him candy , so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did .	402.39575
i would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress mrs . coolidge is wearing in this painting .	588.3184
it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian .	1024.6287
people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on .	595.49915
the dress in the painting is a bright red , with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side .	956.60767
there is a long train flowing from the shoulders .	706.3788
mrs . coolidge gave mama this dress for me , and i wore it many times .	409.92496
i still have the dress , and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution as a memento , or , as i more fondly hope , to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the presidents -- if i can get it organized .	520.4173
but to get back to the coolidge household , mrs . coolidge so obviously loved dogs , that the public sent her more dogs -- calamity jane , timmy , and blackberry .	1207.7152
the last two were a red and a black chow .	1228.3595
rob roy remained boss of all the dogs .	68.47202
he showed them what to do , and taught them how to keep the maids around the white house in a state of terror .	319.76358
the dogs would run through the halls after him like a burst of bullets , and all the maids would run for cover .	535.56604
mama didn ' t know what to do -- whether to tell on rob roy or not -- since she had the ear of mrs . coolidge more than the other maids .	457.83252
but she was afraid the first lady would not understand , because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first family .	507.89423
every day , when the president took his nap , rob roy would stretch out on the window seat near him , like a perfect gentleman , and stare thoughtfully out the window , or he would take a little nap himself .	781.56757
he would not make a sound until the president had wakened and left for the office	593.7979
then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear .	422.03564
his signal was for the other dogs to come running , but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch out .	221.99484
rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to his office every morning .	590.9123
rob roy was well aware of the importance of this mission , and he would walk in front of the president , looking neither to the right nor to the left .	117.82301
at dinner , lunch , or breakfast , the president would call out , `` supper ' ' ! !	131.7434
-- he called all meals supper -- after the butler had announced the meal .	1122.2039
all the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to the dining room .	369.53177
they would all lie around on the rug during the meal , a very pretty sight as rob roy , prudence , and calamity jane were all snow-white .	1449.9343
when prudence and blackberry were too young to be trusted in the dining room , they were tied to the radiator with their leashes , and they would cry .	404.62518
mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first family returned .	807.96216
finally , mama did mention to mrs . coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs , and then mrs . coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone , even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity .	306.98532
mama was now the first maid to mrs . coolidge , because catherine , the previous first maid , had become ill and died .	663.52795
mrs . coolidge chose mama in her place .	352.79803
it was a high mark for mama .	1064.8352
every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship .	694.318
for the coolidges , it was mr . and mrs . frank w . stearns of boston , massachusetts , owners of a large department store .	180.24161
they seemed to be at the white house half the time .	213.69559
the butlers were amused because when the stearns were there , the president would say grace at breakfast .	465.33734
if the stearns were not there , grace would be omitted .	615.9198
speaking of breakfast , the president inaugurated a new custom -- that of conducting business at the breakfast table .	690.49084
the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part .	245.30923
a new bill had been passed under harding that designated the government , rather than the president , as the tab-lifter for official meals .	743.4783
so the president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government officials to attend .	1550.1028
he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate .	686.796
mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful , mr . coolidge certainly made a good president .	658.3671
he knew exactly how to be colorful ! !	97.94774
the favorite guest of the house , as far as the staff was concerned , was mr . wrigley , the chewing gum king .	287.26694
the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more , and every christmas , mr . wrigley sent the president a check for $100 , to be divided among all the help .	587.39
you can imagine that he got pretty good service .	386.79312
another good friend of the coolidges ' was george b . harvey , who was the ambassador to great britain from 1921 to 1923 .	537.3236
he had been a friend of the hardings , and continued to be invited by the coolidges .	414.7062
the first royalty whom mama ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania , who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 , 1926 .	648.84076
she was not an overnight guest in the white house , but mr . ike hoover , the chief usher , had mama check her fur coat when she came in , and take care of her needs .	532.56616
mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen .	496.62686
mama was very patriotic , and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the white house .	486.0297
actually , two flags were used at the mansion -- a small one on rainy days , and a big one on bright days .	412.83044
the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind , and mama would mend it .	929.18616
she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening .	286.259
she used to tell me , `` when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way , i have the wonderful , safe feeling that americans are protected no matter which way the wind blows ' ' .	479.2476
even when mrs . coolidge was in mourning for her son , she reached out to help other people in trouble .	305.0596
one person she helped was my brother .	546.25885
mama had told her how emmett ' s lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war .	406.37314
he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number of times .	1474.4314
taking a personal interest , she had the doctor assigned to the white house , dr . james coupal , look emmett over .	330.38864
as a result , he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service .	275.71378
but again , there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy washington weather , and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work .	326.75708
when mrs . coolidge was in mourning , she did not wear black .	482.40518
she wore grey every day , and white every evening .	288.82834
mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors .	1262.4674
the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started .	1023.0942
she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face .	497.2228
on the social side , the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the white house thrilled her the most .	1528.3638
it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs , and , just as the first lady stepped off the last tread , mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the blue room to greet her guests with the president .	497.71576
mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night .	349.10373
one night , mama came home practically in a state of shock .	579.4697
she had stood at the bottom of the stairs , as usual , when mrs . coolidge came down , in the same dress that is now in the smithsonian , to greet her guests .	257.25073
mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ! !	210.42206
she reached and reached around the dress , but there was nothing there .	133.88838
she looked up and saw that , without knowing it , mrs . coolidge was holding it aloft .	698.54846
mrs . coolidge looked down , saw mama ' s horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor .	945.8316
mama swirled the train in place , and not a step was lost .	132.14435
the coolidges did not always live at the white house during the presidency .	180.71054
impressive as this enumeration is , it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of jews , collectively or individually , that have been attested by their gentile environment .	1092.0839
it is reasonable to affirm two propositions jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things to all men	2892.7134
some jews have in fact been all things to all men .	309.55624
in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody ' s ally	665.96295
in the market place jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers , or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors .	4695.926
and so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph .	252.06125
diversity of perception , yes	8871.093
but the two do not invariably or even typically coincide .	10006.45
the `` conventional ' ' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research .	278.89078
conventional images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant images can be both true and false .	493.7744
the genuinely interesting question , then , becomes what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of jews ? ?	846.6724
the working test of `` the facts ' ' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations .	1141.7843
granted , such `` functional ' ' images are subject to human error	379.26434
they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error .	705.85016
in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished current intelligence	2913.9377
general grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book	547.4633
if so , he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future .	357.06393
but general grant may have been self-victimized .	975.6053
he may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs .	676.79333
predispositions , in turn , fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis .	1324.0233
to some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments .	1762.518
in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality .	1007.7965
the anti-semitism of hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of lueger ' s politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna .	992.2634
but millions of human beings were exposed to lueger ' s propaganda and record .	639.09094
after allowing for group exposures , it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism .	432.03113
they include harmonies and conflicts within the whole man , and mechanisms whereby inner components are more or less smoothly met .	1207.1027
modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind .	425.83575
the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it .	818.8614
undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality .	1095.9807
many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal .	887.40454
undoubtedly , however , the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest .	280.70096
speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy .	289.13245
since we can neither undo nor redo the past , we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow .	789.4648
in this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local , national , and world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having some effect , large or small , upon gentile-jewish relations .	943.76874
what shall these effects be ? ?	107.09222
i am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in gentile-jewish relations .	1065.2496
comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method .	1177.2766
the tasks are briefly indicated by these questions what are my goals in gentile-jewish relations ? ?	919.355
what are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized ? ?	336.71497
what factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places ? ?	456.7586
what is the probable course of future developments ? ?	205.94057
what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values ? ?	516.6546
it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range .	844.30914
the discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy .	322.651
as a groundwork for the proposal i give some attention to the first task enumerated above , the clarification of goal .	536.7311
my reply is that i associate myself with all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity .	817.7626
the basic goal finds partial expression in the universal declaration of human rights , a statement initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many religious and philosophical traditions .	682.4496
within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved , as well as upon the nature of the claim , the characteristics of the claimant , the justifications proposed , and the predispositions of the community decision makers who are called upon to act .	334.19373
if jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal , it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship .	349.38635
when decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion .	485.7174
since the recognition of israel as a nation state , claims are made in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body politic .	560.56305
community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states .	1094.1448
in free countries many controversies involve self-styled jews who use the symbol in asserting a vaguely `` cultural ' ' rather than religious or political identity .	2157.3035
the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups .	968.2919
we know that much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the key symbol of the jew .	324.03616
many public and private controversies will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in the mind and usage of gentile and jew .	635.1279
however , in the context of legal and civic policy , these controversies are less than novel .	848.83234
they involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-jewish groups .	908.0832
so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned , categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships	1393.1168
claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties .	566.6915
it is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews and gentiles during coming years .	788.4645
social process is always anchored in past predisposition	7810.4487
but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost .	6004.3657
in conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net advantage , taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration .	1612.4521
it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate	1213.0157
for instance , imagine the situation if israel ever joins an enemy coalition .	3065.5251
the formal position of americans who identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the jewish symbol is already clear	499.8942
the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed .	1209.7999
when we consider the disorganized state of the world community , and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as jews , it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill .	493.51785
during moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming .	460.90814
but their freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which they and the people around them enter the crisis .	371.71967
at such critical moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously `` pay off ' ' .	848.36334
by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact , with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified .	2295.7708
among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control .	1404.1764
we are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society	304.433
a truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best .	237.52492
during intercrisis periods the educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every age and condition .	651.4246
as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected .	732.6676
now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach	485.60138
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good .	732.194
in any case i do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions .	782.34314
i assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small , and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others .	514.62244
properly used , the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment .	901.73206
let us not confuse the issue by labeling the objective or the method `` psychoanalytic ' ' , for this is a well established term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated by sigmund freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered personalities .	593.49835
the traditional method proceeds by the technique of free association , punctuated by interpretations proposed by the psychoanalytic interviewer .	1462.5897
what we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods by which they are sought .	347.22076
for what we propose , however , a psychoanalyst is not necessary , even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses -- his defenses of himself to himself .	372.6388
for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary	977.0247
but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind .	196.81293
the relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said , whether he responds with anger or applause .	899.4295
but simple involvement is not enough	987.72736
self-discovery calls for an open , permissive , inquiring posture of self-observation .	3649.0247
the symposium provides an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were addressing definite audiences -- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification .	1323.0034
an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself , resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the jew .	963.2874
two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time .	290.33218
one , a reservation on the point i have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking , pseudo-feeling , and pseudo-willing , which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom .	624.52405
in essence this involves grounding one ' s thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one ' s own values and experience .	218.12553
there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else .	411.0914
clearly what the person brings to the reading is important .	284.23862
moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking	540.6751
if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity .	214.48756
the second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today .	310.72308
in the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation .	938.19415
the reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different ' ' ? ?	129.98967
and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .	424.4194
the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .	336.86978
and this , i think , holds for values as well as life styles .	649.348
one would need to test this proposition carefully	4719.6675
after all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) reader ' s digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character i ever met ' ' deals with village grocers , country doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and so forth .	2328.1885
scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too .	702.87103
but still , the proposition is worth examination .	3711.175
it is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right ' ' and `` wrong ' ' .	120.71768
i do not know that this is true	237.39528
both flugel and ranyard west deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber .	892.54504
it forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy .	244.48724
i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience -- most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of course , to the influence of religion .	275.22607
still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one ' s ideas of right and wrong	232.51562
certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence .	1376.6863
probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .	361.82358
this is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it .	516.2172
in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .	394.61365
literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance .	220.26411
this , no doubt , is part of what gilbert seldes implies when he says of the arts , `` they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense ' ' .	512.75916
men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .	411.9104
feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .	363.11362
a need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so to speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature .	335.9644
the terms `` renewal ' ' and `` refreshed ' ' , which often come up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal ' ' of purpose and a `` refreshed ' ' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction .	319.54776
the notion of `` inspiration ' ' is somehow cognate to this feeling .	441.70425
how literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message ' ' , as well as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose .	215.52664
one of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion .	634.24603
let us differentiate a few of these ideas .	186.92476
the aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one .	1059.5504
the idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , plato ' s notion of the arousal of emotion .	480.33362
a third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts , giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals .	1153.1019
this is given some expression in beardsley ' s notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision .	355.61475
a fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in housman ' s fine phrase on the arts they `` transform and beautify our inner nature ' ' .	497.0673
it is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .	621.78674
f . s . c . northrop , in his discussion of the `` functions and future of poetry ' ' , suggests this `` one of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects .	592.19916
if art is to release us from these postulated things ( things we must think symbolically about ) and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these common sense entities ' ' .	909.748
i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it .	922.7029
richards ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses .	506.21793
a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these .	120.76237
but there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention .	289.67105
in the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate .	701.74146
the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way .	698.1046
william wimsatt and cleanth brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected `` for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) -- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at all .	623.66486
something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like `` expressions ' ' of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement ' ' .	1362.4562
the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience .	563.35474
here i do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion .	298.25446
i mean something more like freud ' s concept of the utility of `` play ' ' to a small child he plays `` house ' ' or `` doctor ' ' or `` fireman ' ' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control .	517.34436
there is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time .	224.6502
in b . m . spinley ' s portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .	894.06226
perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation .	483.56314
anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean .	439.65125
it is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .	566.2966
in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with respect to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature ' ' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required .	242.26465
in the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden , or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of words ? ?	326.35657
these are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing .	993.03064
one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide .	257.02243
sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill .	640.239
among other things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences .	1000.5739
both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged .	372.52985
its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre .	425.45053
the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment contrast the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty .	1289.102
along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have seen .	443.01035
in a symposium and general exploration of the field of personal perception and interpersonal behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception	443.37997
solomon asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events .	1048.2041
but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .	748.4228
i would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what i shall call depth .	229.80026
i use this term to mean three things a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .	570.3975
it is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia .	6046.4565
i think these attributes cluster , but i have no evidence .	155.55145
in fact , i can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .	400.70963
the late r . g . collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote ``	420.32852
we are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with chaucer and cimabue , or even shakespeare and titian .	1082.1069
by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and japanese colour-prints	1660.409
but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place .	266.0507
the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else ' ' .	410.06277
one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper critic , and of the creative artist himself .	379.94925
there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .	608.37994
such study may take many forms .	410.50885
the study of ideas in literature is one of these .	103.75261
of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene .	1649.5126
he will frequently return to it .	59.95933
the continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other .	1459.7311
when we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption .	230.29807
most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them .	289.1934
many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .	728.3347
this understanding , of course , may in its turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical .	598.4328
but the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture ' ' , or technique .	1689.9135
it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight .	952.2935
but , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other .	262.6596
at this point a working definition of idea is in order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed .	747.6802
the term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience .	1999.533
it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .	3330.4976
an idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned .	755.7166
in this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so to speak `` writ large ' ' in history of literature where they recur continually .	430.59167
outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries	375.53653
also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man .	215.49048
one might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in so far as it includes the literatures , must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning .	719.24615
we need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature .	269.59708
an idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .	915.31146
thus burns ' s `` my love is like a red , red rose ' ' and hopkins ' `` the thunder-purple sea-beach , plumed purple of thunder ' ' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .	913.522
on the other hand , arnold ' s `` the unplumbed , salt , estranging sea ' ' , taken in its context , certainly does so .	418.26758
understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies .	746.74524
thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period .	2510.4004
again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways .	743.94604
our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .	2586.9438
very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs to ' ' some way of thought labelled as a `` school ' ' or an `` -ism ' ' , i . e . a complex or `` syndrome ' ' of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .	323.71945
thus ideas like `` grace ' ' , `` salvation ' ' , and `` providence ' ' cluster together in traditional christianity .	124.28466
usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` -ism ' ' or mode of thought .	537.81506
accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley ' s poems or the type of stoicism present in henley ' s `` invictus ' ' , and we may find that describing such platonism or such stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise .	507.62744
after all , shelley is no `` orthodox ' ' or hellenic platonist , and even his `` romantic ' ' platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries .	427.29822
again , henley ' s attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like marcus aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost christian , comparable to the patience expressed in milton ' s sonnet on his own blindness .	2110.5566
in recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences .	296.83142
when these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even , to some extent , with science .	632.07825
here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian ' s research .	195.36507
let us quote once more from r . g . collingwood `` history is properly concerned with the actions of human beings regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world	441.4741
regarded from the inside , it is the carrying into action of a certain thought the historian ' s business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them .	301.10828
it is a characteristic of thoughts that in re-thinking them we come , ipso facto , to understand why they were thought ' ' .	593.3697
such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition .	287.51483
`` history has this in common with every other science that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .	330.52432
this is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential .	1105.7977
the knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events ' ' .	177.17786
it is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research .	687.5536
the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at the same time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another .	380.32666
let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought -- turning our attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades .	726.86505
we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .	661.62634
finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .	643.5222
no one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them .	706.63885
still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .	508.02283
the actual moments of contact are vitally important .	968.72
these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned .	344.9153
perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world has been that of the old and new testament .	378.15915
certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the bible .	340.7102
this reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence .	1226.7468
a contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , st . augustine , john bunyan , and thomas jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression .	710.84534
in much the same way , we recognize the importance of shakespeare ' s familarity with plutarch and montaigne , of shelley ' s study of plato ' s dialogues , and of coleridge ' s enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from plato to schelling and william godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of english men of letters .	592.7218
we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .	567.00024
english philosopher samuel alexander ' s debt to wordsworth and meredith is a recent interesting example , as also a . n . whitehead ' s understanding of the english romantics , chiefly shelley and wordsworth .	375.15335
hegel ' s profound admiration for the insights of the greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy .	972.15625
again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius , who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles .	1735.647
here an important caveat is in order .	101.07896
we must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units ' ' in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for that matter , from one individual to another .	402.24036
`` suppose you take mr . hearst ' s morning american at $10 , 000 a year ' ' , brisbane proposed .	152.49126
`` you could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors .	547.8114
if within one year you can make a success out of the american , you can practically name your own salary thereafter .	515.2849
of course , if you don ' t make the american a success , hearst will have no further use for you ' ' .	82.883354
the blue-eyed watson decided that he would dislike living in new york , and the deal fell through .	378.15393
hearst ' s luck was even poorer when he had a chat with franklin k . lane , a prominent california journalist and reform politician , whom he asked for his support .	694.53357
lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of california in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of hearst ' s san francisco examiner .	658.5129
hearst disclaimed blame for this , but the conversation , according to lane , ended on a tart note .	202.75403
`` mr . lane ' ' , hearst said , `` if you ever wish anything that i can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done ' ' .	98.07411
`` mr . hearst ' ' , lane replied as he left , `` if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put the telegram down as a forgery ' ' .	299.59903
hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to new york to become a father .	895.6176
on april 10 , 1904 , his first child was born , a son named george after the late senator .	599.5347
hearst saw his wife and child , sent a joyful message to his mother in california , and soon returned to washington , where on april 22 , for the first time , he opened his mouth in congress .	272.39862
this was not before the house but before the judiciary committee , where he asked for action on one of his pet bills , that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly .	461.45126
attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united states attorney for the southern district of new york .	268.70743
hearst had spent more than $60 , 000 of his own money in the probe , but still attorney general knox was quiescent .	625.3897
six of the railroads carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields , hearst said , not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines .	2751.9575
they had watered their stock at immense profit , then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton , netting themselves another $20 , 000 , 000 in annual profit .	963.2874
`` the attorney general has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months ' ' , hearst said .	635.40753
`` he has not acted in any way , and won ' t let anyone take it away from him .	358.20142
what i want is to have this evidence come before congress and if the attorney general does not report it , as i am very sure he won ' t , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , i then wish that a committee of seven representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence .	251.0187
the congressman tried hard , but failed .	163.60641
this was the very sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind .	393.51593
there can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington , overt or implied , to block anything hearst wanted , even if it was something good .	333.0717
hatred tied his hands in congress .	52.191174
roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley .	1561.5431
they were repelled by his noisy newspapers , his personal publicity , his presumptuous campaign for the presidential nomination , and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses .	1359.2183
he might get votes from his constituents , but he would never get a helping hand in congress .	205.35045
even the regular democrats disowned him .	9135.563
inherently incapable of cooperating with others , he ran his own show regardless of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on .	1911.2474
he was a political maverick , a reformer with his own program , determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him .	1775.052
he showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats .	772.9871
he sought to run congress as he ran his new york american or journal , a scheme veteran legislators resisted .	1278.6318
for a freshman congressman to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends .	888.9097
he soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the house , and came to be regarded with detestation by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline .	1576.4313
to old-line democrats , the hearst presidential boom , now in full cry , was the joke of the new century .	329.39777
yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t . r . a semblance of a race .	255.80792
there was talk of dragging old ex-president cleveland out of retirement for another try .	4845.485
some preferred judge alton b . parker of new york .	131.15414
there was a host of dark horses .	669.5502
the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country .	236.32219
platoons of hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention , and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading .	414.72458
just when it was needed for the campaign , hearst paper no . 8 , the boston american , began publication .	391.2266
a bay state supporter said , `` mr . hearst ' s fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in boston ' ' .	103.953766
his candidacy affected his journalism somewhat .	9353.653
he ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain from using such words as `` seduction ' ' , `` rape ' ' , `` abortion ' ' , `` criminal assault ' ' and `` born out of wedlock ' ' .	378.34564
in a story headed , `` hearst offers cash ' ' , the republican new york tribune spread the money rumor , quoting an unnamed `` hearst supporter ' ' as saying	944.36835
`` the argument that is cutting most ice is that hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt them if he were elected .	649.71356
the hearst men say that if hearst is nominated , he and his immediate friends will contribute to the democratic national committee the sum of $1 , 500 , 000 .	318.40912
this , it is urged , would relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the trust magnates .	918.21716
the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a democratic victory absolutely fruitless .	765.1285
the average democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office .	356.5797
it has been a long time since he has seen any campaign money , and when the proposition is laid down to him as the friends of mr . hearst are laying it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard the hearst bandwagon ' ' .	352.3134
if anything , the conservative democrats were more opposed to hearst than the republicans .	730.2798
in his own state of new york , the two democratic bellwethers , state leader hill and tammany boss murphy , were saying nothing openly against hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites , murphy being for cleveland and hill for parker .	1814.8392
they had lost twice with the radical bryan , and were having no part of hearst , whom they considered more radical than bryan .	635.0129
but his increasing strength in the west looked menacing .	597.7569
it caused henry watterson to sound a blast in his louisville courier-journal	2545.3242
`` does any sane democrat believe that mr . hearst , a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues , without a word or act in the public life of his country , past or present , that can be shown to be his to commend him , could by any possibility be elected president of the united states ? ?	234.0121
but there is a hearst barrel .	2522.5823
more splenetic was senator edward carmack of tennessee , a parker man .	778.56287
`` the nomination of hearst would compass the ruin of the party ' ' , carmack said .	391.4789
`` it would be a disgrace , and , as i have already said to the people of tennessee , if hearst is nominated , we may as well pen a dispatch , and send it back from the field of battle ' all is lost , including our honor ' ' ' .	352.11636
a lone pro-hearst voice from new york city was that of william devery , who had been expelled as a tammany leader but still claimed strong influence in his own district .	701.4701
`` i understand [ hearst ] is a candidate for presidential honors ' ' , devery said without cracking a smile .	3158.483
`` there ' s nothing like buildin ' from the bottom up .	6348.1367
if he ' s going to the st . louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it .	179.04826
he ' s got a lot of friends , and he ought to come along and let us know if he wants our help ' ' .	166.07494
hearst won the iowa state convention , but ran into a bitter battle in indiana before losing to parker , drawing an angry statement from indiana ' s john w . kern	790.89966
`` we are menaced for the first time in the history of the republic by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase the presidential nomination .	390.19894
our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers .	2747.5037
as for the paid hessians from other states , we are here to instruct the indiana democracy in their duty , i have nothing but contempt .	496.171
the hearst dollar mark is all over them .	237.28108
the talk of a hearst `` barrel ' ' was increasing .	213.09279
another indiana observer later commented , `` perhaps we shall never know how much was spent ( by hearst ) , but if as much money was expended elsewhere as in indiana a liberal fortune was squandered ' ' .	394.03152
in his fight for the illinois and indiana delegations , hearst made several trips to chicago to confer with andrew lawrence , the former san francisco examiner man who was now his chicago kingpin , and once to meet with bryan .	1642.5161
on one visit he stopped at the office of the american , where he was known surreptitiously as `` the great white chief ' ' , and for the first time met his managing editor , fat moses koenigsberg .	376.28683
koenigsberg never did learn what hearst wanted , for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door .	591.0978
`` never mind , thank you ' ' , he said .	45.735565
`` i must hurry to catch my train ' ' .	96.30296
another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle of letters that had accumulated for him , saying , `` but mr . hearst , what shall i do with this correspondence ' ' ? ?	124.56821
`` i ' ll show you ' ' , hearst replied , grinning .	313.75516
he took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket .	821.9052
every letter answers itself in a couple of weeks ' ' .	55.426777
hearst hopped into a private railroad car with max ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states , always wearing a frock coat , listening intently to local politicians , and generally making a good impression .	1403.0989
he laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated .	286.76547
`` i should , of course ' ' , he said , `` like any other man , be honored and gratified should the democrats see fit to nominate me .	275.56934
but i do not have to be bribed by office to be a democrat .	230.63457
i have supported the democratic party in the last five campaigns .	2716.1948
i supported cleveland three times and bryan twice .	728.2913
i intend to support the nominee of the party at st . louis , whoever he may be ' ' .	86.73915
the hearst press followed the chief ' s progress at the various state conventions with its usual admiring attention , stressing the `` enthusiasm ' ' and `` loyalty ' ' he inspired .	349.0713
this was historic in its way , for it marked the first time an american presidential aspirant had advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land .	1248.2865
yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value .	402.94296
when nan patterson , a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who had appeared in a floradora road show , rode down broadway in a hansom cab with her married lover , frank young , she stopped the cab to disclose that young had been shot dead , tearfully insisting that he had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so .	1464.3755
trevelyan ' s liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit , a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty .	341.46567
his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of garibaldi ' s exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the events described .	655.6463
the three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of trevelyan ' s prose which remained conspicuous through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority .	557.8914
the confused rambling of guerrilla warfare , such as most of garibaldi ' s campaigns were , was brought to life by trevelyan ' s pen in some of the best passages in the books .	221.11493
his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities .	872.8713
military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients .	292.90344
but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story .	341.51163
trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject .	252.21008
the outstanding example was in garibaldi and the thousand , where he made use of unpublished papers of lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the straits of messina .	949.17725
in looking back over the volumes , it is possible to find errors of interpretation , some of which were not so evident at the time of writing .	138.31754
thus trevelyan repeats the story which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto at the insistence of general radetzky .	4696.974
later research has shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false .	434.27087
trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and french policy , and he is more than generous in assessing british policy .	520.1253
but fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of italy , a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication .	488.47787
trevelyan ' s manin and the venetian revolution of 1848 , his last major volume on an italian theme , was written in a minor key .	520.1124
published in 1923 , it did not gain the popular acclaim of the garibaldi volumes , probably because trevelyan felt less at home with manin , the bourgeois lawyer , than with garibaldi , the filibuster .	781.18604
the complexities of venetian politics eluded him , but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures , with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of the part played by its leading figure .	1228.6324
if it is not one of his best books , it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his own garibaldi .	283.59137
already trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english figures of the same period .	765.03326
first the life of john bright appeared and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill .	1121.0883
of the two , the life of bright is incomparably the better biography .	696.76465
trevelyan centers too exclusively on bright , is insufficiently appreciative of the views of bright ' s opponents and critics , and makes light of the genuine difficulties faced by peel .	965.04865
yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man , his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength .	516.6711
in the story of bright and the corn law agitation , the crimean war , the american civil war , and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long .	834.3692
because bright ' s speeches were so much a part of him , there are long and numerous quotations , which , far from making the biography diffuse , help to give us the feel of the man .	358.90408
associated in a sense with the manchester school through his mother ' s family , trevelyan conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive .	434.69144
nineteenth-century virtues , however , seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular .	422.63434
the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all .	960.85736
it is a whig history of the `` tory reaction ' ' which preceded the reform bill of 1832 , and it uses the figure of grey to give some unity to the narrative .	333.46243
the volume is a piece of passionate special pleading , written with the heat -- and often with the wisdom , it must be said -- of a liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832 .	841.034
characteristically , trevelyan enjoyed writing the work .	193.1365
the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of discontent and repression was , he has told us , congenial to his artistic sense .	537.9884
and grey ' s northumberland background was close to trevelyan ' s own .	686.6028
but his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation .	900.5251
some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the tory tradition appear `` contemptible rather than intelligible ' ' , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the `` intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which , at times , politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents ' ' .	468.91122
the liberal-radical heritage which informs all of trevelyan ' s interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues and oversimplified the period .	592.2754
for once his touch deserted him .	2932.0752
research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to a more ambitious work .	756.81836
britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook designed `` to give the sense of continuous growth , to show how economic led to social , and social to political change , how the political events reacted on the economic and social , and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process ' ' .	346.73914
the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832 .	401.54028
more temperately than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias , trevelyan vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days , portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors , and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus .	1268.7897
by what one reader called a `` series of dissolving views ' ' , he merges one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth .	433.02567
but after 1832 , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics , often unconnected by any single thread .	1301.5564
economic analysis was never trevelyan ' s strong point and the england of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis .	558.0641
yet after 1832 , the interrelations of economic and social and political affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional political account .	1007.18066
finally , the period after 1870 receives little attention and that quite superficial .	3509.4436
yet britain in the nineteenth century became the vade mecum of beginning students of history , went through edition after edition , and continues to be reprinted up to the very present .	635.4384
its success is a tribute , above all , to trevelyan ' s brilliance as a literary stylist .	503.31665
in 1924 trevelyan traveled to the united states , where he delivered the lowell lectures at harvard university .	283.08405
these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of english development which took form afterward as a history of england .	370.04718
in short order , the general history became his most popular work and has remained , aside from his later social history , the work most widely favored by the public .	528.68805
the history of england has often been compared with green ' s short history .	273.47583
like green , trevelyan aimed to write a history not of `` english kings or english conquests ' ' , but of the english people .	426.85406
the history takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than english schoolboys , and like britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes beyond 1870 .	744.9279
trevelyan ' s excursions into contemporary history were rarely happy ones .	1084.9341
but as a stimulating , provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable .	503.09253
living pictures of the early boroughs , country life in tudor and stuart times , the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature , the common law , parliamentary development .	2055.3127
the strength of the history is also its weakness .	492.47037
trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and character over those of other peoples .	320.61002
his nationalism was not a new characteristic , but its self-consciousness , even its self-satisfaction , is more obvious in a book that stretches over the long reach of english history .	519.0255
and yet the elements which capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the english story worth telling and worth remembering .	1725.9438
tolerance and compromise , social justice and civil liberty , are today too often in short supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan ' s emphasis on their central place in the english tradition .	770.43445
like most major works of synthesis , the history of england is informed by the positive views of a first-class mind , and this is surely a major work .	309.89462
four years after the publication of the history of england , the first volume of trevelyan ' s queen anne trilogy appeared .	257.30127
by now he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge and had been honored by the award of the order of merit .	466.8235
his academic duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen .	2787.6675
blenheim was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession , the three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne .	731.3283
like his volume on wycliffe , the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents , in this case illustrative of the history of queen anne ' s reign down to 1707 .	405.8259
trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where macaulay ' s history of england had broken off .	738.214
in addition , he believed in the `` dramatic unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 , lying between the stuart and hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own ' ' .	525.8804
he saw the age as one in which britain `` settled her free constitution ' ' and attained her modern place in the world .	343.62814
to most observers , there is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon the years of anne ' s reign which in reality existed only in the pages of his history .	395.65765
of the three volumes , blenheim is easily the best .	772.7855
in four opening chapters reminiscent of macaulay ' s famous third chapter , trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening of the eighteenth century .	450.7631
his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life .	1178.5708
he tends to underestimate -- or perhaps to view charitably -- the brutality and the violence of the age , so that there is an idyllic quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality .	526.3952
yet as an evocation of time past , there are few such successful portraits in english historical literature .	538.55695
once the scene is set , trevelyan skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim .	1894.1464
the account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of garibaldi ' s campaigns , trevelyan ' s outstanding military narrative .	307.32263
the scene is etched in sharp detail , the military problems brilliantly explained , and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident .	340.23776
if only for this modest masterpiece of military history , blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars .	1516.6674
ramillies and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity .	1012.7295
yet in several chapters on scotland in the eighteenth century , trevelyan copes persuasively with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background of scottish religion , customs , and traditions .	662.9536
i stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces .	2773.0166
questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities .	911.4539
after making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the rhine into germany .	268.57883
`` may we come with you ' ' ? ?	13.205538
called out a dozen young voices .	700.7507
`` well , i might not get that far ' ' , i told them , `` as actually i have no papers to enter germany and , as a matter of fact , no permit to return to france once i leave ' ' .	131.70288
we would all meet at ten o ' clock at the kehl bridge , five miles from strasbourg , and march triumphantly across into germany .	365.58728
there was only one hitch the small town of kehl , on the other side of the rhine , was still under french jurisdiction .	345.59296
the real franco-german frontier was beyond the town ' s limits .	109.98386
in fact , all persons were permitted to cross the rhine into kehl , there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river .	525.3781
that evening , as i learned later , the students , enjoying that spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students , surged out onto the streets of strasbourg , overturning empty streetcars , marking up store fronts , and shouting imprudently , `` garry davis to power ' ' ! !	1433.2648
as i got off the trolley at kehl bridge the next morning , i was met by what looked like 5 , 000 students , some of whom were carrying sticks apparently for the coming `` battle ' ' with the police .	453.14984
alarmed by this display of weapons , i looked toward the bridge and there saw , stretched across the near side , a cordon of policemen , their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several french officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby .	1020.23157
`` listen please ' ' , i called to the students in french .	85.75965
`` i thank you most heartily for being here .	1904.8832
this is full evidence of your support for my principles .	254.24857
these principles , however , will not be served by violence in any form .	100.38488
if they are right , they will prevail of and by themselves .	175.24089
i ask you all to support me in this .	147.37094
if one finger is raised against the authorities , all our moral power will vanish .	638.5938
your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what i am saying .	241.69846
i have full confidence in you .	101.51043
i marched up to the waiting officials , the students massed behind me .	1171.4025
as usual , the press photographers were on hand .	2678.118
the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade , and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france .	1020.1965
i replied in the affirmative , taking out my recently acquired titre d ' identite et de voyage , on which was stamped a permission to leave france .	848.7724
he examined it carefully , handed it back and said , `` eh bien , you may leave france ' ' .	366.79526
one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way , demanding to know whether i had permission to enter germany .	766.7285
`` no , i have no permission to enter germany ' ' , i told him .	131.59283
`` alors , you may go no farther ' ' , he said imperiously .	188.50047
`` is this then the frontier ' ' ? ?	31.954918
at this , the students let out a yell , knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of kehl .	819.2809
`` but i have no permission to re-enter france , and i have just left ' ' , i told him .	151.20438
`` i must then be standing on the line between france and germany ' ' .	102.22349
but there is no line between france and germany , that is , no actual line .	212.1932
`` but if there is no line , how can there be two countries ? ?	469.72495
you have just given me permission to leave france , which i did .	267.5228
and as you know , i have no permission to re-enter france once out .	375.16013
now i learn i cannot enter germany .	219.35214
obviously i ' m stuck on the line between the two countries ' ' .	166.39304
the students were laughing uproariously at this piece of logic , and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile .	1273.6469
`` mais non ' ' , the interior ministry man coaxed , `` you may come back to strasbourg , now , if you wish ' ' .	113.994125
then will you give me a visa to re-enter france ' ' ? ?	215.19762
but there is no question of a visa .	241.87268
you are still in france ' ' .	30.653114
`` ah , then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here ' ' -- i indicated the french occupation officer -- `` informs me that germany is just on the other side of him ' ' .	396.17078
the interior man looked uneasily at his french compatriot .	14351.264
from the crowd were coming cries of `` he ' s right ' ' ! !	138.48155
`` there must be a line ' ' ! !	25.978392
and `` bravo , garry , continue ' ' ! !	82.89387
seeing their hesitation , i said , `` well , until i have permission to enter germany , or a visa to re-enter france , i shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries ' ' , whereupon i moved to the side of the road , parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my typewriter , and began typing the above conversation .	495.57394
the reporters were questioning the interior man and the french officer , both of whom remained noncommittal as to what action , if any , would be taken in my regard .	337.69598
finally they went off to file their stories , after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil .	1021.5259
the students crowded around asking questions , slapping me on the back , and generally being friendly .	557.1704
`` but what will you do this evening , mr . davis ' ' ? ?	54.05445
`` it will be very cold ' ' .	59.35504
`` i don ' t know ' ' , i told him , `` except that i will be here ' ' .	41.709637
`` i shall see about getting you a tent ' ' , he said .	222.13101
`` i have a small sports shop in strasbourg ' ' .	245.95834
that would be a great help , i told him , thanking him for his thoughtfulness .	730.31946
a special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure i didn ' t cross , the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men , women , and children , dogs , cats , horses , cars , trucks , baby carriages -- could cross kehl bridge into kehl without surveillance .	667.552
the day passed eventfully enough , with a constant stream of visitors , some stopping only to say hello , others getting into serious conversations , such as one andre fuchs , a free-lance journalist from strasbourg who wrote an article for the nouvelle alsatian in highly sympathetic terms .	1188.887
some students from the university returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week .	1475.6215
a volunteer food brigade had been arranged , they told me , which would supply me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge .	357.14755
a little later , the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent .	1309.0055
one of the girl students , sitting by while i ate the thick soup , asked me if i had a sleeping bag .	737.3064
when i informed her that i didn ' t , she said she would borrow her brother ' s and bring it to me later that evening .	137.26662
`` you do not know me ' ' , she said in good english , `` but my mother was your governess in philadelphia when you were a child ' ' .	185.91957
i was delighted to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances .	478.08148
the peter family proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days , mrs . peter , little esther , and raoul , who generously lent me his sleeping bag for my `` watch on the rhine ' ' .	558.8089
sighting a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side , i pitched the tent that evening on the stateless `` line ' ' , digging a small trench around it as best i could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child .	609.2595
the wind from the rhine was damp and chill , necessitating a fire for warmth .	2290.8225
after scouring around a bit in the open area , i came across what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly , giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky .	1509.3419
each evening the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits pains , esther usually being among them .	3548.7534
i had advised friends to write me to `` no man ' s land , pont kehl , between strasbourg and kehl , france-germany ' ' .	360.28183
sure enough , mail began trickling in , delivered by a talkative , highly amused french postman who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized .	1257.6403
on christmas eve , students brought out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the tent .	1591.5698
as the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural playground for the kids of the neighborhood , i had made many friends among them , taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately to translate grimm ' s fairy tales into an understandable french as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent .	826.32104
to my great surprise and delight , when they saw the two trees they went rushing off , returning shortly with decorations from their own trees .	689.5524
it was a merry if somewhat soggy christmas for me that year .	1758.3578
in the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of cologne , heidelberg , and baden-baden .	859.1596
twenty thousand world citizens at stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town .	1958.4681
when dr . adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find out his disposition of my case , he gave them his personal approval of my entry , saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into germany .	560.2884
the special guard , however , was still posted on kehl bridge .	463.8031
as it began raining at around eight o ' clock on december 26th , i retired into my tent early , somewhat tired and discouraged , my body reacting sluggishly because of the continued exposure .	1122.9539
no matter how large the fire , i couldn ' t seem to shake off the chill that day .	126.020294
`` oh , mr . davis , are you there ' ' ? ?	59.37636
a voice drifted in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after i had fallen into a fitful sleep .	1714.5707
`` who is it ' ' ? ?	6.1154056
`` we ' re from the council of europe , british delegation .	249.57301
may we have a word with you ' ' ? ?	33.983395
i ' ve had a trying day and i just can ' t make it out again ' ' , i told them .	126.7799
later i learned that sir hugh dalton had expressed a desire to see me , hence their trip to `` no man ' s land ' ' .	293.09076
on the evening of december 27th , esther noticed my pallid look and rasping voice .	13050.511
she entreated me to see a doctor , and when i refused , brought one out to see me .	270.19296
i wouldn ' t hear of it because it meant giving up the `` line ' ' , though i realized i was in poor shape physically .	463.8641
esther , mistaking my hesitation , assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in strasbourg whom she had already approached .	852.08344
`` no , it ' s not that ' ' , i told her .	58.157658
`` you see , once i relinquish the position i ' ve already established here , i couldn ' t regain it without sacrificing the logic of it ' ' .	383.76736
at that moment , up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from basel , switzerland .	2380.792
without preliminaries , esther asked him , `` if you are a world citizen , will you take garry davis ' place in his tent while he goes to the hospital ' ' ? ?	271.7178
`` but of course , with pleasure ' ' , he replied .	43.673496
i looked from her to him .	121.59083
`` what is your name ' ' ? ?	25.07842
`` shake ' ' , i said .	29.837202
`` you have just enlisted for the ' rhine campaign ' ' ' .	295.06714
esther jumped up , ran to him and gave him a little hug .	560.92487
now come , garry , we must go quickly .	134.37344
there is a police car outside .	481.4765
maybe they will take us ' ' .	29.221212
such were the incongruities of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me were drafted into driving me to the strasbourg hospital while world citizen jean babel waved adieu from the `` line ' ' ! !	801.4903
he remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy .	550.18945
when the victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted , with his horse pressed broadside against cleburne ' s log parapet in a tangled group of infantrymen .	2404.3186
his hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes .	379.9152
he never knew how he got there .	104.39073
six climactic minutes in an individual ' s life left no memory .	323.56277
eight hundred and sixty-five rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day .	728.7735
eight field guns were captured in position .	885.0094
seven battle flags and fourteen officers ' swords were sent to thomas ' headquarters .	1012.13416
it was the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign .	3206.7258
the fourteenth regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes , among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment .	1062.8452
the thirty-eighth regiment of ohio volunteers , one of the regiments in thomas ' first division during buell ' s command , suffered its greatest loss of the war in this action .	485.54208
a popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up stanley for this assault .	372.19623
sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall seeing thomas ride so fast .	439.98618
while thomas ' injured back led him to restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough when he had to .	881.75116
it is not in the record , but he must have galloped his horse at peach tree creek when he brought up ward ' s guns to save newton ' s crumbling line .	755.6784
while the final combat of the campaign was being worked out at jonesborough , thomas , on sherman ' s instructions , ordered slocum , now commanding the twentieth corps , to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without exposing his bridgehead to a counterattack .	671.9038
the dispatch must have been sent after sundown on september 1 .	1812.0514
slocum made his reconnaissanace the next morning , found the town empty , accepted the surrender of the mayor and occupied the city a little before noon .	603.56775
on the morning of september 2 the fourth corps and the armies of the tennessee and the ohio followed the line of hardee ' s retreat .	429.96344
about noon they came up with the enemy two miles from lovejoy ' s station and deployed .	691.20074
the fourth corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line .	229.03516
that night a note written in slocum ' s hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta .	888.5181
before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note to thomas .	562.67523
in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed on his heels .	855.90356
the cautious thomas re-examined the note and then , making up his mind that it was genuine , snapped his fingers , whistled and almost danced in his exuberance .	738.0138
the next day sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta .	1170.0332
the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice .	561.3931
sherman laid great store by place captures .	5846.7837
hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors .	1372.1603
by both standards thomas had the right to be proud .	125.987724
thomas thanked his men for their tenacity of purpose , unmurmuring endurance , cheerful obedience , brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle .	1650.1599
sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the larger fruits of victory .	438.41025
he supposed the military world would approve of his accomplishment .	381.03024
whatever the military world thought , the political world approved it wholeheartedly .	969.36597
for some time , despondency in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways -- an eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with lincoln .	996.5523
proposals were in the air for a year ' s armistice .	197.45561
lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected .	127.641365
in the midst of this gloom , at 10 05 p . m . on september 2 , slocum ' s telegram to stanton , `` general sherman has taken atlanta ' ' , shattered the talk of a negotiated peace and boosted lincoln into the white house .	355.30203
to the republicans no victory could have been more complete .	336.42142
official congratulations showered upon sherman and his army .	259.88626
lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability , courage and perseverance .	1139.7424
he felt that this campaign would be famous in the annals of war .	286.67496
grant called it prompt , skillful and brilliant .	680.1135
halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war .	99.59761
actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure .	230.0679
next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action .	361.10947
sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from lovejoy ' s to atlanta .	2120.9368
but , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful .	504.18332
within the narrow frame of military tactics , too , the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant .	337.5628
in seventeen weeks the military front was driven southward more than 100 miles .	1984.0405
there was a battle on an average of once every three weeks .	290.8238
in the summary of the principal events of the campaign compiled from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting .	487.55774
the casualties in the army of the cumberland were 22 , 807 , while for all three armies they were 37 , 081 .	1275.885
men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep .	237.11516
rifle fire often kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces .	1985.6722
modern warfare was born in this campaign -- periscopes , camouflage , booby traps , land mines , extended order , trench raids , foxholes , armored cars , night attacks , flares , sharpshooters in trees , interlaced vines and treetops , which were the forerunners of barbed wire , trip wires to thwart a cavalry charge , which presaged the mine trap , and the general use of anesthetics .	2876.539
the use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers began to select tactical points by designating a spot as `` near the letter o in the word mountain ' ' .	1600.274
a few weeks later the maps were being divided into squares and a position was described as being `` about lots 239 , 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196 ' ' .	1718.0914
this system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them from a mobile lithograph press .	2356.6548
orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement .	318.57632
sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks .	476.72382
to the rebels it seemed as if sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets .	911.5426
the whistle of sherman ' s locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish fire .	2015.6392
as always , the ranks worked out new and better tactics , but there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their military thinking .	795.3399
the fossilized , formalized , precedent-based thinking of the legendary military brain was not evident in sherman ' s armies .	635.8531
sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old .	1604.3961
one of sherman ' s most serious shortcomings , however , was his mistrust of his cavalry .	249.77315
he never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it .	220.86255
then , in some way , this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice .	528.3829
a horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with two pounds .	553.7487
the horseman required eleven times more than the footman .	1265.0122
he would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country .	463.3683
already debilitated by the chattanooga starvation , the quality of sherman ' s horseflesh ran downhill as the campaign progressed .	1186.3257
every recorded request by thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses .	570.0843
well led , properly organized cavalry , in its complementary role to infantry , had four functions .	732.59424
first , it could locate the enemy infantry , learn what they were doing , and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over .	711.76013
second , it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy .	700.8743
third , it could threaten at all times , and destroy when possible , the enemy communications .	605.078
it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier .	831.7245
its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign .	601.9094
thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet , but his plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum mobility and with its commander stripped from it .	687.9271
sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings .	1584.9559
his conception proved workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean , deft , well organized retreats with small materiel losses .	2154.4766
sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways , yet garrard ' s covington raid and rousseau ' s opelika raid cut two-thirds of the rail lines he had to break and sherman lived in mortal fear of what forrest might do to his communications .	1873.0914
when mcpherson pushed blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive movement , the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted infantry , totally inadequate for its role .	1289.2164
it stumbled on infantry where no infantry should have been and mcpherson ' s aggressive impulse faded out , overwhelmed by fears of the unknown .	1202.3284
a proper cavalry command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into one division of polk ' s army of the mississippi moving up from the direction of mobile to join johnston at dalton .	311.55063
from the night of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry east of the macon railway to disclose to sherman that he was missing the greatest opportunity of his career .	574.2964
a great part of the time , thomas ' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line .	287.16257
at such times thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike him .	1132.2028
it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes .	855.03467
heat during the atlanta campaign , coupled with unsuitable clothing , caused individual irritation that was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean clothing .	1405.6394
to relieve the itch and sweat galls , the men got into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private truce while the men went swimming .	2090.9302
johnston believed that sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various fords .	1068.2634
lieutenant colonel james p . brownlow , who commanded the first brigade of thomas ' first cavalry division , was ordered across one of these fords .	729.86755
the water was deep and brownlow took his troopers across naked -- except for guns , cartridge boxes and hats .	2279.3684
they kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels , drove the rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men .	1096.9684
most of the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff brush than their naked pursuers .	1377.3843
rank was becoming an explosive issue in all three of sherman ' s armies .	348.4827
merited recommendations from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees from civil life .	848.29016
in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of meynell , thompson told patmore of his distress at having had to leave london before this new friendship had developed further ``	798.2788
that was a very absurd and annoying situation in which i was placed by w . m . ' s curious methods of handling me .	268.69693
he never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was to leave for lymington .	789.19867
the result was that i found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week , only two days before my departure from london .	389.27957
luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not i ' ' .	190.60562
it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements , which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant .	872.3832
when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included fervent verses from pantasaph , mrs . king felt a proper victorian alarm .	2069.9282
some , she knew , looked upon thompson almost as a saint , but others read in `` the hound of heaven ' ' what they took to be the confessions of a great sinner , who , like oscar wilde , had -- as one pious writer later put it -- thrown himself `` on the swelling wave of every passion ' ' .	620.8828
consequently , on october 31 , 1896 , mrs . king wrote to thompson , quite against her daughter ' s wishes , asking him not to `` recommence a correspondence which i believe has been dropped for some weeks ' ' .	369.74908
katherine was staying at a convent , and her mother felt that , as thompson himself seems to have suggested , she might eventually stay there .	489.45877
this prospect did not please mrs . king any more than did the possibility that her daughter might marry a bohemian , but she used it to suggest to thompson that , `` it is not in her nature to love you ' ' .	296.50565
for his part , thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between katie and himself .	392.8985
at no time does he seem to have proposed marriage , and mrs . king was evidently torn between a concern for her daughter ' s emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation .	330.1077
in any case , she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see katie again , `` now that this frank explanation has been made & no one can misunderstand ' ' .	377.2874
she ended her letter with the assurance that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an honor , from which she could not part `` without still more pain ' ' .	503.54663
after thompson came to london to live , he received a letter from katie , which was dated february 8 , 1897 .	388.6054
she regretted what she described as the `` unwarrantable & unnecessary ' ' check to their friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another perfectly .	662.48535
this letter concluded with an invitation ``	875.4097
i am a great deal at the little children ' s hospital .	140.07623
i know you are very busy now , you are writing a great deal & your book is coming out , isn ' t it ? ?	446.31653
but if you are able & care to come , you know how glad i shall be .	331.73486
katherine douglas king ' ' the invitation was accepted and other letters followed , in which she spoke of her concern for his health and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled children she served .	440.93762
it is difficult to say what thompson expected would come of their relationship , which had begun so soon after his emotions had been stirred by maggie brien , but when katie wrote on april 11 , 1900 , to tell him that she was to be married to the rev . godfrey burr , the vicar of rushall in staffordshire , the news evidently helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse .	824.0397
in a letter to meynell , which was written in june , less than a month before katie ' s wedding , he was highly melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets ``	362.87753
a week in arrears , and without means to pay , i must go , it is the only right thing .	105.753395
perhaps mrs . meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book , with all its mementos of her and the dear ones .	612.6461
last , not least , there are some poems which k . king sent me ( addressed to herself ) when i was preparing a fresh volume , asking me to include them .	846.02234
the terrible blow of the new year put an end to that project .	229.05624
i wish you would return them to her .	121.376495
i never had the courage to look at them , when my projected volume became hopeless , fearing they were poor , until now when i was obliged to do so .	446.8681
o my genius , young and ripening , you would swear , -- when i wrote them	847.3397
what has it all come to ? ?	155.56236
all chance of fulfilling my destiny is over .	861.90314
i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems , dear father-brother , now i am gone	1625.3662
and launch them on the world when their time comes .	203.48625
for them a box will be lodgment enough .	697.2124
